Hong Kong police commissioner Chris Tang Ping-keung expressed his “full support” for the planned legislation on Monday. “Since June last year, the opposition to the proposed legislative amendments has led to massive violent protests (…) Police deeply realized that Hong Kong is at the risk point of national security and there is a need to take effective measures to prevent the situation from deteriorating,” the police said in a statement posted on its website. Thousands of people came out into the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday to protest against the security law, which they believe would take away many of the current freedoms for residents in the territory. At least 180 people were arrested during the demonstrations “for offenses like participating in an unauthorized assembly, unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct in a public place,” the police said in the statement on Sunday. The police accused some protesters of attacking police officials with bricks and umbrellas and added that “some rioters even allegedly threw glass bottles from the rooftop of a building on the ground, posing a serious threat to public safety.” The legislation would prohibit any act of “treason, secession, sedition and subversion” against the central government, in addition to theft of state secrets and the organization of activities in Hong Kong by foreign political groups. It is currently being debated in the Chinese National People’s Congress and is due to be approved before its conclusion on Thursday. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has expressed her full support for the legislation and a local government spokesperson said on Sunday that the new law will make the city safer. However, several civil organizations have condemned the measure being planned by Beijing saying it would limit the freedoms of Hong Kongers. Nonprofit Human Rights Watch said in a statement that the proposed law “threatens the basic rights and freedoms of the city’s people” and “will prohibit acts of ‘splittism, subversion, foreign intervention, and terrorism,’ vague terms that the Chinese government has frequently used on the mainland to punish peaceful dissent.” “Hong Kong people will now have to consider arrests and harsh sentences for protesting, speaking out, running for office, and other freedoms they have long enjoyed and struggled peacefully to defend,” it added. Another nonprofit, China Human Rights Defenders, also urged Beijing to reverse its decision saying the security law “would erase any existing political separation between the semi-democratic territory and the one-party authoritarian mainland China.” “The Chinese government must end its interference in the affairs of Hong Kong in violation of the Basic Law and ensure that the human rights of Hong Kong residents are fully respected. The international community must take necessary and appropriate actions to stop China’s violations of the Basic Law,” the organization added in a statement. Meanwhile, the Human Rights in China NGO said in another statement that the international community must be aware of the threat posed by a “non-accountable regime that dismisses its international commitments and ignores international standards.” Hong Kong has been gripped for several years by political unrest and demonstrations, which had been gaining momentum in the months leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, which led to them being suspended. The territory was returned to Chinese control in 1997 after a century and a half of British rule, after London and Beijing signed a joint declaration in 1984 under which the UK renounced its last Asian colony. This deal established a series of freedoms in the city for 50 years, many of which do not exist on mainland China. EFE-EPA hk-jco/pd/lds",0.0
1616071958,2020-05-25 08:16:06,Chinese security law for Hong Kong: End or restart of protests?,https://www.laprensalatina.com/chinese-security-law-for-hong-kong-end-or-restart-of-protests/,en,False,,287422,laprensalatina.com,http://laprensalatina.com/,"By Jesus Centeno Beijing, May 25 (efe-epa).- The new national security law for Hong Kong that the Beijing Government plans to approve this week will not only imply cuts in the freedoms of Hong Kong people, but could cause a political earthquake with unforeseeable consequences, according to various analysts. Its likely processing has appeared against all odds and is the issue that is raising the most dust in the National People’s Congress of China this year, focused on the management of the coronavirus by the authorities. The Hong Kong legislation, which according to the state press is still being debated, aims to “safeguard national security” in the wake of the protests that erupted last year, although it remains to be seen how it is implemented and whether its ultimate goal is to control the semi-autonomous city. Thus, it will prohibit “any act of treason, secession, sedition and subversion” against the central government, in addition to the “theft of state secrets and the organization of activities in Hong Kong by foreign political organizations,” terms that the Chinese Executive has previously used to curb dissent. However, Article 23 of the Basic Law (Hong Kong’s Magna Carta) stipulates that the city must endorse legislation in this area, something that has always been extremely controversial among the population for fear that it would result in a reduction of freedoms. “The Chinese government wants their word to be worth more and that the local government and Hong Kong society end up with much less autonomy and freedoms. The impact will be negative,” academic Jean-Pierre Cabestan, director of the Department of Political Science of the Baptist University of Hong Kong, told EFE. The expert believes that the “reinterpretation” of the Basic Law will only succeed in “reviving the protest movement,” and that it will clash with the one previously adopted in the United States in support of the Hong Kong opposition. Beijing wants at all costs to prevent Washington from influencing what it considers its “internal affairs,” with which the conflict is served: NGOs like the US Human Rights Watch have already asked the international community to “take action” in this regard and another In the same country, Human Rights in China, has warned of the “threat” posed by “an irresponsible regime that ignores its international commitments.” Professor and coordinator of pro-democratic groups Joseph Cheng told EFE that the law will be ready in six months. “Chinese leaders act in defiance of the international environment and the domestic situation. They want to tell the world that they are willing to pay the price (to shield Hong Kong). The law will be ready in six months,” says Cheng. He adds that the Hong Kong people are “disappointed and angry,” but that from now on they must calculate the cost that it will have to demonstrate against the government: “The fight will continue. That is why the support of international public opinion is important,” he said. Although the congress has not offered more details on the legislation, the official press is already campaigning to defend it: “The absence of a national security law is one of the reasons why Hong Kong became a chaotic place,” estimates one recent editorial in the Global Times newspaper. “Its value system has deviated from the normal path, and this must stop. If the Hong Kong government is in a difficult position to complete this task, the congress must take the responsibility given to it by the Constitution and the Basic Law,” it adds. Beijing ensures that freedoms will not be affected by the law and has the support of the controversial head of the Hong Kong Executive, Carrie Lam, and her entire government, who sees in the text an opportunity to make Hong Kong “one safer city.” In fact, thousands of Hong Kong people took to the streets Sunday to protest against the legislation and 180 of them were arrested, according to local police. However, experts indicate that the law could lead to a “reset” of the political agenda, resuming the commitment of the chief executive to the election, initially planned for 2017, whose limiting requirements would be omitted with this law.

Protesters in Quito marched through the streets chanting “Out Moreno, Out,” referring to right-wing President Lenin Moreno, who recently took the unusual step of delegating many of his powers to unelected aides with a year left in his term. Participants wore masks and practiced social distancing in the face of the coronavirus, which has claimed more than 3,200 lives in Ecuador, according to the official count. Most believe the true toll is much higher in light of data showing that Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city, and its environs suffered 9,400 “excess” deaths in March and April compared with the same period in 2019. Police charged at groups of students who set tires ablaze on a street near a square in downtown Quito and demonstrators took to social media to complain about the “aggressive” attitude of the motorcycle cops who confronted them. The students were demanding the withdrawal of bills to cut the education budget and the firing of Economy Minister Richard Martinez, who was likewise denounced by union leaders for his decision to make a $324 million payment to foreign creditors during a public health emergency. In March 2019, a year before the coronavirus reached Ecuador, the Moreno government dismissed more than 2,500 health-care employees, including 300 specialists in dealing with epidemics. Unions representing the medical sector took part in Monday’s mobilization in the capital to blast the government’s failure to punish officials found to have exploited the Covid-19 crisis for personal gain. Moreno was also taken to task for initially promising to prevent layoffs and then doing nothing as at least 150,000 people lost their jobs. Truckers at the protest complained of a new fuel distribution system that effectively eliminates subsidies – a move that sparked massive nationwide disturbances when Moreno first attempted it last year. A sign spotted at the demonstration in Quito seemed to sum up the mood: “The government lies to you, the bank cheats you, the boss exploits you and the police mistreat you … and they say that you are the criminal.” In a recent exchange with Efe, the governor of Pinchicha province, which surrounds Quito, warned that political discontent could amplify the effects of the pandemic. Paola Pabon, a government opponent, said that Moreno’s policies are leaving people with no choice but to protest, increasing the risk of contagion. EFE fa/dr",0.0

In an interview with Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post, infectious disease expert Zhong Nanshan praised the city’s efforts to contain COVID-19 and called for more cooperation between the authorities of Hong Kong and mainland Chinese to allow travel between the two sides without the need to undergo mandatory quarantine. “Hong Kong has done beautifully this time, totally different from how it did 17 years ago during Sars,” said the renowned 83-year-old Chinese pneumologist, who played a prominent role in the fight in 2003 against the disease, by which the former British colony was particularly affected. Zhong said the authorities should “take this step” and establish a health code system that is recognized on both sides. “I don’t think it’s that essential to be isolated in Hong Kong for 14 days. That’s because Hong Kong is facing a big economic problem,” he added. Hong Kong has not recorded any new coronavirus cases for more than ten days and there are 32 active cases in the city out of the 1,065 total infections detected since the beginning of the epidemic, with four deaths. Meanwhile, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced at a press conference on Tuesday that the city will ease some of the social distancing measures taken to combat the spread of COVID-19. Karaoke lounges and nightclubs will join other public places that have opened – including gyms and beauty salons – and will be able to resume operations from Friday, according to China’s state-run agency Xinhua. Flight transfer services at the Hong Kong International Airport will also resume while the city’s schools will gradually open from Wednesday. Lam also reiterated her support for the Hong Kong national security law that the government in Beijing plans to pass this week and assured that the freedoms of Hong Kong citizens are not in danger. Hong Kong’s police arrested at least 180 people on Sunday during a protest against the proposed legislation, which would prohibit any act of “treason, secession, sedition and subversion” against the central government, in addition to theft of state secrets and the organization of activities in Hong Kong by foreign political groups.

1616771881,2020-05-26 05:16:03,"Security law will not affect rights, freedoms in Hong Kong, says Lam",https://www.laprensalatina.com/security-law-will-not-affect-rights-freedoms-in-hong-kong-says-lam/,en,False,,287422,laprensalatina.com,http://laprensalatina.com/,"Hong Kong, May 26 (efe-epa).- Hong Kong’s chief executive on Tuesday defended the new national security law that Beijing plans to approve this week, promising that it will not weaken the high degree of autonomy of the city or the rights and freedoms of its residents. Carrie Lam was speaking at a press conference, her first public appearance since the Beijing authorities announced that they would push for a national security law for Hong Kong. The legislation, which is being debated at the National People’s Congress and which is likely to be approved this week, aims to prohibit “any act of treason, secession, sedition and subversion” against the central government, in addition to the “theft of state secrets and the organization of activities in Hong Kong by foreign political organizations.” The Hong Kong leader said that “in the last 23 years (since Hong Kong’s return to China), whenever people worried about Hong Kong’s freedom of speech and freedom of expression and protest, time and again, Hong Kong has proven that we uphold and preserve those values,” adding that it is necessary to understand why such legislation is needed at this time. Lam also denied that Beijing is bypassing the city’s legislative mechanisms to enact the law, pointing out that such an accusation ignores the constitutional relationship between the semi-autonomous city and the central government. The city’s pro-democracy movement believes that the national security law could have far-reaching consequences for the autonomy of the former British colony, governed by the ‘one country, two systems’ model, which gives power to the Hong Kong authorities over various issues such as immigration and monetary policies. “Beijing has just hammered the final nail in the coffin for Hong Kong’s autonomy. The promise of ‘one country, two systems’ is dead,” prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong wrote in a column published Monday in the United States newspaper The Washington Post. Lam also dismissed a statement from the Hong Kong Bar Association – which stated that the Chinese legislative does not have the power to impose the legislation – saying that its enactment will not go against the Basic Law (Hong Kong’s Magna Carta) and will be “strictly in accordance with the Chinese Constitution.” She called the international community’s criticism that the law would affect Hong Kong citizens’ freedoms and weaken the city’s financial status “nonsense.” Lam said such an arrangement is the general practice overseas and other countries have no right to interfere in China’s plans, and added that another “totally groundless” claim is that the national security legislation will undermine Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center. Fear of an impending crackdown sparked new protests in Hong Kong on Sunday, when some 180 people were arrested as police fired tear gas to disperse violent protesters. The protest was the biggest since January, when the anti-government movement stopped, largely due to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government in Hong Kong, the official office representing Beijing in the special administrative region, “strongly condemned the illegal assemblies and violent acts by rioters in Hong Kong,” Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported Tuesday. “The rioters blocked roads, vandalized public facilities, set fire, and beat up innocent people, causing severe damage to the security of people’s lives and properties and endangering national security,” Xinhua said quoting the Office spokesperson, adding that there were also calls for Hong Kong independence. “All these facts proved that it is imperative and urgent to introduce national security legislation for Hong Kong,” it added, citing the spokesperson. Pro-democracy activists plan to gather Wednesday in the vicinity of the Legislative Council (parliament) and block traffic while lawmakers deliberate on a controversial law that could penalize disrespect for the Chinese national anthem. The area around the headquarters has already cordoned off and it is expected that up to 3,000 police officers will be deployed. However, more people are expected for the march that the Civil Front for Human Rights calls every July 1. This day has emerged as an annual platform on which protesters demand universal suffrage and call for the defense of civil liberties, including freedom of expression. EFE-EPA msc-jco/tw",0.0
1617127095,2020-05-26 11:56:20,Scott County’s switch from blue county to red county,http://www.ihoneida.com/2020/05/26/scott-countys-switch-from-blue-county-to-red-county/,en,False,,547399,ihoneida.com,http://ihoneida.com/,"It has been called the most controversial finishes to a presidential election in America’s history — and, to date, it’s still the most tightly-contested finish in the electoral college: 1876, when Republican Rutherford B. Hayes defeated Democrat Samuel J. Tilden by the narrowest of margins, 185-184. Scott County played its own role in that 1876 election — splitting with much of the rest of Tennessee to vote for Hayes. A loyal Republican county As the November 2019 installment of Forgotten Times noted, Scott County — which had been formed by the Tennessee legislature in 1849 — became a reliable Republican county in the 1860s. While only one Scott Countian — Shadrack Lewallen — voted for Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 presidential election, a majority of Scott Countians voted for Lincoln when he sought re-election in 1864. In between, Scott County rejected secession from the Union by the largest margin of any county in Tennessee, and went so far as to declare its independence from Tennessee in protest of secession, adopting a resolution naming itself the Free and Independent State of Scott. Slave ownership was not an important issue in Scott County. There were slaves owned in Scott County, but there were fewer here than just about anywhere else in the antebellum South. According to the 1860 census, there were 61 slaves in Scott County — making the county one of just two in Tennessee with fewer than 100 slaves. By contrast, there were twice as many slaves owned in Morgan County and three times as many in Fentress County. So, with slavery considered unimportant and most people simply wanting to be left alone, Scott Countians overwhelmingly rejected secession. One can only speculate, but it probably didn’t help matters any that Nashville acted aggressively towards Scott County for its act of defiance. After being informed of Scott County’s resolution of independence, Gov. Isham Harris dispatched troops to the county with orders to arrest and hang members of county court, according to current county commissioner and author David Jeffers. While the troops turned back after encountering resistance, Scott County remained under Confederate control until the entire East Tennessee region was eventually liberated by the army of Union General William Burnside. Jehu Phillips, Scott County’s first trustee, wrote for the Cumberland Chronicle in 1904: “Before the Civil War the Whig and Democratic parties were about equally divided in this county. I was raised a Democrat, but after the war nearly every citizen in this county voted the Republican ticket and have been doing so in this county since that time.” Indeed, when Ulysses S. Grant won the presidency in an 1864 landslide, Scott Countians voted overwhelmingly for the former Union war general. More than 90% of local voters cast ballots for Grant. - Story Continues Below - That might not have been particularly noteworthy; most of Tennessee voted for Grant, and most of East Tennessee voted for him by margins that were similar to Scott County. But in 1872, when Grant sought re-election and again won in a landslide, Tennessee sided with his challenger, Liberal Republican Horace Greeley, who had the official support of the Democratic Party. While East Tennessee still voted lock-step for Grant, Scott County voted for the president by the largest margin of any county in the state — again, more than 90% of voters here cast ballots for Grant. A contentious election The 1876 election marked the triumphant return of the Democratic Party. The party did not field its own candidate in 1872, instead nominating Greeley, believing its only chance of unseating Grant was to unite around his challenger. But in 1876, the Democratic Party fielded a strong candidate in popular New York Governor Samuel J. Tilden. The Republicans, meanwhile, nominated Hayes, who was the governor of Ohio. And what followed was an election that could not have possibly been closer. Tilden won the popular vote — capturing 50.9% of the nation’s vote, compared to Hayes’ 47.9%. Yet, Hayes emerged victorious in the electoral college, after being awarded all of the electoral votes in four contested states. The process was an intriguing compromise between Democrats and Republicans, one that served as a catalyst for the end of the Reconstruction period. But Tilden refused to go down without a fight, and the constitutional crisis persisted into March 1877 before Hayes was finally sworn in without further dispute. Until the inauguration ceremony, Grant had been quietly building the U.S. Army’s presence in the nation’s capital and preparing for the possibility of martial law. After the first count of votes in 1876, Tilden had 184 and Hayes had 165. But four states were disputed, including three in the South: South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana were joined by Oregon in dispute. In all three of the disputed Southern states, Tilden was reported to have won the popular vote. However, there were widespread reports of electoral fraud, and black voters — who voted overwhelmingly Republican, for obvious reasons — endured threats of violence. In South Carolina, 101% of all eligible voters cast ballots. Democrats in Southern states printed the Republican symbol — Abraham Lincoln — on their ballots to entice illiterate voters to unintentionally vote for Tilden. As the election improprieties came to light, the Republican-dominated election commissions in the three states — controlled by the GOP as a result of the Union’s Civil War victory and defeat of the Confederacy’s rebellion — discounted enough Democrat votes for Hayes to be declared the winner in each state. That gave Hayes a 185-184 lead in the electoral college. Democrats, of course, cried foul. It appeared Congress would have to determine the election’s outcome. Since the Constitution states that the president of the Senate is to open and count electoral certificates, Republicans argued that the power to count votes lay solely with the president of the upper chamber — a Republican, Thomas W. Ferry. But Democrats countered that in each presidential election since the end of the Civil War, it had been the practice of Congress for contested votes to be counted by both houses. Since Democrats controlled the House, that would have tilted things in Tilden’s favor. Eventually, a law was passed to form a 15-member Electoral Commission, split evenly between Republicans and Democrats, with the 15th member being Supreme Court Justice David Davis, an independent. Democrats attempted to sway Davis’s support; the state legislature of Illinois elected Davis to the U.S. Senate. But Davis surprised them — he resigned his position on the Supreme Court to assume his duties in the Senate. As a result, he was off the Electoral Commission, and all the remaining Supreme Court justices were Republicans. The commission voted 8-7, strictly along party lines, to award all 20 contested electoral college votes to Hayes, thus making him the victor of the 1876 presidential election. As a part of the compromise that resulted, Democrats agreed to accept the decision — thus ending the constitutional crisis — in exchange for Republicans withdrawing federal troops from South Carolina and Louisiana, the last two Southern states still being occupied by the military. As a result, Reconstruction ended. Studies that have followed since the 1876 election have concluded that Hayes would likely have won the election by a wider margin if voter intimidation, fraud and violence had not occurred in the South. Because blacks made up a majority of voters in South Carolina and Louisiana, it has been considered likely that Hayes would have won those two states, along with Mississippi — where blacks were also a majority — while Tilden would have won Ohio, where white voters were in the majority. In those days, Mississippi had twice as many electoral college votes (8) as Florida (4). Tennessee’s vote in 1876 Like most of the rest of the former Confederacy, Tennessee voted for Tilden in the 1876 election. The Democratic candidate captured nearly 60% of the vote in Tennessee; Hayes had just over 40%. But the same geographical split that had developed during the secession battles of 1861 persisted: Middle Tennessee and West Tennessee voted blue, while East Tennessee — which, as a region, had been opposed to secession 15 years earlier — voted red. And in Scott County, the future words of Jehu Phillips were being proven true. As it had done in 1861, on the referendum of secession, and as it had done in 1868 when Grant was re-elected, Scott County voted for Hayes by a larger margin than any other county in Tennessee. More than 80% of voters here cast ballots for the Republican. The only other county in East Tennessee where that happened was Sevier County. In fact, with the exception of a handful of counties in eastern Louisiana’s plantation country, and one county in Mississippi, there was no other county anywhere in the South where 80% or more of the voters cast their ballots for Hayes. The trends haven’t changed much in more than 150 years. Scott Countians voted for Republican Donald Trump by the second-largest margin of any Tennessee county in 2016, and they did the same for Republican Bill Lee for governor in 2018.

Moreover, two teenagers were reportedly arrested for having been found to be in possession of Molotov cocktails, the island’s state media RTHK reported. For its part, the Hong Kong government said in a statement that since 05.30 am local time Wednesday, several individuals tried to block some streets in an attempt to block traffic in protest. Meanwhile, several protesters circulated messages on the internet urging people to go to the Legislative Council to express their opposition to the bill. The discussion on the so-called National Anthem Bill comes at a tense moment in the semi-autonomous city. Last week, protests and clashes took place between demonstrators and the police after it news broke out that the Chinese legislature planned to pass a national security law that could cut down on freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. According to Chinese National People’s Congress (NPC, or the legislature), the national security law will prohibit “any act of treason, secession, sedition and subversion” against the central government, in addition to the “theft of state secrets and the organization of activities in Hong Kong by foreign political organizations,” terms that the Chinese Executive has previously used to curb dissent. This move comes after nearly a year of pro-democracy mobilizations that have severely jolted Hong Kong’s economy and also resulted in clashes between the police and several violent protesters. Article 23 of the Basic Law (which governs Hong Kong) stipulates that the city must endorse legislation on security made by Beijing, something that has always been extremely controversial among the population for fear that it would result in a reduction of freedoms. Among the seven articles proposed by Beijing, there is a provision for a legal mechanism allowing the NPC to make laws against a number of cases, including “subversion of state power”, an accusation frequently used against human rights activists in China. Hong Kong has been gripped for several years by political unrest and demonstrations, which had been gaining momentum in the months leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, which led to them being suspended.

State media RTHK said the protesters raised slogans such as “Disband the police immediately,” and “Five demands not one less,” one of the most repeated ones since the protests began last year. They also tried to block traffic on the streets with items such as trash cans, amid the riot police warning them that they risked being arrested for illegal assembly if they did not disperse. Some shops in the area decided to ask their customers to leave and closed down over fears of the unrest escalating. Shortly after 2pm local time, police issued a statement that the protesters were disrupting traffic and urged them to leave as soon as possible, while warning it would use minimum necessary force to enforce the law. The Legislative Council (the Hong Kong parliament) on Wednesday was scheduled to debate on a draft law seeking to penalize “disrespect” to the March of the Volunteers, or the Chinese national anthem. If approved, anyone who found to misuse or show disrespect to the anthem would face sentences of up to three years in prison and fines of up to HK$50,000. According to local media reports, security forces were preparing to deploy some 3,000 anti-riot officers in the city in the face of calls for mass protests by pro-democracy organizations. Earlier during the day, a few hundred protesters came out on the streets in different parts of the city, leading to the arrest of at least 16 people, and three of them were carrying Molotov cocktails. Unrest has been fostering again in Hong Kong in recent days due to Beijing’s announcement that it was preparing a national security law for the semi-autonomous city, which is likely to be passed on Thursday.

1617944382,2020-05-27 00:49:54,What we know about the death of George Floyd: 4 Minneapolis police officers fired after 'horrifying' video hits social media,http://rssfeeds.tennessean.com/~/625263896/0/nashville/home~What-we-know-about-the-death-of-George-Floyd-Minneapolis-police-officers-fired-after-horrifying-video-hits-social-media/,en,False,,73100,blogs.tennessean.com,http://blogs.tennessean.com/#spider,"Government officials and Minnesota locals alike expressed outrage after a video surfaced showing a white police officer kneeling on the neck of a black man and ignoring his pleas for help until first responders put him, unresponsive, on a stretcher. The man, identified at 46-year-old George Floyd, died at a local hospital, according to police. The case echoes the death of Eric Garner, another black man who died while a white officer restrained him, ignoring pleas of ""I can't breathe."" The four officers involved in the Monday incident were fired Tuesday, and the attorney for Floyd's family, Ben Crump, called for their arrests. The officers have yet to be officially identified, but attorney Tom Kelly told The Associated Press he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd's neck. Kelly declined further comment. Here's what we know so far: What's in the video? A video taken by a bystander circulating on social media shows Chauvin with his knee pressed into Floyd's neck while the man repeatedly says he can't breathe. Floyd repeatedly pleads with Chauvin, at one point crying out for his mother and saying ""everything hurts."" Two officers are featured prominently in the video — Chauvin and an officer who stands between bystanders and the officer on top of Floyd. “He’s talking, he’s fine,” one officer says to a person off-camera. GBI says investigation wrapping up:Man who filmed Ahmaud Arbery shooting arrested “He ain’t fine,” the person replies before calling the officer a “bum” and saying he’s “enjoying what’s happening.” Chauvin keeps his knee pressed into Floyd’s neck and Floyd stops talking. About four minutes into the video, Floyd becomes unresponsive. Bystanders approach Chauvin and the officer draws something, causing one of the people off-camera to say, “He’s got mace.” Bystanders repeatedly ask the officers to check for a pulse. Chauvin doesn’t remove his knee from the man's neck until EMS puts an unresponsive Floyd onto a stretcher, roughly four minutes after he stopped responding. What is a 'neck restraint'? The Minneapolis Police Department's Policy & Procedure Manual defines a neck restraint as a ""non-deadly force option."" The handbook reads: ""Defined as compressing one or both sides of a person’s neck with an arm or leg, without applying direct pressure to the trachea or airway (front of the neck). Only sworn employees who have received training from the MPD Training Unit are authorized to use neck restraints."" The book has two types of neck restraints: Conscious Neck Restraint: The subject is placed in a neck restraint with intent to control, and not to render the subject unconscious, by only applying light to moderate pressure. Unconscious Neck Restraint: The subject is placed in a neck restraint with the intention of rendering the person unconscious by applying adequate pressure. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, speaking to reporters Tuesday, was asked about the use of the knee on Floyd's neck during the arrest. “We clearly have policies in place regarding placing someone under control,” Arradondo said, explaining that those policies “will be part of the full investigation we’ll do internally.” What do police say happened? The Minneapolis Police Department released a statement Monday that said officers responded to a report of a forgery in progress just after 8 p.m. Police discovered a suspect and ordered him to get out of his car. ""After he got out, he physically resisted officers,"" MPD said in a statement. ""Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress. Officers called for an ambulance. He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance where he died a short time later."" No weapons were used by anyone in the incident, according to the MDP statement, and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was called to investigate the incident. Calling police:White woman fired after calling police on black man who asked her to leash her dog Police on Tuesday updated the statement to add, ""As additional information has been made available, it has been determined that the Federal Bureau of Investigations will be a part of this investigation."" The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office is assisting with the investigation. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension released a statement saying, ""The names of the officers involved will be released once initial interviews with incident participants and witnesses have taken place."" Who are George Floyd and Derek Chauvin? Floyd, who worked security at Conga Latin Bistro, was described as a ""gentle giant,"" the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported Tuesday. On Facebook, the restaurant posted pictures of Floyd, including one of him smiling at the camera in a ""security"" T-shirt. The caption reads, ""We will always remember you."" Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, whom police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 in a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. What's the response? The four officers involved in the incident were fired, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted Tuesday afternoon. On Facebook, Frey said, ""Being Black in America should not be a death sentence."" ""Whatever the investigation reveals, it does not change the simple truth, he should still be with us this morning,"" the mayor said. ""I believe what I saw and what I saw is wrong on every level."" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz also took to social media to demand answers. Sen. Amy Klobuchar called the video ""horrifying"" and ""gut-wrenching"" and called for an investigation. More:Indiana lawmaker accused of racism for posting meme of black children celebrating 'free money' ""The lack of humanity in this disturbing video is sickening,"" Walz tweeted. ""We will get answers and seek justice."" Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, called for a ""thorough"" FBI investigation. ""George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice,"" Biden tweeted. ""His life mattered. I'm grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved — they must be held responsible for their egregious actions."" Protesters filled the intersection in the street where Floyd died on Tuesday night, chanting and carrying banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” They eventually marched about 21/2 miles to a city police precinct, with some protesters damaging windows, a squad car and spraying graffiti on the building. A line of police in riot gear eventually confronted the protesters, firing tear gas and projectiles. Some protesters kicked canisters back toward police. Some protesters stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station, and though steady rain diminished the crowd, tense skirmishes stretched late into the evening. Crump, who is also part of the team representing the family of Ahmaud Arbery, the black jogger who was shot and killed after allegedly being pursued by a white father and son in Georgia, called the firing of the four officers a good ""first step"" in a statement. On Twitter, Crump called for the four officers to be arrested on murder charges. ""How many 'while black' deaths will it take until the racial profiling and undervaluing of black lives by police finally ends?"" Crump said in a statement. Contributing: The Associated Press.",0.0

Four officers were fired a day after George Floyd’s death, a stunning and swift move by the Minneapolis chief with the mayor’s full backing. But despite their dismissal, whether the incident will be considered criminal, or even excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate. The officers were dismissed soon after a bystander’s video taken outside a south Minneapolis grocery store Monday night showed an officer kneeling on the handcuffed man’s neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving. Floyd’s death prompted protests Tuesday, with thousands taking to the streets at the intersection where he died. Many protesters marched more than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) to the police precinct station in that part of the city, with some damaging the building’s windows and squad cars and spraying graffiti. Police in riot gear eventually confronted them with tear gas and projectiles, with tense skirmishes stretching late into the evening. Bridgett Floyd told NBC’s “Today” show in an interview Wednesday morning that the officers involved in her brother’s death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she hadn’t watched the bystander’s video, but told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that “I don’t understand how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that.” Mayor Jacob Frey announced the firings on Twitter, saying: “This is the right call.” The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd’s death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. But in the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit, and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed. The officers in the Minneapolis incident haven’t even been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further. The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned. During Tuesday’s protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” And some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the department would conduct a full internal investigation, and prosecutors will decide whether to file criminal charges against the officers involved. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office said it was “shocked and saddened” by the video and pledged to handle the case fairly. Part of that investigation will likely focus on the intent of the officers, whether they meant to harm Floyd or whether it was a death that happened in the course of police work. The FBI was investigating whether the officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook. A chokehold is considered a deadly force option and involves someone obstructing the airway. According to the department’s use-of-force policy, officers are to use only an amount of force necessary that would be objectively reasonable. But two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long, noting that the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.” “He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.” In a post on his Facebook page, the mayor, who is white, apologized Tuesday to the black community for the officer’s treatment of Floyd, 46, who worked security at a restaurant. “Being Black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a Black man’s neck. Five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you’re supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense,” Frey posted. Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest. The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement. Even in the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 100,000 people in the U.S. and prompted police departments around the country to change how they’re doing work, the officers in the video aren’t wearing masks. In some cities, low-level arrests such as attempted forgery are skipped right now. Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts … I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.” But Floyd slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics. Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said. At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?” The Hennepin County medical examiner identified Floyd but said the cause of death was pending. Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant’s owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.” Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights and personal injury attorney, said he had been hired by Floyd’s family. The death came amid outrage over the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was fatally shot Feb. 23 in Georgia after a white father and son pursued the 25-year-old black man they had spotted running in their subdivision. More than two months passed before charges were brought. Crump also represents Arbery’s father.

The disturbing video of Monday night's death — during which a white officer's knee was planted firmly on George Floyd's neck and his desperate calls for help were ignored — has prompted protests in the Minnesota city and demands for charges for the officers involved. At a news conference Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to ""act on the evidence before him"" and press charges on the arresting officer. ""Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail? If you had done it or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now. And I cannot come up with a good answer to that question,"" Frey told a news conference Wednesday. ""We watched for five whole excruciating minutes as a white officer firmly pressed his knee into the neck of an unarmed, handcuffed black man,"" he added, noting that the arresting officer was not practicing a technique condoned by the city's police. ""I saw no threat; I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary."" Frey refrained from specifying what charges he would like to see, citing a desire not to impede investigators. But Floyd's sister Bridgett went one step further on national television earlier Wednesday. ""I would like for those officers to be charged with murder because that's exactly what they did,"" she told the Today show. ""They murdered my brother; he was crying for help."" She said the family, which has retained legal representation, is far from satisfied with the announcement that the four officers in the video have been fired — a swift decision that Frey said was ""the right call."" The Minneapolis Police Department has not publicly confirmed the officers' identities, and it said the FBI is also investigating the circumstances of Floyd's death. The announcement also failed to satisfy protesters who on Tuesday evening thronged to the department's 3rd Precinct, where clashes erupted between demonstrators and law enforcement in riot gear. As Minnesota Public Radio reported, the demonstrators damaged the building and a squad car in a confrontation that eventually saw police firing tear gas into the crowd. ""What we witnessed today was state-sponsored murder, a state-sponsored execution,"" Steven Belton, president of the nonprofit Urban League Twin Cities, said at a gathering of local civil rights leaders earlier Tuesday outside City Hall. ""And what we await to see is whether it's going to become state-sanctioned execution. It'll be sanctioned if nothing is done."" The controversy engulfing Minneapolis is not unfolding in a vacuum. Already a video recorded earlier this year in Georgia — depicting the death of an unarmed black man, who was followed and shot by two white men while out for a jog three months ago — has renewed questions about the conduct of local police, who did not arrest the men until after the video surfaced this month. And this week, a recorded encounter in New York City's Central Park caught fire after it was posted to social media. In the video, a white woman calls the police on a black man, who says he had simply asked her to leash her dog while he was out bird-watching. ""He's recording me and threatening me and my dog,"" she tells emergency operators multiple times as the man recording her keeps his distance. After the video surfaced, the woman was fired by her employer, the investment firm Franklin Templeton. The video recorded in Minneapolis more closely called to mind an earlier death in New York City, however. Like Eric Garner, who died after an officer's chokehold in 2014, Floyd's final words before he appeared to lose consciousness were a plea for help: ""I can't breathe."" Floyd is seen wailing the phrase several times with his face planted on the pavement, his hands apparently cuffed behind his back and a male officer kneeling on his neck. Observers standing nearby are heard telling officers that Floyd's nose was bleeding and that he was dying. The officer and his colleagues show little reaction as the man gradually goes silent. The officer does not lift his weight off Floyd's neck throughout most of the video until medical workers arrive to lift him into an ambulance on a stretcher. The New York City police officer who used the chokehold on Garner, Daniel Pantaleo, was never charged with a crime but was fired last year on a judge's recommendation. The Floyd family's attorney emphasized the link with Garner in comments Wednesday to the Today show. ""It's worse than Eric Garner in many ways,"" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said, ""because you hear the people even pleading with them, 'Please get your knee off his neck. Have some humanity; this is a human being,' "" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement Tuesday, ""There must be a complete and thorough outside investigation into what occurred, and those involved in this incident must be held accountable.

""After careful study of developments over the reporting period, I certified to Congress today that Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under United States laws in the same manner as U.S. laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997,"" Pompeo said in a statement released Wednesday. ""No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground."" The secretary announced his decision at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China. President Trump has blamed Chinese authorities for failing to prevent the coronavirus from becoming a global pandemic, noting that his administration is ""not going to take it lightly."" And earlier this month the Senate trained its legislative fire on China, with a unanimously passed bill that could force some foreign companies off U.S. stock exchanges. The State Department also has pushed back hard against China's recent plans for an aggressive new security law that would criminalize behavior in Hong Kong seen as critical of Beijing. In a statement shortly after news of the proposed legislation surfaced, Pompeo called it ""a death knell for the high degree of autonomy."" For more than two decades, the semiautonomous region has been governed under a principle Beijing calls ""one country, two systems,"" which allows Hong Kong certain freedoms from the communist economic and legal systems practiced on mainland China. Partly for that reason, the U.S. treats Hong Kong as separate from the rest of China as long as the city remains sufficiently autonomous. But the relationship between Beijing and Hong Kong's residents has grown increasingly fraught in recent years, with the city periodically erupting into massive demonstration against what protesters and the U.S. call Beijing's attempts to encroach on its freedoms. The region again saw clashes between protesters and riot police last weekend. One of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, Joshua Wong, urged leaders abroad to reconsider whether its ""special trade status can still be held since, once the law is implemented, Hong Kong will be assimilated into China's authoritarian regime, on both rule of law and human rights protections."" Now, that status appears in jeopardy with the Trump administration's reappraisal. ""Hong Kong and its dynamic, enterprising and free people have flourished for decades as a bastion of liberty, and this decision gives me no pleasure,"" Pompeo said Wednesday. ""But sound policymaking requires a recognition of reality. While the United States once hoped that free and prosperous Hong Kong would provide a model for authoritarian China, it is now clear that China is modeling Hong Kong after itself.""

1618497290,2020-05-27 17:50:00,Protesters mass in Hong Kong as anthem law is debated,https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/news/20200527/protesters-mass-in-hong-kong-as-anthem-law-is-debated?rssfeed=true,en,False,,106478,columbiadailyherald.com,http://columbiadailyherald.com/,"HONG KONG — Thousands of protesters shouted pro-democracy slogans and insults at police in Hong Kong on Wednesday as lawmakers debated a bill criminalizing abuse of the Chinese national anthem in the semi-autonomous city. Police massed outside the legislative building ahead of the session and warned protesters that if they did not disperse, they could be prosecuted. In the Central business district, police raised flags warning protesters to disperse before they shot pepper balls at the crowd and searched several people. More than 50 people in the Causeway Bay shopping district were rounded up and made to sit outside a shopping mall, while riot police with pepper spray patrolled and warned journalists to stop filming. In the Mong Kok district in Kowloon, some protesters set cardboard boxes and plastic on fire as demonstrations carried on into the night. The blaze was put out by firefighters. Across Hong Kong, 360 people were arrested on charges including unauthorized assembly, possession of items that could be used for unlawful purposes — such as gasoline bombs — to driving slowly and blocking traffic, according to Facebook posts by the Hong Kong police force. The bill would make it illegal to insult or abuse the Chinese national anthem, “March of the Volunteers” in semi-autonomous Hong Kong. Those guilty of the offense would face up to three years in prison and a fine of 50,000 Hong Kong dollars ($6,450). Opponents of the bill say it is a blow to freedom of expression in the city, while Beijing officials say it will foster a patriotic spirit and socialist values. “Western democracies all have laws to protect their national flags, national anthems and emblems. Any insulting acts toward these symbols would also be criminal,” pro-Beijing lawmaker Tony Tse said in the legislative debate. Tse said the bill would not affect human rights or force people to love the country or support any political power. “The purpose of this is to protect the dignity of a country,” he said. Pro-democracy lawmaker Charles Mok disagreed, saying the legislation would not help gain the respect of people and was an excuse to control freedom, speech and ideas of people. “We oppose the second reading of the national anthem bill, not because we don’t respect the national anthem. The national anthem is a symbol of the country’s dignity. If it wants to be respected, then let this government first respect the rights and freedoms of its people first,” Mok said. The debate over the anthem bill is expected to continue on Thursday. The bill was proposed in January 2019 after spectators from Hong Kong jeered at the anthem during high-profile international soccer matches in 2015. Last year, FIFA fined the Hong Kong Football Association after fans booed the national anthem at a World Cup qualifying game. Hong Kong was returned to China from British colonial rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” framework that promised freedoms not found on the mainland. Anti-China sentiment has risen as residents see Beijing moving to erode those rights. Mass protests in 2014, known as the Umbrella Revolution, followed the Chinese government’s decision to allow direct election of the city leader only after it screened candidates. In the end, the plan for direct elections was dropped. Legislation proposed in Hong Kong last year that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China for trials set off months of demonstrations that at times involved clashes between protesters and police. The legislation was withdrawn. China’s ceremonial parliament now meeting in Beijing has moved to enact a national security law for Hong Kong aimed at forbidding secessionist and subversive activity, as well as foreign interference and terrorism. Hong Kong’s own government has been unable to pass such legislation due to opposition in the city, and Beijing advanced the law itself after the protests last year. Asked about possible U.S. retaliation over the security legislation, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in Beijing that China would take necessary steps to fight back against what he called “erroneous foreign interference in Hong Kong’s affairs.”",0.0
1618497282,2020-05-27 17:51:05,Four Minneapolis officers fired following death of George Floyd,https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/news/20200527/four-minneapolis-officers-fired-following-death-of-george-floyd?rssfeed=true,en,False,,106478,columbiadailyherald.com,http://columbiadailyherald.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS — Four Minneapolis officers involved in the arrest of a black man who died in police custody were fired Tuesday, hours after a bystander’s video showed an officer kneeling on the handcuffed man’s neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving. Mayor Jacob Frey announced the firings on Twitter, saying “This is the right call.” The man’s death Monday night was under investigation by the FBI and state law enforcement authorities. It immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. In a post on his Facebook page, Frey apologized Tuesday to the black community for the officer’s treatment of the man, who was later identified as 46-year-old George Floyd, who worked security at a restaurant. “Being Black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a Black man’s neck. Five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you’re supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense,” Frey posted. Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest. The video starts with the shirtless man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement. Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” The man calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts … I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.” But Floyd stops talking and slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics. Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said. At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?” The Hennepin County medical examiner identified Floyd but said the cause of death was pending. Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.” Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights and personal injury attorney, said he had been hired by Floyd’s family. He called firing the officers “a good first step on the road to justice” for Floyd but said the city must “fix the policies and training deficiencies that permitted this unlawful killing to occur.” Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the department would conduct a full internal investigation. Police did not identify the officers, but attorney Tom Kelly confirmed he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd’s neck. Kelly declined to comment further. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. News accounts show he was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, whom police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 in a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Protesters filled the intersection Tuesday evening in the street where Floyd died, chanting and carrying banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” They eventually marched about 2 1/2 miles to a city police precinct, with some protesters damaging windows, a squad car and spraying graffiti on the building. A line of police in riot gear eventually confronted the protesters, firing tear gas and projectiles. Some protesters kicked canisters back toward police. Some protesters stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station, and though steady rain diminished the crowd, tense skirmishes stretched late into the evening. Experts on police use of force told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long. They noted the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.” “He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.” The New York City officer in the Garner case said he was using a legal maneuver called “the seatbelt” to bring down Garner, whom police said had been resisting arrest. But the medical examiner referred to it as a chokehold in the autopsy report and said it contributed to his death. Chokehold maneuvers are banned under New York police policy. A grand jury later decided against indicting the officers involved in Garner’s death, sparking protests around the country. The New York Police Department ultimately fired the officer who restrained Garner, but it was five years later, after a federal investigation, a city prosecutor’s investigation and an internal misconduct trial. In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook. A chokehold is considered a deadly force option and involves someone obstructing the airway. According to the department’s use-of-force policy, officers are to use only an amount of force necessary that would be objectively reasonable. Before the officers were fired, the police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which would handle any prosecution of police on state criminal charges, said in a statement that it was “shocked and saddened” by the video and pledged to handle the case fairly. The FBI is investigating whether the officers willfully deprived Floyd of his rights. If those federal civil rights charges are brought, they would be handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Minnesota, which declined comment. The death came amid outrage over the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was fatally shot Feb. 23 in Georgia after a white father and son pursued the 25-year-old black man they had spotted running in their subdivision. More than two months passed before charges were brought. Crump also represents Arbery’s father.",0.0

The protest in Memphis was in front of the Midtown police precinct, and police shut down a portion of Union Avenue during the protest. It started around 7:30 p.m. when 20-30 people began a silent protest in reaction to the death of Floyd. They were lined up along Union until a small group of counter-protesters showed up across the street. The night became contentious with both sides yelling at each other as tensions rose. Police stepped in, shutting down Union and allowing both sides to protest without coming in contact with the other. Officers took three of the demonstrators, Laura Mason, Dominic Vietti, Joangela Sigala and Tony Liggins, into custody and charged them with obstruction of a highway. Vietti was also charged with inciting a riot while Sigala and Liggins face disorderly conduct charges. Another woman, Katherine Pace, allegedly hit an officer in the back of the neck during the protest. She was charged with assault. Chief Sam Hines with the Memphis Police Department stepped forward to address the crowd, saying “We’ve had about five or six homicides over the Memorial Day weekend. Is anybody excited about stopping those? Is anybody excited about protesting against those individuals, those victims, those fathers, those sons and brothers that were killed?” Thursday morning, Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland released a statement on behalf of himself and Police director Michael Rallings on the protests: I understand and share your frustration with what happened in Minneapolis and other parts of the country. Police Director, Mike Rallings shares your frustration, and so do all the true police officers—men and women who put on the uniform every day to protect and serve. All cities and police departments have a responsibility to protect citizens from harm and to fight crime. But all of us—city governments, police departments, and the public—should expect police to protect and serve in a way that is responsible. It’s right and understandable for people to express their frustration through peaceful protest; however, I wish last night’s protesters would have all had on masks, been six feet apart, and gone through the proper channels to ensure everyone’s safety. By not doing so, protesters and our officers were unnecessarily put at risk. I’m proud of the Memphis Police Department and the way our officers conducted themselves last night. Mayor Jim Strickland President Donald Trump called for an expedited investigation into Floyd’s death. In wake of the video of Floyd’s arrest surfacing on social media, many people have called for the arrest of the officers involved.

The protest, which was shared earlier on social media, began around 7:30 p.m. when a small crowd of individuals parked their cars on Rembert Street and exited vehicles carrying Black Lives Matter signs. Within an hour, a crowd of 50-60 protesters faced off across the street from the Memphis Police Department precinct on Union Avenue, facing several dozen officers and the two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. One held a sign reading “police lives matter comply Confederate 901"" and the other with a sign reading ""all lives matter."" Memphis police temporarily shut down a portion of Union Avenue from Barksdale Street to McLean Boulevard after the confrontation grew. When the protest started around 7:30 p.m., about 40 people gathered on the north side of Union, holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “stop killing black people” and “silence is violence.” Floyd and Taylor died during interactions with police officers. Earlier this week, Floyd died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for an extended period. Taylor was shot and killed in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant. Arbery was shot and killed while out jogging outside Brunswick, Georgia, after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect. What we know about death of George Floyd: 4 Minneapolis police officers fired after 'horrifying' video hits social media Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up. Keara Akinmoladun, whose husband helped organize the protest along with a group of local black educators, said she wanted lawmakers and people across the country to know that Memphis stood in solidarity with those protesting and grieving across the country.

Both identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. In the past, the group has targeted Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer online for her role in protesting the equestrian statue of Nathan Bedford Forrest, which has since been removed from what is now Health Sciences Park. Several of the protesters crossed the street to confront the two men. MPD officers kept the two parties physically apart, but as the verbal confrontation escalated, more protesters started to cross Union and some stopped in the middle of the street, kneeling and blocking traffic.

About 50 MPD officers were on the scene with about 30 standing between the protesters and the two counter-demonstrators, who stood outside the MPD precinct on Union Avenue. About 40 MPD vehicles and a K-9 unit were also present. No other counter-protesters were seen joining Johnson and Dunkin, who left the lawn of the precinct around 9 p.m., telling MPD officers that they appreciated them. At least two individuals were handcuffed during the protest. Lt. Karen Rudolph said she could not provide a reason for the detainment until a report had been entered into the system.

After Bond said her piece, Hines asked the protesters if they would show the same enthusiasm and outrage for ""those individuals, those victims, those fathers, those sons and brothers that were killed,"" in reference to the homicides that occurred in Memphis over the weekend. Hines told Bond that if she had a complaint about the conduct of an officer, she should file it with the police department. Hines, flanked by several officers, walked behind the barricade. He then motioned for the more than 20 officers lined up behind the barricade across Union Avenue at Barksdale Street to withdraw and back away. They did, slowly and resumed their positions about 30 feet behind the barricades. The protesters then turned and headed west down Union again.

Moments after the barricades went up, many of the protesters started to back away and spread farther across the parking lot.

Police said they were investigating the death as a homicide and had a suspect in custody, but were still investigating what led to the shooting. Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old George Floyd died on Memorial Day after an officer knelt on his neck until he became unresponsive. News helicopter footage showed protesters milling in streets near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, with some running in and out of nearby stores. A Target, a Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an auto parts store all showed signs of damage and looting. As darkness fell, fire erupted in the auto parts store, and city fire crews rushed to control it. Protesters set other fires in the street. Officers could be seen surrounding the nearby precinct, not attempting to intervene in the looting. Police spokesman John Elder said officers responding to a reported stabbing near the protests found a man lying on the sidewalk with what turned out to be a bullet wound. The man was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Elder said a suspect was in custody but said the facts leading up to the shooting were “still being sorted out.” It was the second night of violent protest since the death of Floyd, whom police were seeking to arrest outside a Minneapolis grocery store on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. A bystander’s cellphone video showed an officer kneeling on Floyd ’s neck for almost eight minutes as he eventually became unresponsive. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted for calm early Thursday. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. He also asked for the public’s help in keeping the peace. The officer and three others were fired Tuesday, and on Wednesday, Frey called for him to be criminally charged. Protesters also gathered Wednesday evening at the officer’s suburban home as well as the Minneapolis home of Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County prosecutor who would make a charging decision in the case. No violence was reported in those protests. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said.

A racially-mixed group of more than 70 people rallied outside the precinct in Midtown Memphis then walked down Union Avenue on Wednesday night to protest the death of George Floyd. The situation intensified later in the night, with police donning riot gear and protesters standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of officers stationed behind a barricade. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and investigations are under way in Floyd’s death Monday. A white police officer is seen on video kneeling against the neck of Floyd, who was handcuffed and complained that he could not breathe. Standing behind metal barricades, the Memphis protesters held signs and chanted the names of other unarmed black men who have died in confrontations with police officers in the U.S. in recent years, such as Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Police wearing protective masks due to the new coronavirus outbreak stood in a line in the middle of the street in front of the precinct, facing the protesters. Behind the officers and another set of barricades, a white man held a sign that read “Police Lives Matter. Comply. Confederate 901.” The area code of Memphis is 901. Protesters later moved across the street, closer to the precinct and officers. One man with loudspeaker directed his words at a group of officers, saying “we’re here for justice.” They then walked away from the precinct, chanting “no justice, no peace.” Memphis saw its share of protests after the death of Darrius Stewart, a 19-year-old black man who was fatally shot by a white officer during a fight at a traffic stop in July 2015. A large protest erupted in the Memphis neighborhood of Frayser last June after U.S. Marshals fatally shot 20-year-old Brandon Webber 16 times while trying to arrest him on charges that he shot a man and stole his car. Investigators say Webber came out of his car holding a gun when he was shot. Some officers were injured when protesters threw bricks and bottles at them after the shooting, Memphis police said.",0.0

Before closing its doors due to the pandemic, the theater sold large bags of popcorn so customers could enjoy it at home. (Photo: Jim Davis/For the DNJ) As communities work to recover from this spring's COVID-19 closures, many of the hallmarks of summer could be left behind. With the threat of the coronavirus still making large gatherings taboo, businesses and communities are being forced to cancel or postpone events like concerts, festivals and other summertime celebrations. Many planners are holding off as long as possible for cancellations, while others are modifying events. And even if your favorite festival isn't going to happen, there are plenty of other offerings to keep your family entertained in Rutherford County. A virtual Secret Garden One of the first big events each summer is the Discovery Center Secret Garden Tour and Party, and it's one of the major fundraisers for the hands-on museum and environmental center. Due to concerns surrounding COVID-19, Discovery Center CEO Tara MacDougall wanted to protect patrons’ health and safety by moving everything to an online platform. “Our closure on March 16 had an immediate and significant impact on our earned income,"" MacDougall said. “As a nonprofit, Discovery Center does not have a large reserve."" So this year organizers are inviting patrons participate in a virtual “Secret Garden Party at Home” from 7-8 p.m. June 5. Tickets are $100 and can be purchased online at explorethedc.org. Once purchased, holders will receive access to the event hosted on the video streaming platform LunchPool. The event will feature storytelling by Kara Kemp and Kory Wells, a cooking demonstration by Mitchell Murphree of Five Senses Restaurant and Catering, and a discussion of best home gardening practices by Nina Hanson of Lascassas-based Hanson Farms. In lieu of the party’s signature cocktails and gourmet dining, the Discovery Center is partnering with Five Senses to provide a take-home menu of specially-created fare for the event. The Secret Garden Tour, which normally follows the weekend after the party, will also be featured online this year with virtual garden tours from Dr. and Mrs. Joe Little, Ran Powers, and Autumn Schultz. Tours can be viewed at no cost and will be shown on the event’s Facebook event page. Music festivals Main Street Murfreesboro's JazzFest for students in May was nixed and the Friday Night Live concert, held monthly the first Friday of the month, is canceled for June. ""We are going to wait each month and call it based on the governor's allowances with music events outside,"" said Sarah Callender, executive director for Main Street Murfreesboro. But plans for the much-anticipated JazzFest featuring national acts are still in the works, Callender said. Uncle Dave Macon Days: A Roots Rendezvous, traditionally held each July, was moved to the fall. But organizers have decided to cancel this year's event due to lack of funding from sponsors whose budgets are affected by COVID-19. To help musicians affected by concert cancellations, UDMD will be hosting online fundraisers at noon starting June 20 and broadcast on the festival's Facebook page. Fourth of July All is not lost for this year's Fourth of July celebrations. While Smyrna's event is canceled this year, events will continue in Murfreesboro, La Vergne and Rockvale. ""At this point we are still going to have our Fourth of July celebration with social distancing guidelines in place,"" said La Vergne spokeswoman Anne Smith. Although the festival-style activities won't be held at Murfreesboro's annual Celebration Under the Stars on July 4, there will be a large fireworks display, confirmed Parks and Rec Director Nate Williams. A location for the Murfreesboro fireworks display has yet to be determined. Buy Photo Amanda Burns looks over items for sale at the annual Rockvale picnic, held July 4, 2018.

""We know this year’s July 4 Picnic might be a little different from past events, but we hope the picnic will go off without a hitch,"" said Macon, a member of the Rockvale Ruritan Club, which sponsors the event. Macon said the picnic committee will revisit the plans June 1. ""We're waiting to see what the governor does. And a lot of our food vendors and participants are elderly people from the churches, so we are trying to get a read on that,"" said Macon, who suggested following the Rockvale Ruritan Club Facebook page to keep up with details. At the pool Outdoor summertime festivities and activities at SportsCom's Boro Beach in Murfreesboro are dead in the water, with no word when it will be open, said Parks and Rec Director Nate Williams. The SportsCom indoor pool is open for lap swim and exercise classes, but no open swim is allowed yet. Patterson Park Community Center pool remains closed because of renovations. Smyrna festivities ""The town of Smyrna continues to cancel and postpone events, as well as delay the opening of some facilities to ensure the safety of our citizens and adherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and Gov. Lee’s Tennessee Pledge,"" said Smyrna spokeswoman Kathy Ferrell. For larger events and festivals, cancellations were made early on because of so many moving parts, Ferrell said. Cancellations include: Simply Smyrna. The Smyrna Art Crawl. Fire and Police Youth Academy. Fourth of July Celebration. Smyrna Golf Course First Tee Summer Program. For now. Smyrna has postponed the Top Gun Night Run, which was slated for late May, and an alternate date has not been set. Modifications, delayed openings and programs are being evaluated on a daily basis. Openings for Smyrna Outdoor Adventure Center and Splash Town, as well as the Splash Pad at Gregory Mill Park, have been delayed. Programming for the months of June and July at SOAC are tentative, Ferrell said. Buy Photo Smyrna's Bark Springs at Sharp Springs Park is open. (Photo: HELEN COMER/DNJ) Residents can still enjoy many of the trails and green spaces at places like Gregory Mill Park, Sharp Springs Park, Bark Park and Captain Jeff Kuss Memorial. Recreational activities such as disc golf at Sharp Springs, tennis at Lee Victory Park and Smyrna Golf Course are open for use daily. Social distancing must be practiced, Ferrell noted. La Vergne On June 2, La Vergne Farmers Market will kick off at Bicentennial Park, 5093 Murfreesboro Road. The market will continue from 3-7 p.m. every Tuesday from June through September, and social distancing practices are required. To make up for the events that were canceled, the city will host a big celebration that combines a block party, Easter egg hunt and Movie in the Park on June 13. Eagleville Although Eagleville hasn't canceled any events for the year, town leaders are monitoring COVID-19 recommendations closely. For now, First Fridays activities are postponed but ""not off the table for the entire summer,"" said City Manager Hellyn Riggins. And plans are still under way for the fall festival. Theaters, museums While chain movie theaters like Malco and AMC remain closed, Murfreesboro's Premiere 6 opened May 22. ""Each week we will have new classics for you with staggered showtimes and limited seats to allow social distancing,"" said Premiere 6 owner Dave Gober. Tickets are $5 each and Gober suggested customers purchase ahead of time online at murfreesboromovies.com because seating will be limited to 25 seats at each showing. Each week's lineup will be posted online as well as the Premiere 6 Facebook page. Most cultural centers remain closed as well, including Center for the Arts, Discovery Center, Bradley Academy Museum and Cultural Center and Sam Davis Home. But many are offering online adaptations of activities. Murfreesboro Little Theatre, which has no permanent location, hosted a virtual production of ""Spoon River Anthology,"" bringing together nearly 50 people from across the United States to participate.

Beginning June 2, Oaklands Mansion will offer self-guided tours of the historic house during regular business hours. Visit oaklandsmansion.org/ for details and tickets. Daily history lessons and garden ""tours"" will continue to be posted on Facebook. Entertainment centers Entertainment centers throughout Rutherford County have opened to the public, although some are offering a limited number of activities. But there's plenty for families to do. Centers are operating at 50% capacity for social distancing purposes, staff members are wearing masks, plastic shields were installed around sales counters, and communal items are sanitized after each use. Each facility also has its own additional guidelines and services. Skate Center Smyrna reopens May 29 and Skate Center West in Murfreesboro will reopen soon as well, but a date has not been announced. Murfreesboro's Go USA Fun Park go-karts are now rolling and all other attractions, including batting cages, the arcade and mini-golf, are operating as well. During the closure, Lanes, Trains and Automobiles underwent a major remodel. But for now, bowling lanes are open and limited to 64 guests at a time. The arcade games and laser tag arenas are not open yet and the concessions will feature a limited menu for the time being. Although plans are moving forward for the new location for Murfreesboro Strike and Spare bowling lanes, t time frame for opening at the new facility is extended. So the current facility will remain open until a few weeks before moving begins. ► More: It's back to bowling in Rutherford County: Here's what you need to know Smyrna Bowling Center is no longer open 24 hours a day, but instead closes overnight for cleaning.

The situation began around 7:30 p.m. with protesters gathering on the sidewalk before moving into the street near the MPD Traffic Unit, blocking all lanes in the 1900 block of Union. Dozens of police cruisers arrived for crowd control. At least three people were taken into custody. Wednesday night’s protest was sparked by recent events, including the death of George Floyd who died after an encounter with a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

They chanted for justice in Memphis. They stopped freeway traffic in Los Angeles. The death of George Floyd continued to ripple across the U.S. on Wednesday night as the calls became louder for the arrest of the white police officer who knelt on his neck for several minutes in a horrifying video that spread across social media this week. Meanwhile on Thursday, Ben Crump, attorney for Floyd's family, warned any instigators of violence in the Minneapolis protests: ""We don't need that. We need people focused on getting justice,"" he said. He is calling for an independent autopsy, saying he doesn't trust the city of Minneapolis. ""They offered him no humanity while keeping his knee on his neck. Members of the public were the only ones trying to de-escalate the situation. Not the police,"" Crump told CNN on Thursday. ""Keeping the knee on the neck for over 8 minutes – that is unconscionable."" While hundreds of protesters took to the streets, police chiefs from coast to coast expressed their outrage with Floyd's death. ""Do not defend the undefendable, attempt to justify the unjustifiable or excuse the inexcusable,"" Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina said on Twitter. ""George Floyd should be alive today."" ""The lack of compassion, use of excessive force, or going beyond the scope of the law, doesn't just tarnish our badge – it tears at the very fabric of race relations in this country,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said in a statement posted to Twitter. Minneapolis: Police, protesters clash; looters raid Target, Dollar Tree, other stores Protests in Minneapolis devolved into chaos on Wednesday night. Reports of fires came from around the city and videos of looters inside of stores quickly spread on social media. Several people shared video of people taking products from a local Target. A Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an AutoZone store also showed signs of damage and looting, and windows of businesses in nearby strip malls were reported to be smashed out. At least one person was killed. Police spokesman John Elder told USA TODAY that the department was investigating a homicide near the area where a reporter from the Star Tribune newspaper tweeted that a looter had been shot and killed by a pawn shop owner. One person was in custody early Thursday, the Star Tribune reported, but police wouldn't confirm if the victim was a looter. “The facts of what led up to the shooting are still being sorted out. We are truly in the infancy of this investigation,” Elder said. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Memphis: George Floyd's death was 'nail in the unfortunate coffin for America' A silent demonstration to protest the death of Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, turned into verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters. The rally began with about 40 people holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop killing black people” and “Silence is violence.” Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice, no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up. Within an hour, however, the protesters were met by two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. Theryn C. Bond, a prominent local activist and former Memphis City Council candidate, confronted the counter-protesters, who occasionally jeered at the crowd to ""go out for a jog"" — a reference to Aubrey's slaying. ""I was so impressed to see so many white allies,"" Bond said. ""Because sometimes we think, 'Everybody doesn't get it.' And I think with the recent murder of George Floyd by police... I think this was the proverbial nail in the unfortunate coffin for America to really understand what we mean when we say, 'Black Lives Matter.'"" Floyd's death this week is the latest in a string of violence against black people. Taylor was shot and killed in her Kentucky home by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant, while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect.

Taylor was shot and killed in her Kentucky home by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant, while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect. Los Angeles: Protesters block 101 freeway, smash windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers Hundreds of people protesting Floyd's death while in police custody blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers in a rally organized by Black Lives Matter. Demonstrators gathered in the late afternoon on downtown streets and, eventually, dozens of them moved onto U.S. 101 despite police efforts to keep them from walking into the lanes. When a CHP patrol car arrived, demonstrators surrounded it. The car's window was smashed and it jerked forward and moved away with several protesters who had jumped onto the hood. Television news footage showed one man finally hopping or jumping from the side of the moving car and then flopping onto the ground. A second CHP car arrived and was attacked, with one demonstrator hurling what appeared to be a wooden skateboard through the back window before it moved off. At its rally's peak, hundreds of people gathered outside the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice. The demonstration was mostly peaceful and no arrests were immediately made, Los Angeles police Officer Mike Lopez said. Contributing: Corinne S. Kennedy, Micaela A.

More on what happened next in a moment, but first... Shelby County reported the most novel coronavirus deaths in a single day yesterday, pushing the county's death toll above 100 — and fueling worries about a potential surge. The eight deaths reported yesterday, a week and a half after the launch of Phase 2 of the local ""Back to Business"" reopening plan, brought the county's count of COVID-19 fatalities up to 102, our Micaela Watts and Sam Hardiman report. This morning, the number of deaths rose to 105, with 122 new cases. Meanwhile, the nation also passed a grim milestone on Wednesday, reporting more than 100,000 total COVID-19 deaths. But wait — there's more. Buy Photo Darrance Stokes (left) sits six feet away from service advisor Chad Willits as they fill out paperwork in the service drive Thursday, May 14, 2020, at Cadillac of Memphis. (Photo: Max Gersh / The Commercial Appeal) Public health officials are ""nervously eyeing cities that may become the next epicenters of the coronavirus pandemic,"" The Hill reported yesterday. And of those cities that are being eyed, nervously, Memphis and Nashville were listed as two prominent examples: While the number of new coronavirus cases is declining in New York, Seattle and other focal points of the first wave of cases, models are predicting that cases could skyrocket in the next two weeks in cities like Houston, Dallas, Nashville, Tenn., and Memphis, Tenn., creating new epicenters. ... In Nashville and Memphis, slackening social distancing practices are likely to mean those cities will experience more than 100 new cases a day by next week. Those projections are based on the model from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, which takes social distancing, climate and population density into account. Shelby County's social distancing is currently estimated at 34%. Earlier this month, Dr. David Rubin, who leads the team behind the model, described Tennessee's pandemic as a slow burning fire, per our Sam Hardiman. Rubin credited Memphis' lower case count and hospitalization rates in Memphis to the region's climate, population density and social distancing, and warned that a surge could come later this year as temperatures cool. But, as The Hill pointed out, cooling attitudes toward social distancing over the holiday weekend might move that timetable up. So, what's next? The county's second phase will last at least another week and a half, at which point local officials will decide whether to enter Phase 3 of the reopening plan. They should probably hold off at least another week, based on the latest models. Whenever the county does decide to enter Phase 3, not a lot would change except that capacity limits in most categories would be raised to 75% and more than 50 people could be allowed to meet, depending on the venue and its social distancing plan. Speaking of reopening Memphis... The Commercial Appeal just launched a new series, ""Rebuilding America,"" that aims to provide a comprehensive view of what the reopening looks like here in Memphis. Our executive editor, Mark Russell, has more about the purpose of the series. But here's a list of what the reopening looks like for... Protesters clash on Union in Midtown After a recent rash of high-profile slayings of black people across the country, a large crowd demonstrated last night in Midtown, resulting in the closure of Union Avenue. It was already an emotional night as the protesters mourned the deaths of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer handcuffed him and pinned him to the ground with a knee on his neck; of Breonna Taylor was shot and killed by police inside her apartment in Kentucky as police executed a ""no-knock"" search warrant; and of Ahmaud Arbery, who was chased, shot and killed while jogging in Georgia. But then Confederate 901 showed up. To refresh your memory, Confederate 901 is a group that organized a series of protests a couple of years ago against the removal of Memphis' Confederate monuments. The two members who showed up last night started telling black protesters to ""go out for a jog"" — a despicable, racist threat referencing the shooting of Arbery. Our story — by Corinne Kennedy, Micaela Watts and Sam Hardiman — walks through everything that happened last night in chronological order, so be sure to read that. Here's a video (with explicit language, just to warn you) of scenes from the night: CLOSE Protestors lead to a shut down of Union Avenue in Midtown, clashes with anti-protestors and police. *Explicit language some viewers may find offensive Memphis Commercial Appeal The morning after, what's getting the most attention is probably this exchange (part of which was shown in the above video) between a deputy chief and activist Theryn Bond: At about 10:15 p.m., MPD Deputy Chief Samuel Hines sought a dialogue with protesters. He listened as Bond described what she felt was unfair treatment from police officers at the scene. After Bond said her piece, Hines asked the protesters if they would show the same enthusiasm and outrage for ""those individuals, those victims, those fathers, those sons and brothers that were killed,"" in reference to the homicides that occurred in Memphis over the weekend. Of course, Hines was right: Memphis should be angry about the rampant violence in its streets. But a demonstration against the callous disregard for black lives on a national scale isn't the time or place for making that point. People can and should be angry about both. ""This is not the conversation for that,"" as one protester said in the above video.

A Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an AutoZone store also showed signs of damage and looting, and windows of businesses in nearby strip malls were reported to be smashed out.

Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up.

Protesters rallied for more than five hours, at times chanting and marching up and down sections of Union Ave. near the area’s police precinct. Earlier in the night, officers temporarily closed a section of the typically busy street and later confined protesters to the Walgreens’ parking lot on Union and McLean Blvd. At one point, protesters blocked east-bound traffic as they marched with signs reading: “Black Lives Matter” and “Say His Name, George Floyd.” It started as a peaceful show of solidarity for Floyd, the Minnesota man who died after being detained by police. A video recording showed an officer kneeling on his neck as he pleaded for air. Other people were also on protesters’ minds—Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Breoona Taylor in Kentucky, two additional recent African American deaths that have sparked national anger. Speaking through a megaphone, Devante Hill, a pastor at One Church Memphis, noted the diversity of the crowd. “Tonight we are in solidarity,” he said. “Our black brothers and our white brothers are joining forces, and we are going to stand against injustice.” The protest grew more tense as the night wore on. A steady stream of chants included, “Hands up, don’t shoot” and “No justice, no peace.” At one point, the crowd knelt in the middle of Union Ave. with their hands in the air as police blocked their path. Police restrained at least one protester as they began dispersing the crowd. Other media outlets reported two arrests. Some officers eventually donned riot helmets and shields. After warning the crowd to remove themselves from the street, police forced them off of Union and established a barricade in the Walgreens’ parking lot. A helicopter, believed to belong to authorities, hovered overhead well past midnight. Demonstrator Rico Fields, 31, said as a black man he constantly fears he’ll be treated unfairly by law enforcement. “The lack of self-accountability is why we’re out here,” he said. “If the police could handle their own people, there would be no protests.” Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland said in a statement that he and Police Director Mike Rallings shared demonstrators' ""frustation with what happened in Minneapolis and other parts of the country."" ""It's right and understandable for people to express their frustration through peaceful protest; however I wish last night's protesters would have had on all masks, been six feet apart, and gone through the proper channels to ensure everyone's safety,"" the statement reads.

Asked to confirm reports that he had been shot by a store owner, police spokesman John Elder said that was “one of the theories.” Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon Wednesday near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old George Floyd died on Memorial Day after an officer knelt on his neck until he became unresponsive. Protesters skirmished with officers, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas in a repeat of Tuesday night’s confrontation. On Thursday morning, smoke hung over Minneapolis and looters carried merchandise from a damaged Target store with no interference by police. Video of the store’s interior showed empty clothing racks and shelves and debris strewn about. Obscenities were spray painted on the exterior of the store. Protests spread to other U.S. cities. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers on Wednesday. It was the second night of violent protest in Minneapolis since the death of Floyd, whom police were seeking to arrest outside a Minneapolis grocery store on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. A bystander’s cellphone video showed an officer kneeling on Floyd ‘s neck for almost eight minutes as he eventually became unresponsive. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted for calm early Thursday. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. He also asked for the public’s help in keeping the peace. The officer and three others were fired Tuesday, and on Wednesday, Frey called for him to be criminally charged. Frey asked Gov. Tim Walz to activate the National Guard, a spokesman confirmed Thursday. The governor’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Walz tweeted for calm Wednesday night, calling the violence “an extremely dangerous situation” and urging people to leave the scene. On Wednesday night, officers responding to a reported stabbing near the protests found a man lying on the sidewalk with what turned out to be a bullet wound, Elder said. The man was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Elder said a suspect was in custody but said the facts leading up to the shooting were “still being sorted out.”",0.0

Standing behind metal barricades, the Memphis protesters held signs and chanted the names of other unarmed black men who have died in confrontations with police officers in the U.S. in recent years, such as Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Police wearing protective masks due to the new coronavirus outbreak stood in a line in the middle of the street in front of the precinct, facing the protesters. Behind the officers and another set of barricades, a white man held a sign that read “Police Lives Matter. Comply. Confederate 901.” The area code of Memphis is 901. Protesters later moved across the street, closer to the precinct and officers. One man with loudspeaker directed his words at a group of officers, saying “we’re here for justice.” They then walked away from the precinct, chanting “no justice, no peace.” Memphis saw its share of protests after the death of Darrius Stewart, a 19-year-old black man who was fatally shot by a white officer during a fight at a traffic stop in July 2015. A large protest erupted in the Memphis neighborhood of Frayser last June after U.S. Marshals fatally shot 20-year-old Brandon Webber 16 times while trying to arrest him on charges that he shot a man and stole his car. Investigators say Webber came out of his car holding a gun when he was shot. Some officers were injured when protesters threw bricks and bottles at them after the shooting, Memphis police said.",0.0

Police Director Mike Rallings shares your frustration, and so do all the true police officers — men and women who put on the uniform every day to protect and serve. All cities and police departments have a responsibility to protect citizens from harm and to fight crime. But all of us — city governments, police departments, and the public — should expect police to protect and serve in a way that is responsible. It’s right and understandable for people to express their frustration through peaceful protest; however, I wish last night’s protesters would have all had on masks, been six feet apart, and gone through the proper channels to ensure everyone’s safety.

At least five protesters were arrested as a result of the demonstration.   The protest in Memphis was one of a few around the country.

Tre Black, 19, said they gathered on Union Avenue to express their right to protest after watching the video of Floyd just moments before his death. Black said the only thing they wanted was to be heard. “We can do better, and we’re not doing better, and that’s something that’s very frustrating to me,” said Black, who was among the people detained at the protest. Black said things quickly turned hostile once counter-protesters arrived. “That was the first sign that things weren’t going to go right,” Black said. In efforts to separate the crowd, police used barricades. “We were afraid that they were going to use a chemical agent,” Black said. Black decided to sit down, saying officers repeatedly told him to get up, but he refused and was detained. But Black, who has never been arrested, was soon let go. “That officer was kind of enough to let me go without incident; some other people weren’t so lucky,” Black said. Four protesters were arrested and charged with obstructing Union Avenue. Katherine Pace, 21, was also arrested and charged with assaulting an officer. Black said this was never the intention of the protest, and protesters only wanted their message to be heard. “I think when the police said it’s time to disperse, and it was an order, people were like, no, we need to be heard,” Black said. Many of those arrested are still in jail and being held without bond. The Memphis Police Department said in a statement it respects and welcomes the expression of the public’s First Amendment rights to all law-abiding citizens; however, it’s the department’s job to provide public safety. “The level of force and the disregard of life that was shown sicken me,” Memphis Police Director Michael Rallings said of Floyd’s death. “I understand the frustration that many are feeling, and I, too, believe that this incident should be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted by authorities.” Rallings also defended his department’s actions Wednesday. “They will not allow any disruptions in business, school, government and everyday function of life and liberty by unruly protesters or unlawful protest,” Rallings said. Rallings went on to say in his statement he understands protesters want to be heard, but they cannot block roadways, assault officers or disrupt others within the community. Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland also spoke out about the protest and the events in Minnesota. “I understand and share your frustration with what happened in Minneapolis and other parts of the country; police director Mike Rallings shares your frustration,” Strickland said. “However, I wish last night’s protesters would have all had on masks, been six feet apart and gone through the proper channel to ensure everyone’s safety because by not doing that they endanger their fellow demonstrators and the police officers who responded.”",0.0

1619468339,2020-05-28 17:46:03,FBI giving top priority to black man’s death at hands of Minneapolis police,https://www.laprensalatina.com/fbi-giving-top-priority-to-black-mans-death-at-hands-of-minneapolis-police/,en,False,,287422,laprensalatina.com,http://laprensalatina.com/,"Washington, May 28 (efe-epa).- The US Department of Justice and the FBI on Thursday issued a joint statement saying that they will undertake a “robust criminal investigation” into the death of an African American man at the hands of Minneapolis police, adding that the matter will be considered “a top priority.” The investigation into the death of 46-year-old George Floyd while he was handcuffed and pinned to the ground by a police officer during his arrest on May 25 was announced after violent protests in the Minnesota capital over the past two nights. “The Department of Justice has made the investigation a top priority and has assigned experienced prosecutors and FBI criminal investigators to the matter,” said US attorney in Minneapolis Erica MacDonald and FBI Special Agent Rainer Drolshagen, who is in charge of the bureau’s Minneapolis field office, in a joint statement. The Justice Department and other law enforcement officials said that they are delving into whether any of the four former police officers involved – all of whom were fired on May 26 after the incident became public with the posting on the social networks of a shocking cellphone video of the incident – had violated federal law. Floyd’s death has revived a national debate about excessive police violence against the country’s African American citizens. The FBI investigation into the matter will assemble witness statements and other evidence before the US attorney’s office considers whether to pursue federal charges against any of the officers. To gain a conviction on civil rights charges in the case, prosecutors would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers willfully acted to deprive Floyd of his constitutional rights. Meanwhile, the investigators called on the public for “calm” as they conduct their probe. After receiving a complaint, reportedly that a man might be trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill at a local store, officers arrived on the scene on Monday and found Floyd sitting in his vehicle, and when they ordered him to get out they said he resisted arrest, adding in their official report filed after the incident that after they had handcuffed him and made him lie facedown on the pavement they noticed that he was in “medical distress.” In the video taken by a passerby of Floyd’s arrest and the events leading to his death, the black man is seen lying facedown on the pavement beside a patrol car with one of the officers kneeling on the back of his neck for more than five minutes without changing position, despite the fact that Floyd can be heard saying that he cannot breathe and begging for the officers not to hurt him until he ultimately loses consciousness. “Please, please, please I can’t breathe,” and “My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Please, please. I can’t breathe,” Floyd is heard saying, but the officer never reduced the pressure of his knee and body weight on the man’s neck until an ambulance arrived minutes later and Floyd was loaded onto a stretcher showing no signs of life. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. At a press conference on Tuesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey described the incident as “completely and utterly messed up.” “I believe what I saw and what I saw is wrong on every level,” Frey said, adding that “Being black in America should not be a death sentence.” “When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help, and this officer failed in the most basic human sense,” Frey added. Frey said on Thursday in an interview with CBS that Floyd would be alive today if he had been white, adding definitively that the arresting officer had killed him. On Wednesday night, clashes and looting erupted in Minneapolis, with rising calls for the arrest of the officer directly responsible for Floyd’s death. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, thousands of people took to the streets of the Minnesota capital for the second consecutive day and night to stage a series of protests that targeted the homes of the police officer who asphyxiated Floyd and the county prosecutor, and those protests became more and more violent as the night wore on. The protests also included clashes with police, who fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators at several spots around the city, as well as the looting of a Target department store, a Foot Locker and a liquor store, and the burning of an auto parts store, among other incidents. A pawn shop owner shot one person, who died at a local hospital, police told local media. Another group of protesters headed for the home of the officer who had knelt on Floyd’s neck – Derek Chauvin – pouring red paint on his driveway and writing “Killer” on his garage door before riot police disbursed them.",0.0

Bill Lee's COVID-19 press briefing he spoke on recent incidents of police brutality around the country. Nashville Tennessean Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect comments from U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said Thursday the former Minnesota police officers involved in the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis on Monday, ""should be brought to justice for the loss of that life."" During his weekly COVID-19 news conference, Lee, a Tennessee Republican, condemned police brutality and said he spoke about the issue with leaders of Tennessee's African American community as well as law enforcement. He did not specify who was part of those conversations. His remarks came after a week of protests across the U.S. about the deaths of black Americans, including a demonstration in Memphis Wednesday evening that lasted into the wee hours of Thursday morning. Throughout the day Friday, other leaders also voiced their disgust over Floyd's death. ""In our conversations, we all agreed that the situation there represents a very disturbing trend across the country ... and that we have to be committed to recognizing and calling out police brutality where it exists,"" Lee said. ""I have a great deal of respect for and have long supported law enforcement and continue to do so ... but police brutality is not law enforcement."" Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin pins George Floyd to the ground on May 25. Floyd later died. Chauvin was fired the next day. (Photo: Darnella Frazier via Storyful) ""Police brutality should not be accepted in this state and it shouldn't be tolerated,"" Lee continued. ""I don't believe we should or will tolerate it in the days ahead. It's unacceptable."" The governor did not address the protest in Memphis specifically. That protest, which at its peak attracted more than 100 protesters and Memphis police in riot gear, blocked traffic on Union Avenue in Midtown Memphis for hours. It came the same night that some of the widespread protests in Minneapolis ended in violence and property damage. George Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. (Photo: Photo courtesy of the Floyd family) Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland also condemned the actions of the four officers involved in Minneapolis on Thursday and said ""all true police officers"" felt the same. He also criticized the protesters for not observing social distancing during a pandemic, saying they put themselves and Memphis Police Department personnel at risk of contracting COVID-19. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for Derek Chauvin, the former officer who knelt on Floyd's neck as the man cried out for breath, to be arrested, according the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. On Friday, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen expressed his disgust for how Floyd died and said the United States needs to change and that Congress should act. ""Congress must act to address the unfair treatment of African Americans in their interactions with police,"" Cohen said. ""The recent outrageous mishandling of the Ahmaud Arbery murder case in Georgia, the police shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville and the videotaped asphyxiation of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer are just the most recent examples of an injustice African Americans have endured for centuries.

(Photo: Joe Rondone/The Commercial Appeal) An earlier of this story incorrectly identified the person who recorded the video mentioned below. The video was recorded by Kimberly Dollar. A Wednesday evening protest over police brutality and the deaths of black Americans ended with at least five of the demonstrators being arrested. In the aftermath, activists, community leaders and the Shelby County Democratic Party criticized the Memphis Police Department and Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland. Activists and elected officials questioned why the MPD allowed two counter-protesters to use racial slurs (epithets were also hurled at police), and why three of those arrested were still in the Shelby County Jail on misdemeanor charges when the site is among the known outbreaks of COVID-19 in Shelby County. They also said they don’t feel that police are listening to them. ""People in Memphis do not feel they are being heard,"" said Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer during a virtual news conference Thursday. Sawyer and State Rep. G.A. Hardaway of Memphis criticized the actions of several MPD personnel on Wednesday evening and early Thursday morning during the protest that shutdown Union Avenue in Midtown Memphis for hours. Other participants in the virtual news conference included the Rev. Earle Fisher; educator Ayo Akinmoladun, who organized the Wednesday protest; activist Keedran Franklin; community organizer Theryn Bond; and local Black Lives Matter organizer Shahidah Jones. Sawyer and Strickland opposed each other in the October municipal election and embarked upon what was a tough campaign. There is also no love lost between the city of Memphis administration and some activists. ""They (police officers) were out of line last night, and I'm being kind when I say that,"" said Hardaway, who did not attend the protest, noting a moment when a member of MPD used a riot shield and knocked a woman over. Video footage, originally captured by protester Kimberly Dollar and circulated by activist Hunter Demster, showed a woman standing on Union Avenue when she was approached by an MPD officer with a riot shield who knocked her to the ground with the shield. In a statement and public comments Thursday, Strickland also expressed outrage at the deaths of black Americans, particularly the death of George Floyd Monday. But the mayor criticized the lack of social distancing, saying it put the protesters and MPD personnel at risk for contracting the virus. CLOSE Protestors lead to a shut down of Union Avenue in Midtown, clashes with anti-protestors and police. *Explicit language some viewers may find offensive Memphis Commercial Appeal The protest, which lasted for hours, came at a time when groups of more than 50 are forbidden in Memphis and Shelby County unless there's a clear social distancing plan. The group also expressed concern about Strickland’s criticism of protesters for forgoing social distancing guidelines and placing themselves and the police at risk of COVID-19. Akinmoladun, one of the organizers, said the demonstration started with observation of social distancing guidelines. What started out as a spaced-out, silent protest turned into a crowd as tensions flared between protesters and counter-protesters as well as police. MPD later used barricades to keep protesters on the north sidewalk of Union Avenue, which, momentarily, put them in a more confined space than the blocked-off street. The protesters were free to move about, however, and they later marched east and west down Union Avenue. After 10 p.m. Wednesday, the main body of protesters returned to an area east of Walgreens at Union and McLean Boulevard, a crowd of more than 50 gathered around MPD Deputy Chief Sam Hines. Some in the crowd were wearing masks. Others were not. After the crowded confrontation between Bond and Hines, the MPD Deputy Chief motioned for dozens of officers to back away from the crowd in an apparent attempt to deescalate the conflict. Some time later, police returned in riot gear. MPD officers were also seen throughout the evening standing shoulder to shoulder. Both protesters and police convened in small groups, standing next to each other. Most MPD personnel on the scene wore masks, but more than a few did not wear anything covering their mouths or noses. Strickland’s criticism over the lack of social distancing was, in turn, critiqued by the Shelby County Democratic Party. “In response to Mayor Strickland’s statement released this morning, the Party takes the following position: the Memphis Police Department unnecessarily placed themselves, their colleagues, and the protesters at risk — not the other way around, as the Mayor stated,” the party said in a statement. The party said, “During a global pandemic, officers refusing to maintain at least six feet between themselves and protesters, unless absolutely critical to do otherwise unnecessarily places citizens at risk. Refusing to maintain that distance while not wearing a mask or gloves increases risk, and setting up barricades, making it impossible for many protesters to maintain six feet apart, unnecessarily places citizens at risk.” MPD and Attorney General Amy Weirich did not respond to a request for comment. The Strickland administration refused to comment beyond his statements and comments Thursday. Two of at least five people arrested due to the protest were released on their recognizance.

The station has become the site of an ongoing protest after the police killing of George Floyd. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired after a video taken by a bystander was posted on social media showing Floyd’s neck being pinned to the ground by an officer as he repeatedly said, “I can’t breathe”. Floyd was later pronounced dead while in police custody after being transported to Hennepin County Medical Center. (Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called in the National Guard on Thursday as looting broke out in St. Paul and a wounded Minneapolis braced for more violence after rioting over the death of a handcuffed black man in police custody reduced parts of one neighborhood to a smoking shambles. The Minneapolis unrest ravaged several blocks in the Longfellow neighborhood, with scattered rioting reaching for miles across the city. It was the second consecutive night of violent protests following the death of George Floyd, who gasped for breath during a Monday arrest in which an officer kneeled on his neck for almost eight minutes. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd can be heard pleading that he can’t breathe until he slowly stops talking and moving. Another protest was announced for Thursday evening near county offices in downtown Minneapolis. Some stores in Minneapolis and the suburbs closed early, fearing more strife. The city shut down its light-rail system and planned to stop all bus service out of safety concerns. Around midday Thursday, the violence spread a few miles away to a Target in St. Paul’s Midway neighborhood, where police said 50 to 60 people rushed the store attempting to loot it. Police and state patrol squad cars later blocked the entrance, but the looting then shifted to shops along nearby University Avenue, one of St. Paul’s main commercial corridors, and other spots in the city. St. Paul spokesman Steve Linders said authorities have been dealing with unrest in roughly 20 different areas throughout the city. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again. We can all be in that fight together,” St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter tweeted. Walz called for widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect. George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction,” Walz said. By Thursday morning in Minneapolis, smoke rose from smoldering buildings in the Longfellow neighborhood, scene of the worst violence. In a strip mall across the street from the police’s 3rd Precinct station, the focus of the previous night’s protests, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. But others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence: “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage or looting. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. Protests also spread to other U.S. cities. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Memphis police blocked a main thoroughfare after a racially mixed group of protesters gathered outside a police precinct. The situation intensified later in the night, with police donning riot gear and protesters standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of officers stationed behind a barricade. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. There was no sign of police at the destroyed shopping center, though a couple dozen were outside the precinct house. One man standing outside the building was using a bullhorn to shout. “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe. Mama, I can’t breathe,” repeating some of Floyd’s pleas for relief. Across from the precinct, someone had spray-painted the sidewalk in red: “Where’s humanity?” The 46-year-old Floyd died as police arrested him outside a convenience store after a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death and making the case a priority. The announcement came a day after President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating, with a probe focused on whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. The officer who kneeled on Floyd and three others were fired Tuesday. The next day, the mayor called for him to be criminally charged. Frey appealed to Gov. Tim Walz to activate the National Guard, a spokesman confirmed Thursday. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Walz tweeted for calm Wednesday night, calling the violence “an extremely dangerous situation” and urging people to leave the scene. The last time the Minnesota National Guard was called out to deal with civil unrest was in a backup role during the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul. The most comparable situation to the current disturbances happened when the Guard was called up to deal with the riots in Minneapolis in 1967, a summer when anger over racial inequalities came to a boil in many cities across the country. The Minnesota National Guard was also called out during protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and early 1970s and during a 1986 strike by Hormel meatpackers in Austin.",0.0

Police are working to identify the officer involved. Police Director Michael Rallings will not comment on an ongoing investigation. ***** MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A piece of video from Wednesday’s protest in Memphis is causing a big stir. The video seems to show an officer knocking down a woman who was standing near demonstrators at the Midtown police precinct on Union Avenue. The video is short, but what it shows had plenty of people talking. In the video, you can see what appears to be officers in riot gear, and to their left is a woman standing nearby. One of the officers appears to take a swing and knock the woman to the ground. Hunter Demster, a well-known activist in Memphis, said he took the video during last night’s protest in Memphis. WREG doesn’t know who the woman is, what prompted the officer’s actions or how she is doing, but people who have seen the video want to know. When Demster posted the video on his Facebook page, it set off a firestorm of comments with people saying it was horrific and awful. Some even asked if the officer is going to lose his job. In his regular COVID-19 briefing Thursday, Mayor Jim Strickland did not address the video specifically, and WREG doesn’t know if he has even seen it. But after expressing anger over the video from Minneapolis, he did say the following about Memphis’ protest. “I want to say how proud I am of Memphis police officers and those officers on the scene last night,” Strickland said. “I thought they handled themselves well.” Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer saw the video and posted a message to city leadership to respond. She hosted a Zoom press conference Thursday afternoon. “I am really disappointed in the mayor of Memphis’ response to this demonstration,” Sawyer said. “There is live video footage of a woman being knocked down off her feet with plexiglass by the Memphis Police Department. The idea of police brutality and abusing their power. I couldn’t go up to somebody and push them down like that. I would get in trouble for it.” WREG asked Demster to talk about what he witnessed Wednesday night, but he said he could not talk about it right now, as the protest organizers have declared a media blackout and are working on a prepared statement.",0.0

The mayor asked the governor to activate the National Guard. The protests that began late Wednesday and stretched into Thursday morning were the most destructive yet since the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video gasping for breath during an arrest in which an officer kneeled on his neck for almost eight minutes. In the footage, Floyd pleads that he cannot breathe and slowly stops talking and moving. Mayor Jacob Frey sought calm. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. Protests also spread to other U.S. cities.

Minneapolis police said the violence contrasted sharply with a mostly peaceful demonstration Tuesday afternoon at the street corner where Floyd died. “They were chanting for things to remain peaceful,” police spokesman John Elder said. “Tonight didn’t have the same feel. And that’s sad.” Pockets of looting continued Thursday. A liquor store employee displayed a gun as he stood among the debris of broken bottles and beer cans inside the business. Amid the violence, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. Firefighters were still spraying water onto hot buildings Thursday morning, and some buildings still smoldered, sending a bitter smell into the smoke-filled air. Windows were smashed out of several businesses in a strip mall, including a department store, a charter school and other businesses, and the destruction was visible for blocks. A Wendy’s restaurant was damaged beyond recognition. Inside some of the stores, shelves were toppled and debris strewn about. Video taken inside a damaged Target that had been looted showed empty clothing racks. Obscenities were spray-painted on the outside of the store. Streets and parking lots were also covered in debris, and many businesses had been spray-painted. There was no sign of a police presence, except around the precinct building, where officers were in riot gear. One man standing outside the building was using a bullhorn to shout. “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe. Mama, I can’t breathe,” repeating some of Floyd’s pleas for relief. Across from the precinct, someone had spray-painted the sidewalk in red: “Where’s humanity?” Protesters began gathering Wednesday afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city, where the 46-year-old Floyd died on Memorial Day as police arrested him outside a convenience store on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. Demonstrators also skirmished with officers, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas in a repeat of Tuesday night’s confrontation. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into Floyd’s death and making the case a priority.

Ajanaku and Dr. Sybil C. Mitchell — “If you want protests to stop, stop the injustice,” said the Rev. Dr. Earle J. Fisher. “Protests are the response to the injustice. So, as long as there is injustice, you can expect protests.” Fisher, senior pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Whitehaven and founder of #UpTheVote901, made that statement in response to a question posed on a video press conference hosted by Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer on Thursday. The press conference followed Wednesday’s downtown demonstration staged as a show of solidarity with and support for the family of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minn. The 46-year-old African-American man died on Monday after being subjected to a police choke hold during an encounter captured on a chilling video that has sparked waves of anger and protests through much of the nation. The Memphis demonstration was organized by local educator Ayo Akinmoladun as a silent protest following Centers for Disease Control guidelines for restricting the spread of the coronavirus. It started out that way, however, the scene then devolved into a confrontation when counter-protesters showed up brandishing signs, one of which read “Police Lives Matter … Comply…Confederate 901.” Memphis Police Department officers made moves to keep the groups apart, subsequently issuing dispersal orders in response to streets being blocked illegally, according to a police narrative. Five arrests were made, including a 21-year-old woman charged with assaulting an officer – an accusation vehemently rejected by protesters, some of whom pointed to police knocking a woman down in the street with plexiglass. Later on a social media, Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland posted this: “I’m proud of the Memphis Police Department and the way our officers conducted themselves last night.” During Thursday’s COVID-19 media briefing, Strickland said he understood “why people are angry and sad and frustrated that these things seem to occur over and over. …People have the right to peacefully protest, and we support that wholeheartedly.” Sawyer punctuated the press conference with her own list of demands, beginning with Strickland addressing “the use of “excessive force.” “Stop treating us as dangerous; stop treating us as the enemy,” Sawyer said, wrapping up the hour-plus long video conference. “This city is more than 60 percent black and the majority of us are black and poor and disenfranchised. “We’re not going to take it anymore, elected or not, reverends or not, teachers or not. We are not going to take it.” Additionally, Sawyer called for a reprimand of officers and the guiding of MPD Director Mike Rallings to “make sure there is an empathetic response…when these protests spill into the streets.” Other demands: drop all charges against protesters and “an apology for how you show up when black people show their pain in one of the only free forums that we have, the streets of Memphis.” In a statement issued after Wednesday’s encounter, Rallings said, “My thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Mr. George Floyd. There is no explanation for what we witnessed in Minneapolis. The level of force and the disregard of life that was shown sicken me.” Adding that he supports “the expression of the First Amendment right,” Rallings said, “law and order must be maintained for the safety of all citizens. Protesters cannot block roadways, assault officers, or disrupt others within our community.” MPD’s goal is “to continue to respond professionally and provide protection and order for all citizens,” said Rallings. Akinmoladun said he and 30 to 40 other educators involved assembled to have a silent protest, noting that he wished there was more he could do for Floyd’s family. “I know some folks thought we probably were going to shut down the bridge, shut down the highway. That wasn’t the intention. The intention was to stand in solidarity and show that we support George Floyd’s family. … “The intention of the protests was for all races – whites, blacks, latinos – to come together, honor George Floyd, honor the black kings and queens that continue to die to police brutality….And an arrest to be made for the officer that killed George Floyd.” Floyd’s deadly encounter with the Minneapolis police came after he reportedly attempted to make a purchase with what employees in a small store determined was a fake $20 bill. Floyd left out of the store and sat outside up against a wall. The police were called and Floyd was arrested. The store owner said he never saw Floyd resist arrest. Store video was turned over to authorities. At least one other video has surfaced and it shows no sign of Floyd resisting arrest. The four officers who responded to the call were immediately fired and their names released to the public. Floyd’s family, the city’s mayor and others are calling for the arrest of Derek Chauvin, the 19-year veteran officer who kept his knee against Floyd’s neck until he lost consciousness. Floyd, who could be heard saying he could not breathe and that he was dying, had no pulse and did not respond on the street as paramedics worked to revive him. Since then, the area where the incident unfolded has been then scene of multiple protests. And then came violence and looting. For many, including demonstrators in Memphis, Chauvin’s arrest cannot come soon enough. “We are demanding his arrest right now,” said Akinmoladun, calling for the dismantling of institutional racism. “The criminal justice system needs to change now.” (UPDATE: Chauvin was arrested on Friday.) Fisher put Floyd’s death in the context of the high-profile killings of other African Americans, including Ahmaud Arberry and Breonna Taylor. Then, said Fisher, “There are names in Memphis of people who have been killed and brutalized by Memphis Police Department. We stand in solidarity in the spirit of the most recent name.” Rep. G. A. Hardaway added what he called “this reminder…for all black people, brown people, those of little means, those of no means: “If you are oppressed and you ask permission from the oppressor for when, where, how to fight for your freedom, you will never be free.”",0.0
1619619174,2020-05-28 22:46:03,George Floyd death protests spread to streets of New York City,https://www.laprensalatina.com/george-floyd-death-protests-spread-to-streets-of-new-york-city/,en,False,,287422,laprensalatina.com,http://laprensalatina.com/,"New York City, US, May 28 (efe-epa).- Around 100 people demonstrated in New York City on Thursday over the death of George Floyd in police custody, during which bottles were thrown, protesters clashed with police and dozens were reportedly arrested. Protesters, wearing masks and gloves against COVID-19, gathered in Manhattan’s iconic Union Square carrying placards under the close surveillance of dozens of police. The demonstration traveled through several streets of the city, demanding justice for Floyd and with cries of “I can’t breathe,” his words before he died. At least 40 people were arrested, according to local media, citing the New York Police Department. The 46-year-old African-American man died Monday after a white police officer pinned him to the ground with a knee to the back of his neck while he was handcuffed and other officers stood by. The incident has drawn comparisons to the 2014 death of New York African-American Eric Garner, who was put in a chokehold by police, despite his cries of “I can’t breathe.” Floyd’s death has triggered days of massive protests in the US, and in some cases riots, the burning of buildings and the looting of shops, which has reached New York and played out Thursday during the tense protest against police brutality, as has happened in other notable cases. After chaos and destruction in Minneapolis rallies, areas of the city woke up Thursday to smoke and buildings still on fire. The incident concerning Floyd occurred on Monday night when after receiving a complaint, reportedly that a man might be trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill at a local store, police officers arrived on the scene and found Floyd sitting in his vehicle. When they ordered him to get out, they said he resisted arrest, adding in their official report filed after the incident that after they had handcuffed him and made him lie facedown on the pavement they noticed that he was in “medical distress.” In a video taken by a passerby of Floyd’s arrest and the events leading to his death, the man is seen lying facedown on the pavement beside a patrol car with one of the officers kneeling on the back of his neck for more than five minutes without changing position, despite the fact that Floyd can be heard saying that he cannot breathe and begging for the officers not to hurt him, until he ultimately loses consciousness. “Please, please, please I can’t breathe,” and “My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Please, please. I can’t breathe,” Floyd is heard saying. But the officer never reduced the pressure of his knee and body weight on the man’s neck until an ambulance arrived minutes later and Floyd was loaded onto a stretcher showing no signs of life. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. The FBI has launched a criminal investigation into the case, which has sparked strong reaction across the country, including from New York Police Chief Dermont Shea as well as Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said he was “horrified” after watching the video of the incident. Shea on Thursday turned to the department’s Twitter account to say that what happened “was deeply disturbing. It was wrong.” “We must come together, condemn these actions and reinforce who we are as members of the NYPD,” said Shea, who added it was “not acceptable ANYWHERE.” Cuomo compared the case with Garner’s. “We went through it in New York, we had the Garner case in New York, it’s happened all across the country. How many times do you have to learn the same lesson?” he asked. The Minneapolis Police Department has already announced the firing of the four officers involved, although it has not filed charges against them. Protests have also been reported in Los Angeles, California and Memphis, Tennessee.EFE-EPA rh/tw",0.0

Former deputies such as the ultra-conservative Fernando Linares Beltranena – lawyer for the retired military intelligence general Luis Fernando Ortega Menaldo, members of the far-right organization Guatemala Inmortal, and the director of public relations of the private Francisco Marroquín University, Luis Figueroa, participated in the protest. They entered the historical center of the capital and one of the main avenues of the country and met with a tense moment with riot police who prevented them from passing, since during the coronavirus state of emergency, gatherings are prohibited. Minutes after arguing that they were being denied freedom of movement, the police wall was dispersed and protesters entered the Plaza de la Constitución, where some of them got out of their vehicles with their flags and continued to yell slogans in front of the National Palace of Culture government office. Another visible face in the movement against government’s social measures was the ex-candidate for Congress and columnist Giovanni Fratti, who assured that “crisis management has already failed. The virus has already spread out of the president (Alejandro Giammattei)’s control, it has already left the containment areas and the only thing left to do is to support the president in the health issue.” When asked about the fear of becoming infected due to having gathered outside their vehicles in the central park, Fratti said he was sure of the “sanitary measures” they had taken, such as the mandatory use of masks and social distancing. “I have nothing to fall back on, we want to work,” one protester shouted. Another asked for “public transport,” suspended by Giammattei since March 15. One woman claimed that “without work there is no life” and another woman pleaded: “Let us work, president.” Fratti agreed that non-conformists have “the right to rebel against illegal orders. We are here to tell the president that we are not going to abide by the 15-day lockdown,” in reference to the president suggesting Sunday the possibility of a two-week total lockdown if coronavirus cases increased to 500 a day. After stressing that they were not seeking “government alms,” Fratti emphasized that “all the most advanced economies in the world: Italy, Spain, the United States, Germany, all those economies that have many more cases than Guatemala are already opening their economy. Thus it is a lie that we are going to heal locked up.” The country has recorded 4,145 cases of COVID-19 with 68 deaths. The first of them was registered on Mar. 15, two days after the first case was detected. On Mar. 22, the government of Guatemala decreed a partial curfew that was originally established from 4 pm to 4 am. The curfew now prohibits movement from 5 pm to 5 am, and a complete lockdown has been decreed on the weekends. EFE-EPA ecs/dss/tw",0.0

Asked to confirm reports that he had been shot by a store owner, police spokesman John Elder said that was “one of the theories.” Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon Wednesday near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old George Floyd died on Memorial Day after an officer knelt on his neck until he became unresponsive. Protesters skirmished with officers, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas in a repeat of Tuesday night’s confrontation. On Thursday morning, smoke hung over Minneapolis and looters carried merchandise from a damaged Target store with no interference by police. Video of the store’s interior showed empty clothing racks and shelves and debris strewn about. Obscenities were spray painted on the exterior of the store. Protests spread to other U.S. cities. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers on Wednesday. It was the second night of violent protest in Minneapolis since the death of Floyd, whom police were seeking to arrest outside a Minneapolis grocery store on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. A bystander’s cellphone video showed an officer kneeling on Floyd ‘s neck for almost eight minutes as he eventually became unresponsive. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted for calm early Thursday. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. He also asked for the public’s help in keeping the peace. The officer and three others were fired Tuesday, and on Wednesday, Frey called for him to be criminally charged. Frey asked Gov. Tim Walz to activate the National Guard, a spokesman confirmed Thursday. The governor’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Walz tweeted for calm Wednesday night, calling the violence “an extremely dangerous situation” and urging people to leave the scene. On Wednesday night, officers responding to a reported stabbing near the protests found a man lying on the sidewalk with what turned out to be a bullet wound, Elder said. The man was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Elder said a suspect was in custody but said the facts leading up to the shooting were “still being sorted out.”",0.0

The protest, which was shared earlier on social media, began around 7:30 p.m. when a small crowd of individuals parked their cars on Rembert Street and exited vehicles carrying Black Lives Matter signs. Later, several of the protesters crossed the street to confront the two counter-protesters. Memphis Police Department officers kept the two parties physically apart, but as the verbal confrontation escalated, more protesters started to cross Union and some stopped in the middle of the street, kneeling and blocking traffic. Exchanges between protesters and police officers occurred as the demonstration continued along Union. After silently standing dressed in riot gear on the fringes of the protest, the Memphis police department brought out barricades and placed them between its officers and protesters around 12:20 a.m. Protesters dispersed within the hour. In the aftermath, activists, community leaders and the Shelby County Democratic Party criticized the MPD and Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland.

The protest, which lasted for hours, came at a time when groups of more than 50 are forbidden in Memphis and Shelby County unless there's a clear social distancing plan.

Some shots were heard on scene just before 11:30 p.m., and a police spokeswoman confirmed the injuries at 1 a.m. in a statement. Two victims required surgery. The police department has ""no leads on the shooter"" but is continuing to investigate, Assistant Chief of Police LaVita Chavous said. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said Friday morning five of the shooting victims from the protest are in ""good condition"" and the two victims who required surgery are now ""stable and recovering."" The gunfire ""came from within the crowd, not from officers,"" Fischer said. George Floyd protests erupt across US:Police clear streets after fires in Minneapolis; violence in Columbus, Louisville Chants of ""No justice, no peace"" echoed through the streets as night fell and the hundreds who gathered traveled down Jefferson and Main streets. What started as a peaceful protest in the evening escalated as the night drew on, with the crowd being teargassed and glass storefronts shattered. As heavy rains moved into the area in the early morning hours, much of the crowd dispersed. The protests in Louisville unfurled as other cities saw similar demonstrations over police killings of black Americans. Unrest unfolded Thursday night in Phoenix, Denver and Minneapolis, where a man named George Floyd died this week after an officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck. Floyd's death was captured on camera, igniting a reaction across the nation. Journalists arrested during protest:CNN's Omar Jimenez and crew arrested, released while covering protests over George Floyd death Taylor was shot and killed by several Louisville police officers in March who were serving a no-knock warrant as part of a narcotics investigation, though police have since claimed that they knocked and announced themselves before entering Taylor's apartment that night. On Friday, the mayor said he is suspending the use of no-knock warrants by police. As the situation in downtown Louisville escalated Thursday night, Taylor's family took to social media to plead for peace.

Jessie Halladay, a spokeswoman for LMPD, briefly addressed the media via video chat, saying: ""This is not what we want for our city."" ""What we are seeing tonight in this community is the obvious frustration and tension between police and residents,"" Halladay said. ""What started out as a peaceful protest earlier this evening is now escalating into property damage, more aggressive action and we've just heard reports of shots fired in the crowd.

(AP) — At least seven people were shot in Louisville as protesters turned out to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March. Louisville Metro Police confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn’t provide a number. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city’s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. The protests stretched for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. “Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor’s mother. “As Breonna’s mother says let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice.” Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home. Attention on Taylor’s death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February. Thursday’s demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody. Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor’s family. “Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna’s name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.” Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” A small fire inside a trash can was visible in the middle of the street. Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up around Louisville City Hall. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd. Protesters were shown filming police with their cellphones. Kentuckians are still under social distancing mandates driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Many protesters wore masks. Chants early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.”",0.0

1619973428,2020-05-29 06:13:00,Cliven Bundy Armed Standoff Case Going Back To Court,https://www.wmot.org/post/cliven-bundy-armed-standoff-case-going-back-court,en,False,,310386,wmot.org,http://wmot.org/,"It's been more than two years since Cliven Bundy left the federal courthouse in downtown Las Vegas a free man. His arm around his wife, Carol Bundy, the Nevada rancher was defiant. ""We're not done with this,"" Bundy told reporters in January 2018. ""If the federal government comes after us again we will definitely tell 'em the truth."" On Friday, the Justice Department will try to come after the Bundys again, when federal prosecutors will appeal for a retrial over a 2014 armed standoff between Bundy, his militia and federal agents who had come to round up the rancher's cows that were illegally grazing on federal land. The government's case against Cliven Bundy, his sons, Ammon and Ryan and a Montana militiaman named Ryan Payne, collapsed after a judge declared a mistrial in December 2017. Bundy and his men were accused of conspiracy against federal agents and other charges for their role in the tense standoff which later became a symbol over the fight against federal control of public lands. ""If there is no successful prosecution, it's going to encourage a lot of anarchists like the Bundys to take actions that not only are a threat to themselves but threats to the public at large,"" said Pat Shea, who served as BLM director during the Clinton administration. Retrial effort criticized For their part, the Bundys and their supporters appear puzzled that the federal government is even pursuing a retrial. ""What's really ironic and frankly I think disgusting is that the Trump Justice Department is the one that allowed the U.S. attorney in Nevada to take the appeal,"" said Larry Klayman, Cliven Bundy's attorney. After all, President Trump recently pardoned two Oregon ranchers whose fight with federal land managers inspired Cliven Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, to lead a separate, armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016. Federal prosecutors mostly failed to get convictions in that Oregon case and have been widely criticized for bungling the Nevada trial. Judge Gloria Navarro dismissed the case and later declared a mistrial after ruling federal prosecutors ""deliberately misled"" defense attorneys and the court by failing to provide evidence from surveillance cameras and to disclose the existence of federal snipers near the ranch in the days leading up to the April 2014 standoff. The U.S. attorney's office in Nevada declined an interview request by NPR. But court filings indicate prosecutors will likely argue Friday that their missteps in the 2017 trial were ""inadvertent,"" and in particular they say they were trying to balance disclosing Bureau of Land Management surveillance footage with protecting witnesses against violence. Klayman, who is himself a controversial conservative activist and was once fixture in the ""Birther"" movement, says the DOJ is being hypocritical. He says the investigation against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was recently dropped, but not his clients. ""If you're one of the Washington elite and establishment in the nation's capital, you get special treatment,"" Klayman said. ""If you're Cliven Bundy and his sons and the peaceful protesters, basically you don't."" Most of the federal agents and land managers who were at the 2014 standoff say it was anything but a peaceful protest. Photos and social media posts showed militia training their rifles on armed BLM officers who had come to round up Bundy's cattle. Cliven Bundy has refused to recognize the federal government's ownership of millions of acres of public land — including in Nevada. The rancher has consequently not paid federal fees owed for grazing his cows on land near the Lake Mead National Recreation Area since the 1990s. Pandemic ""resuscitates"" movement Retired federal land managers like Pat Shea have expressed outrage over the government's continued failure to prosecute the Bundys, whose cows continue to graze — for free — on land that's now protected as a national monument. The Bundys' original dispute over grazing goes back decades, stemming from tensions between ranchers and environmentalists and the city of Las Vegas, as it began rapidly expanding into a protected desert tortoise's habitat. Bundy was seen as the last rancher in southern Nevada who refused to get out of the business. But in the years since, his critics say the family's fight has devolved into far right extremism, and a widely debunked legal theory that counties and states, not the federal government, should own public land. ""It's like the COVID-19 virus, they mutate as to their belief system so much that you can never tell what they're going to advocate,"" Shea said. ""They are a danger to themselves and a danger to everyone else they come in contact with."" Indeed, the pandemic has lately brought an opportunity to breathe new life to the Bundys and their self-described patriot movement that had been seen as starting to fade. Ammon Bundy and some of the family's followers have been traveling across the West leading protests against coronavirus public health restrictions, protests that thus far haven't drawn huge numbers. At one recent march in Washington state that was streamed on Facebook, activist Kelli Stewart decried the business closures: ""Come on guys, this is the American way, open rebellion to tyrannical laws, we're not slaves."" A rebellious fight against tyranny, or justice against a family that has flaunted the law for decades, that's a question now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The court takes up the appeal for a retrial in USA vs. Bundy in a virtual session on Friday. ",0.0

Police evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, late Thursday to protect employees, a spokesman said. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, prompting a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Gov. Tim Walz activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. A couple dozen Guard members, armed with assault-style rifles, blocked a street Friday morning near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. By Thursday night, hundreds of demonstrators returned to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence. Demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Local leaders repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard on Thursday, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Among the casualties of the protests: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Anger over the killing extended to Africa, where the head of the African Union Commission on Friday rejected “continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the USA.” In a series of tweets, Moussa Faki Mahamat urged the “total elimination” of all forms of racism in the U.S. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” In a follow-up tweet, he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk” and said he was “not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd’s death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest.",0.0

His arm around his wife, Carol Bundy, the Nevada rancher was defiant. ""We're not done with this,"" Bundy told reporters in January 2018. ""If the federal government comes after us again we will definitely tell 'em the truth."" On Friday, the Justice Department will try to come after the Bundys again, when federal prosecutors will appeal for a retrial over a 2014 armed standoff between Bundy, his militia and federal agents who had come to round up the rancher's cows that were illegally grazing on federal land. The government's case against Cliven Bundy, his sons, Ammon and Ryan and a Montana militiaman named Ryan Payne, collapsed after a judge declared a mistrial in December 2017. Bundy and his men were accused of conspiracy against federal agents and other charges for their role in the tense standoff which later became a symbol over the fight against federal control of public lands. ""If there is no successful prosecution, it's going to encourage a lot of anarchists like the Bundys to take actions that not only are a threat to themselves but threats to the public at large,"" said Pat Shea, who served as BLM director during the Clinton administration. Retrial effort criticized For their part, the Bundys and their supporters appear puzzled that the federal government is even pursuing a retrial. ""What's really ironic and frankly I think disgusting is that the Trump Justice Department is the one that allowed the U.S. attorney in Nevada to take the appeal,"" said Larry Klayman, Cliven Bundy's attorney. After all, President Trump recently pardoned two Oregon ranchers whose fight with federal land managers inspired Cliven Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, to lead a separate, armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016. Federal prosecutors mostly failed to get convictions in that Oregon case and have been widely criticized for bungling the Nevada trial. Judge Gloria Navarro dismissed the case and later declared a mistrial after ruling federal prosecutors ""deliberately misled"" defense attorneys and the court by failing to provide evidence from surveillance cameras and to disclose the existence of federal snipers near the ranch in the days leading up to the April 2014 standoff. The U.S. attorney's office in Nevada declined an interview request by NPR. But court filings indicate prosecutors will likely argue Friday that their missteps in the 2017 trial were ""inadvertent,"" and in particular they say they were trying to balance disclosing Bureau of Land Management surveillance footage with protecting witnesses against violence. Klayman, who is himself a controversial conservative activist and was once fixture in the ""Birther"" movement, says the DOJ is being hypocritical. He says the investigation against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was recently dropped, but not his clients. ""If you're one of the Washington elite and establishment in the nation's capital, you get special treatment,"" Klayman said. ""If you're Cliven Bundy and his sons and the peaceful protesters, basically you don't."" Most of the federal agents and land managers who were at the 2014 standoff say it was anything but a peaceful protest. Photos and social media posts showed militia training their rifles on armed BLM officers who had come to round up Bundy's cattle.

(AP) — At least seven people were shot in Louisville as protesters turned out to demand justice for Breonna Taylor,a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March. Louisville Metro Police confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn’t provide a number. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city’s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. The protests stretched for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. “Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweetedjust before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor’s mother. “As Breonna’s mother says let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice.” Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home. Attention on Taylor’s death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February. Thursday’s demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody. Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor’s family. “Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna’s name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.” Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” A small fire inside a trash can was visible in the middle of the street. Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up around Louisville City Hall. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd. Protesters were shown filming police with their cellphones. Kentuckians are still under social distancing mandates driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Many protesters wore masks. Chants early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.”",0.0

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter.

The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request, but it wasn’t immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was “here with the Minneapolis Fire Department” to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings.

In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice.

Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said.

Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes on Wednesday, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death.Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.",0.0

(WATE)- The death of a black man after a Minneapolis Police officer held his knee on the man’s neck has sparked protests and riots all across the country. The death of George Floyd has also lead to many leaders across the country condemning the officer’s actions, including in East Tennessee. Mayor Indya Kincannon said Thursday she spoke with Knoxville Police Chief Eve Thomas about Floyd’s death and preventing a similar situation taking place in Knoxville. After the National Fraternal Order of Police released a statement condemning the Minneapolis officer’s actions, 6 On Your Side reached out to Knoxville’s chapter for comment. Keith Lyons, president of the Knoxville FOP, and a Knoxville Police officer himself, said that even though he doesn’t know exactly why the Minneapolis officer held Floyd down with his knee on Floyd’s neck, he could never imagine a scenario that required the officer for holding him in that position for so long. “Standing on somebody’s neck is not good. I mean, a typical boxing match or MMA fight is only three minutes per round. And they give them a rest period of 30 seconds in between. So six minutes under that kind of stress isn’t healthy for anybody,” Lyons said. He said that officers often learn what not to do based on other’s first-hand experiences. Lyons said though that officers have been trained since at least the 90s in ways to not cut off a suspect’s airway. “If we’ve had to get on top of somebody, we immediately turn them to their side so they can breathe,” Lyons said. Lyons said that he hoped the community wouldn’t judge all law enforcement officers after the situation. He said that like most professions, most officers truly want to do good work and help the community. Constance Every, a member of the local Black Lives Matters group and president of Black Coffee Justice, said Floyd’s death could’ve been avoided long before it happened. She said that coworkers in any profession can tell when another employee has racial or sexist tendencies. She said those actions need to be properly handled by their superiors. “You’re in those locker rooms and you hear those jokes that are unacceptable, or you hear those comments, or you even hear somebody flat out say, ‘I pulled this car over only because I knew it was this, that and there.’ Oh so you’re making assumptions now? When you hear this type of behavior going on, or this cultural practice going on in your police department, you as the good cop have a duty to address the bad cop,” Every said. Every said that Black Lives Matters, as well as several local activist groups in Knoxville, plan to protest the treatment that lead to Floyd’s death and man other black people who recently died at the hands of law enforcement, as well as demand body cameras and for mental health professionals to be hired within the Knoxville Police Department. Every said the protest will be peaceful, and doesn’t want someone to attend if they have negative intentions. The protest will start at 6 p.m.",0.0

This is a lie. We all saw it. This spin is erroneous and disingenuous,"" she tweeted in response. ""You do your organization a disservice by even trying this nonsense. Stop tweeting and learn how to do your jobs properly. Start with reading the constitution."" CNN anchor Jim Sciutto also rebutted the statement. ""He showed his press credentials before he was arrested,"" he tweeted. ""They confirmed they were members of the media before they were arrested. Your tweet is a lie. The entire world saw what happened. Why do you think you can get away with lying?"" user @DadScribe tweeted. ""Omar Jimenez identified himself as a journalist with CNN to you folks while reporting live. Who are you kidding?"" user @cmclymer added. In a press conference, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said he takes ""full responsibility"" for the incident. ""There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he continued. ""Calls were made immediately. This is a very public apology to that team."" CNN Communications team tweeted an earlier statement about the incident, calling it ""a clear violation of their First Amendment rights. The authorities in Minnesota, incl. the Governor, must release the 3 CNN employees immediately."" What we know:Minneapolis protests escalate as police precinct set on fire, CNN reporter arrested; Trump lashes out at looters on Twitter CNN later reported that that network's president talked to governor, who ""deeply apologizes"" calling what happened “totally unacceptable."" ""We want the media there to cover this,"" he added, saying he accepts full responsibility. USA TODAY has reached out to the governor's office for comment. CNN kept the cameras rolling while they heard from other contributors. “It doesn’t make any sense to me… you can see his credentials,” Law Enforcement Analyst Charles Ramsey said. “It just makes no sense.” Correspondent Josh Campbell, who was also at the protest, said he wondered if appearances played a part. Campbell is white and Jimenez is Black and Latino. ""I was treated much differently than he was,"" Campbell said. Later in the broadcast, you could hear officers announce, ""You are ordered to leave this area immediately."" Jimenez tweeted about the scene earlier today before his arrest. ""The images out of Minneapolis right now are unbelievable. Thousands in the streets, a police precinct on fire, fireworks being fired into those flames. All while we wait on whether charges will be filed against the officers involved in the death of George Floyd. #GeorgeFloyd,"" he tweeted. Following the incident, Jimenez showed he was back to work in a tweeted photo. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. The horrifying bystander video of Floyd's death spread quickly on social media, showing the officer driving his knee into Floyd's neck as the handcuffed man repeatedly says he can't breathe. Four officers involved in the incident have been fired, and an attorney representing Floyd's family, Ben Crump, has called for their arrests. Contributing: Ryan W.

1620058559,2020-05-29 08:19:28,"Trump calls Floyd death 'shocking,' calls protesters 'thugs'",http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129745,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump added fuel to racial fires Friday as he threatened to take action to bring the city of Minneapolis ""under control,"" calling violent protesters outraged by the death of a black man in police custody ""thugs"" and reviving a civil-rights era phrase fraught with racist overtones. ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" Trump wrote in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against ""glorifying violence."" The White House said the president ""did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it."" Trump's comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, capping three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. The president's reaction — a day after he had decried Floyd's treatment and vowed justice for his family — underscored Trump's complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order"" mantle while also trying to build his appeal among black voters during an election year. And it highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department's efforts to ""combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign."" In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful ""because I've let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" ""We don't mind being accused of police brutality,"" he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. The White House did not respond to questions about where Trump had heard the phrase and what he meant by it. But Trump said Friday afternoon, after many hours of backlash, that he had meant that, ""Looting leads to shooting."" ""I don't want this to happen, and that's what the expression put out last night means,"" he tweeted. ""It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement. It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media. Honor the memory of George Floyd!"" But criticism was nonetheless swift. ""It's not helpful,"" said Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, during a news briefing Friday. ""Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging."" Trump's presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden said it was ""no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence."" And Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed the chance to help the public cope with ""two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus."" Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky did not address Trump's tweets but decried the recent deaths of African Americans as ""the latest disturbing chapters in our long, unfinished American struggle to ensure that equal justice under law is not conditional on the color of one's skin."" Still, he said that, ""Stealing, burning down buildings, attacking law enforcement officers or laying siege to police precincts is not speech or protest. It is violent crime that victimizes innocent people."" Twitter's action Friday morning marked the second time this week that the social media giant has flagged the president's content, this time adding a warning label that prevented it from being shared or liked. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, thus accusing the White House of promoting violence. Floyd's death and fury it has sparked are set against the backdrop of a heated presidential election and competing political priorities for the president. Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump — who rarely holds his tongue — has been silent in the face a long list of high-profile police-involved killings of black men, including Eric Garner, who died after being placed in a chokehold by police and whose dying words, ""I can't breathe,"" became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) Trump has long portrayed himself as a staunch defender of law and order. He has often spoken in front of law enforcement groups, and in one speech appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after his presumptive Democratic opponent, former Vice President Biden, suggested last week that black voters who support Trump ""ain't black."" A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference — and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president's charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign's plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Trump's back-and-forth with Twitter comes a day after he signed an executive order challenging the site's protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The company said it had flagged Trump's latest tweet ""in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts."" Supporters of the president balked at the move. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of ""purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.""",0.0

Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died after a white officer named Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for several minutes, with Floyd saying that he couldn't breathe. The four officers who were at the scene have been fired, but no charges have been filed against them yet. Massive protests and riots have erupted in Minneapolis and other cities this week as a result. Anderson's written statement, released on Thursday evening, followed similar condemnations of the Minneapolis officers from Gov. Bill Lee — who called the incident ""horrific"" and ""heartbreaking"" — and the local police union. ""Every officer in our police department and throughout the country should be emotionally shaken by what has occurred in Minneapolis,"" Anderson said. ""Words cannot adequately express my disdain over the actions that led to the death of George Floyd. The total lack of concern shown by the officer as he continued to hold his knee to the neck of Mr. Floyd as he repeatedly struggled to breathe is unconscionable. Also intolerable is the lack of intervention of the officers who stood there."" But local activists and advocates for police oversight were quick to note a contrast between Anderson's ""disdain"" for the actions of officers in Minneapolis and his reaction to fatal police shootings in Nashville. In 2017, a white Metro officer named Josh Lippert shot and killed a black man named Jocques Clemmons who was fleeing a traffic stop on foot. Lippert was not charged in the fatal shooting. Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk concluded that the officer acted justifiably in self-defense after Clemmons dropped, and then retrieved, a gun he was said to be carrying during the chase. Lippert was never fired, despite months of protest from Clemmons' family and supporters. He resigned more than two years after the shooting. Less than 18 months later, a white officer named Andrew Delke shot and killed a black man named Daniel Hambrick as Hambrick fled. Police alleged that Hambrick was carrying a gun as he fled, and Delke has claimed that Hambrick turned and pointed the gun at him during the chase. That cannot be seen on any surveillance footage of the incident. Prosecutors do not dispute that Hambrick was carrying a gun but have argued that Hambrick could not have pointed the gun at Delke during the brief period of time he was in a surveillance blind spot. Delke is awaiting trial on a first-degree murder charge. But Anderson's defensive posture after the Hambrick shooting — which followed the chief's previous resistance to attempts at police oversight and accountability — led to calls from community groups and Metro Council members for him to be replaced. The Nashville Fraternal Order of Police released a statement Thursday calling the actions of the officers during Floyd's arrest ""indefensible."" But after the Hambrick shooting in Nashville, the union launched a website aimed at vilifying the young black victim. Two black men have been shot by Nashville police this month. A North Nashville man named Sekou Allen was shot in the leg on May 13 after officers responded to a reported domestic incident. Police say that Allen continued advancing on them after they used a Taser on him. On May 21, Nashville officers shot and killed a man named William Johnson, who according to police fled after shooting an off-duty officer near his home. Nashville's Community Oversight Board has raised concerns about the cooperation of the police department and other Metro agencies in these incidents, a continuation of problems that have plagued the board since its creation.",0.0

Black Lives Matter leaders say it’s not the counter protest that upsets them. It’s how authorities handled the events that followed. The protest initially began just as designed: peacefully, responsibly – a show of support for George Floyd, who was killed by Minneapolis Police earlier this week. “We could do this silently, we could do this respectfully, we could do this by implementing and incorporating CDC guidelines,” said protest organizer Ayo Akinmoladun. Less than an hour in, counter protesters appeared, allegedly shouting racial slurs and insults. Some claimed they were members of the group “Confederate 901”. That’s when police got involved, separating the two groups. Black Lives Matter advocates are most upset with what they call unbalanced treatment, a topic the city views differently. “Why is it that police officers police certain groups of people in a more violent, inhumane way?” said Reverend Andre Johnson. Thursday, Mayor Jim Strickland praised the police department. “I want to say how proud I am of the Memphis Police Department and those particularly officers who were on the scene last night. I thought they handled themselves very well,” Strickland said. Organizers, including County Commissioner Tami Sawyer, are calling for action from the city’s top officials. “They never come and engage with us and say ‘Hey, what’s going on, how can I listen to you?’ And we’ve experience this over and over and over again,” Sawyer said. “If the narrative continues to be shaped in a way that is detrimental to protesters, then there will be another protest,” Akinmoladun said.",0.0

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. Trump, who called protesters in Minneapolis “thugs,” drew another warning from Twitter for his rhetoric, saying it violated the platform’s rules about “glorifying violence.” A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night at City Hall near 2 a.m. Friday and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers there.

I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were being stationed in locations to help stem looting, including banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. On Friday morning, the Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew as they reported on the unrest in Minneapolis. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also led away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Atlanta-based CNN said that the crew, which included CNN reporter Omar Jimenez, was released later Friday morning. While live on air, Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also led away in handcuffs. #BREAKING: Rioters have taking over 3rd precinct police station #Minneapolis and set it on fire, helicopter saving officers on the roof. #GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/Q5vSgxU0Yz — Jack Dawkins (@DawkinsReturns) May 29, 2020 CNN’s communications team earlier said on Twitter that the crew was arrested “for doing their jobs, despite identifying themselves — a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” The Minnesota State Patrol said on Twitter that the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order.” The patrol said they “were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media.” Late Thursday in Minneapolis, cheering protesters torched a police station that the department abandoned as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S. Thick smoke rose over the city as fires burned Friday morning. Firefighters worked to contain a number of fires as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. A couple dozen Guard members, armed with assault-style rifles, blocked a street Friday morning near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. Fire larger now .

But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” NAPA collapsed, firefighters trying to save that deli next door pic.twitter.com/9OImZILpes — Nick Ferraro (@NFerraroPiPress) May 29, 2020 The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between officers and protesters but no widespread property damage. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Anger over the killing also has spread in Africa, where the head of the African Union Commission on Friday rejected “continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the USA.” In a series of tweets, Moussa Faki Mahamat urged the “total elimination” of all forms of racism in the U.S. In Mississippi, Petal Mayor Hal Marx resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. The Republican on Twitter asked “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” and in a follow-up tweet said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes on Wednesday, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard.",0.0
1620175015,2020-05-29 09:00:00,"Trump tweets ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts’. Twitter adds ‘glorifying violence’ warning",https://wreg.com/news/twitter-adds-glorifying-violence-warning-to-trump-tweet/,en,True,,78089,wreg.com,http://www.wreg.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday called protesters in Minneapolis “thugs” and said that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” — drawing another warning from Twitter for his rhetoric. Trump tweeted after protesters outraged by the death of a black man in police custody torched a police station. Earlier Thursday, Trump said, “I feel very, very badly” about George Floyd’s death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. “That’s a very shocking sight.” It was the kind of personal statement expected from a president in response to the disturbing video of a black man gasping for help as a white policeman pinned him to the street by the neck. But it was a very different tone for Trump, who has often been silent in the face of white-on-black violence and has a long history of defending police. Trump’s language got more aggressive as violence boiled over in Minneapolis on Thursday night. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” he tweeted. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” Twitter added a warning to Trump’s tweet about the Minneapolis protests, saying it violated the platform’s rules about “glorifying violence.” Earlier this week, it applied fact checks to two of his tweets about mail-in ballots. Once more likely to hew to the “blue lives matter” mantra, Trump and his allies have been questioning an officer’s conduct and calling for justice for Floyd. But some activists doubt that Trump has suddenly evolved on the issue of police brutality and instead see election year political calculations. “This is the first race-tinged case that I’ve ever heard him address” as president, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and Trump critic who has known the president for decades. “So therefore he cannot be upset when people feel that it’s empty words because it is so out of character.” Trump has been silent on a number of high-profile police-involved killings, including that of Stephon Clark, a black man shot by Sacramento, California, police in 2018. “This is something that is a local matter and that’s something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities,” then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time. Trump has never addressed the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold by police trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes. Video of the encounter was viewed millions of times online, and Garner’s dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has, however, invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect. Trump has a long history of injecting himself into racially sensitive cases. In 1989, he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of a brutal assault on a jogger. Trump has never apologized, telling reporters last year: “You have people on both sides of that.” Trump also spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And he has even appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. But Trump’s tone has changed in recent weeks as he has repeatedly expressed dismay at footage of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man fatally shot in February in Georgia while jogging. “You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends,” he told reporters this month. “It’s a heartbreaking thing.” The president has notably left open the possibility of some other explanation, saying: “it could be something that we didn’t see on tape.” Trump and his allies have been even clearer on the death of Floyd, who can be heard and seen on tape pleading that he couldn’t breathe before he slowly stops talking and moving. Trump “was very upset when he saw that video,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. “He wants justice to be served.” Trump’s conservative allies also rallied to the cause. Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity said he is “a big supporter of law enforcement” but expressed outrage Wednesday, telling his audience: “The lack of training here is breathtaking.” “We got to get to the very bottom of how this poor individual was treated, and the death of him on the video itself is shocking from what I saw,” Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said. Even conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who once called Black Lives Matter a “terrorist group,” said Floyd’s death was totally “unjustified” and he was “so mad.” The outpouring comes as the Trump campaign has sought to chip into the advantage Democrats have with black voters. The campaign hopes either to win enough black support to keep pivotal states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in play or minimize enthusiasm for Democratic rival Joe Biden. There could be a small window after Biden last week told a prominent black radio host that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black,” a gaffe he later said he regretted. Trump and his allies have seized on that and other Biden statements, even though Biden, who served as vice president under the nation’s first black president, remains deeply popular among black voters, who helped him secure the Democratic nomination. Indeed, a recent Fox News poll found that just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, versus 75% who have a favorable view of Biden. Chris White, the longtime director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, questioned the sincerity of Republicans’ response to the deaths of Arbery and Floyd. The White House and Department of Justice have long had the power to address these issues. “Any time we hear politicians speaking about dealing with police brutality in the middle of election year, it’s just meaningless rhetoric that has a hollow promise,” he said. Sharpton credited both the magnitude of outrage in response to Floyd’s death as well as the upcoming election for the changed approach. But he doubted many black voters will be swayed with an approach they may see as too little, too late. “It’s like a father that misses a kid’s graduation of high school, graduation of college,” he said. “He can’t be upset when the kid looks at him suspiciously when he’s there when he graduates with his Ph.D.”",0.0
1620197850,2020-05-29 11:12:00,Minneapolis Seethes Over George Floyd's Death As Trump Calls Protesters 'THUGS',https://www.wmot.org/post/minneapolis-seethes-over-george-floyds-death-trump-calls-protesters-thugs,en,False,,310386,wmot.org,http://wmot.org/,"Minneapolis is burning. For a third straight night, the Midwestern city saw clashes between police and protesters after the death of George Floyd, a black man whose arresting officer was recorded kneeling on his neck for minutes on end. The four officers involved have been fired and the incident is under federal investigation, but demonstrators are not satisfied. Some of them stormed the 3rd Police Precinct, setting fire to that building and others in the neighborhood. President Trump, who called Floyd's death ""very sad and tragic"" earlier this week, said early Friday that he had told Minnesota's governor that ""the Military is with him all the way."" He also described the source of the unrest as ""THUGS"" — a word widely criticized for bearing racial overtones. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" he continued, in a tweet flagged by Twitter for violating its policy against glorifying violence. The president's comments came after a night of chaos in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, where several fires raged and some businesses were sacked, according to Minnesota Public Radio. Protesters also overran the 3rd Precinct after police withdrew in an attempt to mitigate tensions. ""Brick and mortar is not as important as life,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, noting that though the building was emptied, patrols would continue in the neighborhood. ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" Minneapolis has seethed since the release of the video depicting Floyd's arrest by a white police officer. The officer plants a knee on his neck for at least seven minutes as Floyd cries for help and eventually falls silent and as bystanders shout that he's dying. The officer did not remove his knee until paramedics showed up to move Floyd's unresponsive body into an ambulance. He was reported dead later that night. Since then, Minneapolis has seen a series of escalating protests over his death, while anger has been evident in other cities, as well. Protesters have turned out to express their outrage as far as Los Angeles and New York City. Meanwhile in Louisville, Ky., demonstrators gathered Thursday to protest death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot by police in her home in March. As one protester in Minneapolis told NPR, the anger over Floyd's death is about more than just one man — it's about how police treat black people across the U.S. ""This is how our people react, you know? When we've been done wrong for so long,"" he said. ""So, me, I'm just praying and hoping everybody makes it home safe."" On Friday morning, state police arrested a CNN crew while they were reporting about the unrest on live television. ""A black reporter from CNN was arrested while legally covering the protests in Minneapolis,"" the network pointedly noted. ""A white reporter also on the ground was not."" The crew consisting of correspondent Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez was released about an hour later. CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker said that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz personally apologized to him for the incident. The swift backtrack did little to soften the shock of the spectacle, though. ""With all the perversions of American democracy that we have witnessed, few rival the dystopian spectacle of a U.S. journalist calmly reporting the news and repeatedly offering to reposition his crew at the police's request, only to be arrested, cuffed and hauled away alongside his crew,"" said Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America, advocacy group that fights for press freedom. She added: ""For us at PEN America, where we routinely document the arrest and imprisonment of writers and journalists worldwide, the action was eerily familiar, but something we expect to see in authoritarian states: Turkey, Hong Kong, Egypt. To see it in the United States of America is appalling."" NPR's Adrian Florido contributed to this report. ",0.0

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced the charges Friday, shortly after Chauvin was taken into custody by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The announcement comes days after the release of a video that shows Chauvin's knee pressed firmly on the black man's neck for at least seven minutes. That video has inspired outrage nationwide and unrest in Minneapolis and had led to Chauvin's firing as well as that of three other officers seen in the video. Asked why Chauvin wasn't arrested earlier — something demanded by protesters and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — Freeman said his office moved as quickly as possible in its investigation. He added that the three other former officers remain under investigation and that he anticipates charges for them, too. The Department of Justice is also conducting an investigation on ""a separate and parallel track,"" U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Friday in a statement. ""Both state and federal officers are working diligently and collaboratively to ensure that any available evidence relevant to these decisions is obtained as quickly as possible,"" Barr said. Those investigations, coupled with the officers' firings, has so far failed to satisfy the protesters who had gathered for a third night Thursday in Minneapolis. Some of them stormed the 3rd Police Precinct, the closest precinct to the site of Floyd's arrest, setting fire to that building after police withdrew in an attempt to mitigate tensions. Rioters burned and looted other buildings in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The region has seethed since the release of the video depicting Floyd's arrest, which shows Floyd crying for help before falling silent, while bystanders shout that he's dying. The officer did not remove his knee until paramedics showed up to move Floyd's unresponsive body into an ambulance. He was reported dead later Monday night. In an attempt to avoid another night of chaos, officials ordered a nighttime curfew in Minneapolis and St. Paul beginning at 8 p.m. local time Friday and Saturday nights and continuing until 6 a.m., although the curfew was widely ignored. Here is the latest on the situation: Floyd's family: ""We want a first-degree murder charge"" Floyd's family said that prosecutors have made ""a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice,"" in a statement issued shortly after the announcement that Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. But they feel that authorities haven't gone far enough. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested. We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer,"" the family said in a statement shared by their attorney. In Minnesota, a third-degree murder conviction can result in up to 25 years in prison, while murder in the first degree brings a possible life sentence. ""The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw,"" the family added, ""and is spilling out onto streets across America."" Gov. Tim Walz: ""I understand clearly there is no trust"" During a news conference Friday morning, the Minnesota governor acknowledged the pain of those outraged by Floyd's death in police custody — whose name he added to a list of ""unheard"" black men killed by police, including Philando Castile, who was shot in 2016 by police in a suburb of St. Paul. ""The very tools that we need to use to get control to make sure that buildings aren't burned and the rule of law doesn't collapse are those very institutional tools that have led to that grief and pain. I understand clearly there is no trust in many of our communities,"" Walz told reporters. ""But I'm asking you to help us use humane ways to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice, so that those that are expressing rage and anger and demanding justice are heard."" President Trump's tweet about ""THUGS"" flagged for glorifying violence The president, who called Floyd's death ""very sad and tragic"" earlier this week, said early Friday that he had told Minnesota's governor that ""the Military is with him all the way."" He also described the source of the unrest as ""THUGS"" — a word widely criticized for bearing racial overtones. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" he continued in a tweet partially hidden and flagged by Twitter for violating its policy against ""glorifying violence."" Trump did not miss the social network's decision. Not long after the move, the president — who signed an executive order Thursday aimed at limiting the legal protections afforded to social media companies such as Twitter — took aim at the company with a tweet saying it ""will be regulated."" Trump later sought to clarify his initial tweet, saying that shooting simply can occur when looting gets out of hand. ""It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,"" Trump explained in a pair of tweets. ""It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media."" In a tweet of his own, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said he is ""furious"" that Trump ""is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many."" Gov. Walz apologizes for brief arrest of CNN crew On Friday morning, state police arrested a CNN crew while it was reporting about the unrest on live television: ""A black reporter from CNN was arrested while legally covering the protests in Minneapolis,"" the network pointedly noted. ""A white reporter also on the ground was not."" The crew of correspondent Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez was released about an hour later, and Walz repeatedly apologized during his news conference Friday. ""A few minutes after hearing [about the arrest] I was on a call with CNN President Jeff Zucker, who demanded to know what happened. I take full responsibility,"" Walz said Friday. ""There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen. Calls were made immediately. This is a very public apology to that team. It should not happen."" The swift backtrack did little to soften the shock of the spectacle, though. ""With all the perversions of American democracy that we have witnessed, few rival the dystopian spectacle of a U.S. journalist calmly reporting the news and repeatedly offering to reposition his crew at the police's request, only to be arrested, cuffed and hauled away alongside his crew,"" said Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America, advocacy group that fights for press freedom. She added: ""For us at PEN America, where we routinely document the arrest and imprisonment of writers and journalists worldwide, the action was eerily familiar, but something we expect to see in authoritarian states: Turkey, Hong Kong, Egypt. To see it in the United States of America is appalling."" Obama and others nationwide respond to Floyd's death Demonstrators in Minneapolis are not alone in their outrage over Floyd's death. Activists spilled onto city streets across the country, holding protests seeking justice for the Minneapolis man as well as other unarmed black men and women who have died at the hands of law enforcement officers or in police custody. Large protests were held outside the White House and outside the CNN headquarters in Atlanta, as well as in cities including New York, Houston and San Jose, Calif. Among those who took to social media to express their pain and frustration Friday was former President Barack Obama. ""It's natural to wish for life 'to just get back to normal' as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly 'normal' – whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park,"" Obama said in a statement posted to social media. In speaking of jogging and bird-watching, the former president referred to two other videos that have inspired outrage this month — one in which a black man was followed and killed by two white men while out for a run in Georgia, and another in which a white woman called police on a black bird-watcher in New York City after he asked her to leash her dog. ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" Obama said. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" My statement on the death of George Floyd: pic.twitter.com/Hg1k9JHT6R — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 29, 2020 Protesters have turned out to express their outrage as far as Los Angeles and New York City.

We'll have more in a second on a controversial, since-deleted tweet from Memphis Tigers basketball player Lance Thomas, and on YMCA expanding free child care for essential workers. But first... Moved by the horrifying images of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, protesters last night sat on Beale Street and imagined not being able to breathe. The peaceful demonstration, which drew about 60 protesters, was the second in as many nights against police brutality, our Micaela Watts and Laura Testino report. Unlike at the previous night's protest, which briefly closed Union Avenue in Midtown, no racist counter-protesters showed up and the police presence was noticeably less pronounced. Officers didn't don riot gear — or violently shove a woman to the ground in a clear case of excessive force that should mean disciplinary action for the officer. Buy Photo Protesters gathering along Beale Street in Downtown Memphis speaking out against police brutality for the second night in a row on Thursday, May 28, 2020. (Photo: Joe Rondone/The Commercial Appeal) Yesterday, after the pepper spray had cleared, the Shelby County Democratic Party and several elected officials criticized Memphis police for knocking over the woman and for arresting at least five people. One of those was Rep. G.A. Hardaway, D-Memphis: ""They (police officers) were out of line last night, and I'm being kind when I say that,"" said Hardaway, who did not attend the protest, noting a moment when a member of MPD used a riot shield and knocked a woman over. But the criticism flowed both ways yesterday, if not with equal force. Like Gov. Bill Lee, Mayor Jim Strickland said he was angered by what happened to Floyd, but Strickland also took protesters to task for not wearing masks or maintaining safe social distance, our Sam Hardiman reports. Last night, most protesters seemed to be wearing masks. Pause for a second and let it sink in that this is what Memphians are talking about. Not all protests are made equal, and the protests Memphis has seen these past two nights have been the right kind — unlike what's happening in Minneapolis right now. The wrong kind returns hate for hate and violence for violence, giving outlet to the darkest parts of human nature; it loots and burns because its aim is to destroy and not to heal. Thank God these two protests in Memphis don't fit that description. The question now is whether the next protest in Memphis, whenever it is, will be the right kind. To that end, Memphis police have to hold officers to a higher standard, not relax them, and swiftly and appropriately punish any officers who cross the lines. But protest organizers also have a responsibility to set the tone of demonstrations. Stop giving microphones to people who are foolish enough to indiscriminately hate police. Keeping Memphis from going up in flames like Minneapolis will require people of conscience on both sides of the barricades to work for the good of their city. Who's silencing Tigers' Lance Thomas? Memphis Tigers basketball player Lance Thomas took a controversial stand on Twitter Wednesday after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, our Evan Barnes reports. Here's the tweet, which he quickly deleted: ""Not even going to lie. I’m never pledging allegiance to the American Flag before any of my games or anywhere I’m at ever again. I refuse to pledge allegiance to a country that practices killing black people for sport."" He followed up with an apology: To anyone who took any offense to my tweet that wasn’t the intention at all but let’s take a look at the injustice at hand smh🤦🏾‍♂️ — Lance Thomas (@Lancegreek) May 27, 2020 Whether he stands or kneels is his personal choice, and should be left entirely up to him. But not everyone feels the same way, based on a follow-up tweet in which he said someone — he didn't say who — made him delete his original tweet: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂made me take it down — Lance Thomas (@Lancegreek) May 27, 2020 Was it a relative? The school? His coach? It's unclear, but our Jason Munz spoke with Memphis athletic director Laird Veatch, who generally expressed support for Thomas. YMCA expands free child care program Starting Monday, the YMCA of Memphis and the Mid-South will offer free child care to ""essential"" workers at eight Memphis community centers, our Laura Testino reports. That's an expansion of the YMCA's existing free child care program, which currently consists of 700 children of essential workers at 18 YMCAs.

The video was taken at a distance and the officer is not identifiable from these images. Demster also posted a second video on Facebook that was recorded by the woman who was knocked down. That video shows police officers with helmets, riot shields and batons arriving, then the camera suddenly falling to the pavement following an unseen shock. WMC TV interviewed the woman who was knocked down and identified her as a 23-year-old named Molly — her last name was not published. Demster said he's meeting with Molly on Friday evening to offer help she may need, including walking her through the police internal affairs complaint process and connecting her with an attorney. “She specifically told me that she wanted to press charges against the officers,"" Demster said. ""So she will discuss that this evening.” He said she had scrapes and bruises but didn't have broken bones or other major injuries. Protests also took place Thursday night in Memphis. CLOSE Protestors lead to a shut down of Union Avenue in Midtown, clashes with anti-protestors and police. *Explicit language some viewers may find offensive Memphis Commercial Appeal After announcing investigation, Strickland shares Obama's tweet On Friday afternoon, hours after he announced that he had asked MPD to investigate the incident where the woman was knocked to the ground, Strickland also issued a call for change. He shared a tweet from former U.S. President Barack Obama that urged law enforcement and everyone else to create ""'a new normal' in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts."" Strickland posted the tweet that said: ""I agree and commit to this thoughtful challenge from @BarackObama."" Investigative reporter Daniel Connolly welcomes tips and comments from the public.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

Knoxville News Sentinel UPDATE: A mass of demonstrators took to the streets and marched for hours through downtown Knoxville after the rally Friday evening at police headquarters. Read more here. Previous story: Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Knoxville Police Department's headquarters Friday evening amid unrest across the country after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on the neck of George Floyd until he died. Hosted in part by Black Lives Matter Knoxville, the protest took place in the parking lot of the police building, 800 Howard Baker Jr. Ave., starting at 6 p.m. ""We demand justice for all our brothers and sisters murdered by police!"" the Black Lives Matter Knoxville Facebook page stated, adding that attendees should bring masks, signs and ""noise makers."" ""All Americans have a constitutional right to gather and peacefully demonstrate,"" Knoxville Police Department spokesman Scott Erland said Friday morning. 'Say his name': How Knoxville protested the killing of George Floyd The planned protest came amid growing unrest across the country after a white police officer was captured on video driving his knee into the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old handcuffed black man, in Minneapolis. Floyd died Monday after the officer kept him pinned to the ground for nine minutes despite the victim pleading, ""I can't breathe."" Four Minneapolis Police Department officers were fired. Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was arrested Friday on charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter, prosecutors said. In a joint statement issued shortly before news of the arrest broke, Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon and Knoxville Police Chief Eve Thomas condemned the actions of the former Minneapolis officers, saying in part: ""We are outraged by the brutal actions of the officers involved in the death of George Floyd. We condemn this egregious behavior and will work tirelessly to make sure nothing like this ever happens in our community.” Gov. Bill Lee on Thursday made similar comments, saying the ex-officers ""should be brought to justice for the loss of that life,"" and that ""police brutality is not law enforcement."" ""Police brutality should not be accepted in this state and it shouldn't be tolerated,"" Lee said during his daily COVID-19 news briefing. ""I don't believe we should or will tolerate it in the days ahead. It's unacceptable."" In a tweet that has been shared widely, Chattanooga Police Chief David Roddy wrote: ""There is no need to see more video. There is no need to wait to see how it 'plays out.' There is no need to put a knee on someone's neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don't have an issue with this... turn it in."" In Memphis, where protests against police brutality over two nights have ended without violence, Mayor Jim Strickland similarly condemned the actions of the four officers. He also criticized local protesters for not observing social distancing during the pandemic. Protests in several American cities, however, turned violent Thursday night. In Minneapolis, police retreated as protesters set fire to a precinct and others looted buildings. President Donald Trump on Twitter then criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and wrote ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black EMT who was shot dead in March by police serving a controversial ""no-knock"" search warrant. Gunfire rang out in Louisville on Thursday night after a group of protesters attacked an armored vehicle; at least seven people were shot and wounded, the Courier-Journal reported. Louisville police said officers did not fire their guns. In Denver, Colorado, unidentified gunfire outside the state capitol building sent protesters running for cover, the Associated Press reported. Police there fired tear gas canisters and rubber bullets at protesters, who blocked traffic and smashed vehicles, the AP reported. Videos posted on social media also showed a vehicle striking a protester. What do the Knoxville protesters want? The Facebook page for the Knoxville protest said protesters were demanding criminal charges for ""killer cops,"" more mental health professionals instead of additional police officers, more resources for the city's independent police review board and the implementation of body-worn cameras for officers. City officials already are working to equip Knoxville Police Department officers with body cameras. Money for the cameras was included in Mayor Kincannon's budget proposal, which was adopted by city council last week. In January, Kincannon said she hoped to have officers wearing body cameras by this summer; Police Chief Eve Thomas said then she hoped to have it done by July 1. ""Steps continue to be taken to get the cameras 'on the street' as soon as possible,"" reads Friday's joint statement from Kincannon and Thomas. A renewed push for body cameras came after Knoxville Police Department officer Dylan Williams fatally shot Channara ""Philly"" Pheap after a struggle in August 2019. Investigating authorities for months declined to release key details about the shooting, and activists cited the lack of information to call for increased transparency and body cameras. Those calls grew in intensity after the Knox County Regional Forensic Center released a preliminary document to Pheap's family that listed his cause of death as ""gunshot wound of back."" Prosecutors ultimately declined to charge Williams, saying the evidence showed he was justified in shooting Pheap after Pheap choked him, grabbed his Taser and used it on him when the officer tried to arrest him in connection to a hit-and-run. Pheap, who was of Cambodian descent, likely turned to the side just as Williams, who is white, fired his service weapon, authorities said. The dashboard camera in Williams' cruiser captured Pheap fighting the officer before the shooting. The shooting itself was not caught on video. Full statement from Knoxville officials Below is the full statement from Mayor Kincannon and Chief Thomas on the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon and Police Chief Eve Thomas issued a joint statement today (May 29, 2020), condemning the actions of the Minneapolis police officers involved in the death of George Floyd. On Monday, Floyd died in police custody after repeatedly saying “I can’t breathe,” as an officer was kneeling on his neck. The City leaders state, “We are outraged by the brutal actions of the officers involved in the death of George Floyd. We condemn this egregious behavior and will work tirelessly to make sure nothing like this ever happens in our community.” Mayor Kincannon went on to say, “I watched the video of a Minneapolis police officer pressing his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck continuously for at least 9 minutes, despite Mr. Floyd’s pleas that he could not breathe, despite on-lookers begging the officers to let him breathe. It is completely horrifying. The Minneapolis police officers’ actions are unjustified and inhumane. My heart goes out to the Floyd family. We are all impacted by this senseless death. “I understand that incidents like this undermine a community’s trust in those who are supposed to protect and serve them. They challenge all of us to acknowledge racism and work actively against it, at all levels of government and in all corners of our communities. While this happened hundreds of miles away, Chief Thomas and I are committed, here in Knoxville, to continue to take proactive measures to make sure officers are properly trained and understand this type of behavior will not be tolerated.” Chief Thomas echoed the Mayor’s statements and added, “I was deeply disturbed and appalled by the events that led to the death of George Floyd, and condemn the actions and inactions of the former Minneapolis police officers that resulted in this unimaginable and entirely avoidable tragedy. Those former officers have left an indelible stain on the badge of every officer who continues to work toward the betterment of their community every single day. The conduct exhibited is neither taught nor accepted in our profession, and it severely undermines the strides law enforcement agencies across the country have made to earn the trust of their communities. “I commend the immediate action taken by Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo to terminate those officers. Police officers have a foundational duty and responsibility to treat all individuals with dignity, decency and respect, and must be held accountable when they fail in that basic principle of public service. Behavior that does not represent the values of the profession or serve to improve the well-being of the community should never be tolerated. “The Knoxville Police Department will continue to hold its officers to the highest ethical standard, provide the training necessary to ensure the best possible outcome in all scenarios, and work with the community to build and maintain a relationship of trust and mutual understanding.” Excessive use of force is illegal and entirely inconsistent with KPD’s mission to prevent crime and keep the peace. Mayor Kincannon and Chief Thomas say officers will continue to be trained thoroughly in human relations, cultural diversity, ethics in policing and de-escalation tactics, both during the Recruit Academy and throughout their careers. Ongoing training is provided during regular in-service courses and daily squad roll calls as well as through the review, adjustment and enforcement of policies. The addition of body-worn cameras is another tool to help increase transparency and accountability. The money to implement and maintain the cameras was recently approved by City Council. Steps continue to be taken to get the cameras “on the street” as soon as possible. Mayor Kincannon said, “Putting my support behind bodycams was one of my first major actions as Mayor, and I will continue to put public safety as the top priority of my administration. We hear the concerns of our community. Everyone in Knoxville, no matter their skin color, has a right to feel safe and to be treated fairly and humanely.""

1620336680,2020-05-29 14:07:58,Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin arrested in George Floyd's death: Updates,http://rssfeeds.knoxnews.com/~/625487452/0/knoxville/home/~Former-Minneapolis-police-officer-Derek-Chauvin-arrested-in-George-Floyds-death-Updates/,en,False,,89,The Knoxville News Sentinel ,http://www.knoxnews.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS – Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was arrested Friday, days after video circulated of him holding his knee to George Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes before Floyd died. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

The addition of body-worn cameras is another tool to help increase transparency and accountability. The money to implement and maintain the cameras was recently approved by City Council. Steps continue to be taken to get the cameras “on the street” as soon as possible. Mayor Kincannon said, “Putting my support behind bodycams was one of my first major actions as Mayor, and I will continue to put public safety as the top priority of my administration. We hear the concerns of our community. Everyone in Knoxville, no matter their skin color, has a right to feel safe and to be treated fairly and humanely.""

""Every officer in our police department and throughout the country should be emotionally shaken by what has occurred in Minneapolis,"" Metro Nashville Police Department Chief Steve Anderson wrote in a statement. A bystander video of Floyd's death spread quickly on social media this week, showing the former officer, Derek Chauvin, driving his knee into Floyd's neck as the handcuffed man repeatedly said he could not breathe. Chauvin and three other officers involved in the Monday incident have been fired, and on Friday, Chauvin was arrested. The video that circulated showed Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes before he died. Meanwhile, Floyd's death has sparked protests and riots nationwide. Ben Crump, an attorney representing Floyd's family, has called for the arrest of the remaining former officers. The conduct of law enforcement has sparked criticism in the past in Tennessee. Former MNPD Officer Andrew Delke is awaiting trial on a murder charge. Delke, who is white, shot Daniel Hambrick, who was black, three times in the back during a July 2018 foot chase in North Nashville. Activists have cited the 25-year-old's death as a violent example of racial bias on the police force. Delke, 26, is the first Nashville officer ever to be charged with murder after an on-duty shooting. Last summer, U.S. Marshals shot and killed a wanted man in the Frayser neighborhood of Memphis, triggering a violent protest. The man was identified as 20-year-old Brandon Webber. Experts later raised questions about the response of the Memphis Police Department to the protests. Minneapolis officer's actions called 'unconscionable' ""Words cannot adequately express my disdain over the actions that led to the death of George Floyd,"" Anderson wrote. ""The total lack of concern shown by the officer as he continued to hold his knee to the neck of Mr. Floyd as he repeatedly struggled to breathe is unconscionable. Also intolerable is the lack of intervention of the officers who stood there."" Williamson County Sheriff Dusty Rhoades also added his criticism of the situation and the other officers involved. ""The death of George Floyd is wrong in so many ways,"" he told the Tennessean. ""If you're in the law enforcement community and can't see that, you should get the hell out. I don't know what is worse, the rogue cop who was arrested today or the ones who stood by watching and didn't do anything."" Nolensville Police Department Chief Roddy Parker said the situation does not represent the vast majority of officers who love their communities. ""I've watched as life left many people during my career, and this was no easier to watch,"" Parker posted on the department's social media page. ""I saw this I was literally screaming at the TV, 'What the hell are you doing?' George Floyd should not have died this way. This is not the image I want associated with my chosen profession. No officer wants this. George Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck while arresting him.

Sometimes we just need to speak up when something looks or feels wrong, even when it's one of our own. This is where we earn the public trust –– by being real. Sometimes law enforcement make mistakes. Sometimes it's a lack of training. Sometimes we're just plain wrong."" Knoxville Police Department Chief Eve Thomas issued a statement Friday which condemned the actions of the officers involved in Floyd's death and commended Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo in firing them. ""The conduct exhibited is neither taught nor accepted in our profession, and it severely undermines the strides law enforcement agencies across the country have made to earn the trust of their communities,"" Thomas said. ""Police officers have a foundational duty and responsibility to treat all individuals with dignity, decency and respect, and must be held accountable when they fail in that basic principle of public service. Behavior that does not represent the values of the profession or serve to improve the well-being of the community should never be tolerated.""

He emphasized the importance of training law enforcement officers and regularly renewing training. “The only way they’re going to be able to get past it (is with) better training. (We’ll have to) see what pans out with the investigation.” Gallatin Police Chief Don Bandy concurred the use of force was unnecessary and “very inappropriate, in my opinion."" ""It was disheartening to see, especially because there are so many good law enforcement officers out there (who are) really concerned about serving others,"" Bandy said. ""It’s definitely not what we want to see in this profession.” Memphis Police Department Director Michael Rallings joined the chorus of law enforcement who denounced Chauvin's actions. He offered condolences to Floyd's family. ""There is no explanation for what we witnessed in Minneapolis,"" Rallings said in a statement posted to social media. ""The level of force and the disregard of life that was shown sicken me. ""I understand the frustration that many are feeling, and I, too, believe that this incident should be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted by authorities. As a law enforcement officer, we must protect our citizens from harm and crime. If the line is crossed and if an officer becomes a criminal by violating the laws that he or she swore to uphold, that officer must be held accountable.” Clarksville Police Department Chief Al Ansley called what happened to George Floyd ""disgusting"" and said it's something that police and law enforcement supporters everywhere should ""call out"" as unacceptable. ""The tactics used by those officers were not proper tactics, and I don't care whose policy you're looking at, especially our policy,"" he said. Ansley also said that policy includes a prohibition on choke-holds, a responsibility to aid an arrested subject who's in distress and a duty to intervene. He said there are rare situations where it might be appropriate to kneel on a subject, but under no circumstances should an officer kneel on someone's neck. In fact, Ansley said, when a subject is handcuffed, officers have an additional responsibility to ensure that subject's safety. Gov. Lee: Floyd's death 'should be brought to justice' On Thursday, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said the former Minnesota police officers involved in Floyd's death ""should be brought to justice for the loss of that life.""

At least seven people were shot Thursday night in downtown Louisville while others were arrested as hundreds of protesters gathered to demand justice for her death. Police officers did not fire their guns, the LPD spokeswoman Alicia Smiley said.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

At least seven people were shot Thursday night in downtown Louisville while others were arrested as hundreds of protesters gathered to demand justice for her death. Police officers did not fire their guns, the LPD spokeswoman Alicia Smiley said. On Thursday in Memphis, a silent demonstration intended to protest the deaths of Floyd, Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery turned into separate verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters.

""Every officer in our police department and throughout the country should be emotionally shaken by what has occurred in Minneapolis,"" Metro Nashville Police Department Chief Steve Anderson wrote in a statement. A bystander video of Floyd's death spread quickly on social media this week, showing the former officer, Derek Chauvin, driving his knee into Floyd's neck as the handcuffed man repeatedly said he could not breathe. Chauvin and three other officers involved in the Monday incident have been fired, and on Friday, Chauvin was arrested. The video that circulated showed Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes before he died. Meanwhile, Floyd's death has sparked protests and riots nationwide. Ben Crump, an attorney representing Floyd's family, has called for the arrest of the remaining former officers. The conduct of law enforcement has sparked criticism in the past in Tennessee. Former MNPD Officer Andrew Delke is awaiting trial on a murder charge. Delke, who is white, shot Daniel Hambrick, who was black, three times in the back during a July 2018 foot chase in North Nashville. Activists have cited the 25-year-old's death as a violent example of racial bias on the police force. Delke, 26, is the first Nashville officer ever to be charged with murder after an on-duty shooting. Last summer, U.S. Marshals shot and killed a wanted man in the Frayser neighborhood of Memphis, triggering a violent protest. The man was identified as 20-year-old Brandon Webber. Experts later raised questions about the response of the Memphis Police Department to the protests. Minneapolis officer's actions called 'unconscionable' ""Words cannot adequately express my disdain over the actions that led to the death of George Floyd,"" Anderson wrote. ""The total lack of concern shown by the officer as he continued to hold his knee to the neck of Mr. Floyd as he repeatedly struggled to breathe is unconscionable. Also intolerable is the lack of intervention of the officers who stood there."" Williamson County Sheriff Dusty Rhoades also added his criticism of the situation and the other officers involved. ""The death of George Floyd is wrong in so many ways,"" he told the Tennessean. ""If you're in the law enforcement community and can't see that, you should get the hell out. I don't know what is worse, the rogue cop who was arrested today or the ones who stood by watching and didn't do anything."" Nolensville Police Department Chief Roddy Parker said the situation does not represent the vast majority of officers who love their communities. ""I've watched as life left many people during my career, and this was no easier to watch,"" Parker posted on the department's social media page. ""I saw this I was literally screaming at the TV, 'What the hell are you doing?' George Floyd should not have died this way. This is not the image I want associated with my chosen profession. No officer wants this. George Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck while arresting him.

Sometimes we just need to speak up when something looks or feels wrong, even when it's one of our own. This is where we earn the public trust –– by being real. Sometimes law enforcement make mistakes. Sometimes it's a lack of training. Sometimes we're just plain wrong."" Knoxville Police Department Chief Eve Thomas issued a statement Friday which condemned the actions of the officers involved in Floyd's death and commended Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo in firing them. ""The conduct exhibited is neither taught nor accepted in our profession, and it severely undermines the strides law enforcement agencies across the country have made to earn the trust of their communities,"" Thomas said. ""Police officers have a foundational duty and responsibility to treat all individuals with dignity, decency and respect, and must be held accountable when they fail in that basic principle of public service. Behavior that does not represent the values of the profession or serve to improve the well-being of the community should never be tolerated."" Cheatham County Sheriff Mike Breedlove called the video disturbing and said the type of restraint used “was very problematic.""

(Photo: Darnella Frazier Via Storyful) “He’s complying,” Breedlove said of what he saw in the video of Floyd. “Bottom line (is), there must be some lack of training up there,” Breedlove said. He emphasized the importance of training law enforcement officers and regularly renewing training. “The only way they’re going to be able to get past it (is with) better training. (We’ll have to) see what pans out with the investigation.” Gallatin Police Chief Don Bandy concurred the use of force was unnecessary and “very inappropriate, in my opinion."" ""It was disheartening to see, especially because there are so many good law enforcement officers out there (who are) really concerned about serving others,"" Bandy said. ""It’s definitely not what we want to see in this profession.” Memphis Police Department Director Michael Rallings joined the chorus of law enforcement who denounced Chauvin's actions. He offered condolences to Floyd's family. ""There is no explanation for what we witnessed in Minneapolis,"" Rallings said in a statement posted to social media. ""The level of force and the disregard of life that was shown sicken me. ""I understand the frustration that many are feeling, and I, too, believe that this incident should be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted by authorities. As a law enforcement officer, we must protect our citizens from harm and crime. If the line is crossed and if an officer becomes a criminal by violating the laws that he or she swore to uphold, that officer must be held accountable.” Clarksville Police Department Chief Al Ansley called what happened to George Floyd ""disgusting"" and said it's something that police and law enforcement supporters everywhere should ""call out"" as unacceptable. ""The tactics used by those officers were not proper tactics, and I don't care whose policy you're looking at, especially our policy,"" he said. Ansley also said that policy includes a prohibition on choke-holds, a responsibility to aid an arrested subject who's in distress and a duty to intervene. He said there are rare situations where it might be appropriate to kneel on a subject, but under no circumstances should an officer kneel on someone's neck. In fact, Ansley said, when a subject is handcuffed, officers have an additional responsibility to ensure that subject's safety. Gov. Lee: Floyd's death 'should be brought to justice' On Thursday, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said the former Minnesota police officers involved in Floyd's death ""should be brought to justice for the loss of that life."" Earlier this week, a police officer in Greenbrier, Tennessee, resigned after he was placed on leave because of a profanity-laced Facebook comment referencing the death of George Floyd. The officer later resigned. The city of Greenbrier confirmed that following the closed investigation, former Officer Cory Tidwell, ""was extremely apologetic and remorseful for any embarrassment he caused the City of Greenbrier and Greenbrier Police Department."" According to several screen captures, Tidwell wrote, without naming Floyd, ""If he was begging...HE WAS F---ING BREATHING STUPID F---S!!!!!!!!!....same old bulls--- over and over and over...""

This time instead of protesting on Union Avenue they marched past the world famous bars and restaurants along Beale Street. Local pastor and activist Devante Hill was among the dozens demonstrating. “Tonight we are talking about injustice that comes from behind the badge. I’ve been a victim of it so many times. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been pulled over, thrown in the back of a car in this city and let go.” Also out Thursday night was tourist Matt Barbour and his family. “Last night was kind of spooky, it was disturbing,” Barbour said. “We are here to have fun and to enjoy ourselves.” Instead he found himself captivated by the crowd of protestors. Though unsettling at times, he said it’s still understandable. “It appears that people do have racial tension and they should when people are being treated unfairly,” he said. Barbour said he is certainly compassionate for those who are demonstrating. He also added he’s hopeful things will get back to normal along the iconic Beale Street. “Hopefully we will get through this, and will get better.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, after the office gathered enough evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Freeman did not have immediate details, but said a criminal complaint would be made available later. The charges come after three days of protests, which had been escalating in violence. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The police officer seen on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in custody after pleading that he could not breathe, was arrested Friday after three days of often-violent protests that resulted in looting across parts of Minneapolis. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said state investigators arrested Derek Chauvin, who was one of four officers fired this week, but he did not provide details. The state attorney who would oversee any prosecution on state charges, whose home was also the site of protests, was scheduled to provide an update later Friday. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the ""abject failure"" of the response to this week's protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state would take over the response to the protests and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said, adding. ""Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching."" The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district ""on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" which prompted a warning from Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard's mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources ""never came,"" he said. ""You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,"" Walz said. On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street, doing what they could to help. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention. ""I can't believe this is happening here,"" he said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd's death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis ""under control,"" calling the protesters ""thugs"" and tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform's rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the ""total lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: ""What's the plan here?"" ""With regard to?"" Frey responded. Then he added: ""There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable."" He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were ""clearing the streets and restoring order,"" and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were ""a clear violation of their First Amendment rights."" Walz publicly apologized on Friday. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing members of Floyd's family, called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd's body to have an independent autopsy performed. Floyd said that talk of a heart condition or asthma are irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner as well. Minutes after the precinct burned on Thursday, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd's death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: ""Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?"" In a follow-up tweet, he said he ""didn't see anything unreasonable."" The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk"" and said he was ""not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd's death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said that Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it's not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events that featured African-American music, Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press. Santamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, ""he might have given him a little more mercy."" Santamaria, who sold the venue within the past two months, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified ""overkill.""",0.0

Floyd's death has sparked days of protests in Minneapolis. President Trump blamed the unrest on ""thugs"" in a tweet that was later hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" Read Obama's full statement below, including a reference to a viral video of a song by Keedron Bryant, who pleads, ""I just want to live, God protect me."" I want to share parts of the conversations I've had with friends over the past couple days about the footage of George Floyd dying face down on the street under the knee of a police officer in Minnesota. The first is an email from a middle-aged African American businessman. ""Dude I gotta tell you the George Floyd incident in Minnesota hurt. I cried when I saw that video. It broke me down. The 'knee on the neck' is a metaphor for how the system so cavalierly holds black folks down, ignoring the cries for help. People don't care. Truly tragic."" Another friend of mine used the powerful song that went viral from 12-year-old Keedron Bryant to describe the frustrations he was feeling. The circumstances of my friend and Keedron may be different, but their anguish is the same. It's shared by me and millions of others. It's natural to wish for life ""to just get back to normal"" as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly ""normal"" — whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park. This shouldn't be ""normal"" in 2020 America. It can't be ""normal."" If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better. It will fall mainly on the officials of Minnesota to ensure that the circumstances surrounding George Floyd's death are investigated thoroughly and that justice is ultimately done. But it falls on all of us, regardless of our race or station — including the majority of men and women in law enforcement who take pride in doing their tough job the right way, every day — to work together to create a ""new normal"" in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.

Bill Lee condemns police brutality after Memphis protest,https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/local/2020/05/28/george-floyd-death-tennessee-governor-bill-lee-condemns-police-brutality-after-memphis-protest/5278419002/,en,False,,658835,State News - United States - Tennessee,http://www.tennessee.statenews.net/,"CLOSE During Gov. Bill Lee's COVID-19 press briefing he spoke on recent incidents of police brutality around the country. Nashville Tennessean Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect comments from U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said Thursday the former Minnesota police officers involved in the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis on Monday, ""should be brought to justice for the loss of that life."" During his weekly COVID-19 news conference, Lee, a Tennessee Republican, condemned police brutality and said he spoke about the issue with leaders of Tennessee's African American community as well as law enforcement. He did not specify who was part of those conversations. His remarks came after a week of protests across the U.S. about the deaths of black Americans, including a demonstration in Memphis Wednesday evening that lasted into the wee hours of Thursday morning. Throughout the day Friday, other leaders also voiced their disgust over Floyd's death. ""In our conversations, we all agreed that the situation there represents a very disturbing trend across the country ... and that we have to be committed to recognizing and calling out police brutality where it exists,"" Lee said. ""I have a great deal of respect for and have long supported law enforcement and continue to do so ... but police brutality is not law enforcement."" Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin pins George Floyd to the ground on May 25. Floyd later died. Chauvin was fired the next day. (Photo: Darnella Frazier via Storyful) ""Police brutality should not be accepted in this state and it shouldn't be tolerated,"" Lee continued. ""I don't believe we should or will tolerate it in the days ahead. It's unacceptable."" The governor did not address the protest in Memphis specifically. That protest, which at its peak attracted more than 100 protesters and Memphis police in riot gear, blocked traffic on Union Avenue in Midtown Memphis for hours. It came the same night that some of the widespread protests in Minneapolis ended in violence and property damage. George Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. (Photo: Photo courtesy of the Floyd family) Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland also condemned the actions of the four officers involved in Minneapolis on Thursday and said ""all true police officers"" felt the same. He also criticized the protesters for not observing social distancing during a pandemic, saying they put themselves and Memphis Police Department personnel at risk of contracting COVID-19. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for Derek Chauvin, the former officer who knelt on Floyd's neck as the man cried out for breath, to be arrested, according the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. On Friday, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen expressed his disgust for how Floyd died and said the United States needs to change and that Congress should act. ""Congress must act to address the unfair treatment of African Americans in their interactions with police,"" Cohen said. ""The recent outrageous mishandling of the Ahmaud Arbery murder case in Georgia, the police shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville and the videotaped asphyxiation of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer are just the most recent examples of an injustice African Americans have endured for centuries. It’s long past time to stop talking and act."" Natalie Allison contributed to this story.

We'll have more in a second on a controversial, since-deleted tweet from Memphis Tigers basketball player Lance Thomas, and on YMCA expanding free child care for essential workers. But first... Moved by the horrifying images of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, protesters last night sat on Beale Street and imagined not being able to breathe. The peaceful demonstration, which drew about 60 protesters, was the second in as many nights against police brutality, our Micaela Watts and Laura Testino report. Unlike at the previous night's protest, which briefly closed Union Avenue in Midtown, no racist counter-protesters showed up and the police presence was noticeably less pronounced. Officers didn't don riot gear — or violently shove a woman to the ground in a clear case of excessive force that should mean disciplinary action for the officer. Buy Photo Protesters gathering along Beale Street in Downtown Memphis speaking out against police brutality for the second night in a row on Thursday, May 28, 2020. (Photo: Joe Rondone/The Commercial Appeal) Yesterday, after the pepper spray had cleared, the Shelby County Democratic Party and several elected officials criticized Memphis police for knocking over the woman and for arresting at least five people. One of those was Rep. G.A. Hardaway, D-Memphis: ""They (police officers) were out of line last night, and I'm being kind when I say that,"" said Hardaway, who did not attend the protest, noting a moment when a member of MPD used a riot shield and knocked a woman over. But the criticism flowed both ways yesterday, if not with equal force. Like Gov. Bill Lee, Mayor Jim Strickland said he was angered by what happened to Floyd, but Strickland also took protesters to task for not wearing masks or maintaining safe social distance, our Sam Hardiman reports. Last night, most protesters seemed to be wearing masks. Pause for a second and let it sink in that this is what Memphians are talking about. Not all protests are made equal, and the protests Memphis has seen these past two nights have been the right kind — unlike what's happening in Minneapolis right now. The wrong kind returns hate for hate and violence for violence, giving outlet to the darkest parts of human nature; it loots and burns because its aim is to destroy and not to heal. Thank God these two protests in Memphis don't fit that description. The question now is whether the next protest in Memphis, whenever it is, will be the right kind. To that end, Memphis police have to hold officers to a higher standard, not relax them, and swiftly and appropriately punish any officers who cross the lines. But protest organizers also have a responsibility to set the tone of demonstrations. Stop giving microphones to people who are foolish enough to indiscriminately hate police. Keeping Memphis from going up in flames like Minneapolis will require people of conscience on both sides of the barricades to work for the good of their city. Who's silencing Tigers' Lance Thomas? Memphis Tigers basketball player Lance Thomas took a controversial stand on Twitter Wednesday after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, our Evan Barnes reports. Here's the tweet, which he quickly deleted: ""Not even going to lie. I’m never pledging allegiance to the American Flag before any of my games or anywhere I’m at ever again. I refuse to pledge allegiance to a country that practices killing black people for sport."" He followed up with an apology: To anyone who took any offense to my tweet that wasn’t the intention at all but let’s take a look at the injustice at hand smh🤦🏾‍♂️ — Lance Thomas (@Lancegreek) May 27, 2020 Whether he stands or kneels is his personal choice, and should be left entirely up to him. But not everyone feels the same way, based on a follow-up tweet in which he said someone — he didn't say who — made him delete his original tweet: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂made me take it down — Lance Thomas (@Lancegreek) May 27, 2020 Was it a relative? The school? His coach? It's unclear, but our Jason Munz spoke with Memphis athletic director Laird Veatch, who generally expressed support for Thomas. YMCA expands free child care program Starting Monday, the YMCA of Memphis and the Mid-South will offer free child care to ""essential"" workers at eight Memphis community centers, our Laura Testino reports. That's an expansion of the YMCA's existing free child care program, which currently consists of 700 children of essential workers at 18 YMCAs.

There have been 109 deaths in Shelby County from COVID-19 complications. Statewide, there were 23,006 reported COVID-19 cases on Sunday, up from 22,566 reported cases Saturday, per the state health department. Of the 23,006 cases, 15,300 people have recovered. The health department reported 364 deaths statewide. Over 5,000 cases of COVID-19 reported in Shelby County The Shelby County Health Department reported 5,003 COVID-19 cases Sunday — a 95 cases increase from the previous day. No new deaths were reported since Saturday, leaving the number of deaths at 109. As of Sunday morning, there are 1,452 active cases, and 3,442 people have recovered from the novel coronavirus. In the county, over 73,300 people have been tested for COVID-19. All inmates at 201 Poplar have now recovered from COVID-19, SCSO says All 160 inmates at the 201 Poplar Ave. facility who tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered, the Shelby County Sheriff's Office said Friday. The Shelby County Health Department defines recoveries as: “People who are living and have been confirmed to be asymptomatic by the health department and have completed their required isolation period” or “Are at least 21 days beyond the first test confirming their illness.” With 1,867 total inmates, the 201 Poplar Ave. facility is at 67% capacity, John Morris, public information officer for SCSO, said in the video update Friday. Jails, much like long-term care facilities, have been identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as places where the probability of contracting infectious diseases increases significantly compared to other housing. Lawsuit: ACLU sues to force Shelby County Sheriff to release inmates most at risk for COVID-19 One additional SCSO employee tested positive this week, making a total of 69 employees testing positive for COVID-19, Morris said. Of those, 48 have recovered and one is hospitalized. The department previously reported that one of its employees died of COVID-19 complications. There are currently no reported cases of COVID-19 among the 164 inmates at Jail East or the 45 youth at Juvenile Court detention center, SCSO said. Both facilities are operating at 44% and 33% capacity, respectively. Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris has said that in partnership with the state, the county organized surge testing for the 201 Poplar facility and “will do even more.” Plans are also being made to do surge testing at the Shelby County penal farm in coming weeks. All inmates and staff will be offered tests, he has said. Strickland suggests increasing daily COVID-19 testing capacity to 30,000 Memphis could test up to 30,000 people per day for COVID-19, if the city follows the suggestion from Mayor Jim Strickland and Dr. Manoj Jain, who is the infectious disease expert helping lead the region's medical response to the virus. The plan was presented during the city council's budget hearing. The suggestion represents a significant increase in daily tests. Memphis has reported a total of 70,000 tests since the virus reached the region in March, according to the Shelby County Health Department. Data shows that daily testing numbers fluctuate, usually landing between 1,000 and 1,800 in the last two weeks. ""Large scale testing will allow the safer reopening of ours schools, businesses, and increased testing in underserved communities,"" Strickland wrote in his weekly update. The daily tests would be administered to people regardless of symptoms. Memphis set aside $12 million in fedear Act funding to scale up, Strickland said. Friday, he and Jain asked that $1 million be used to build the infrastructure for such testing. This would include a voluntary pilot program with city employees, set to begin in June, he wrote. ""If we’re successful, Memphis will create the blueprint to grow testing in other cities across the country, and once again, lead as a city that continues to change the world,"" Strickland wrote. Shelby Co. inmates make face masks Prisoners at the Shelby County Division of Corrections are now making face masks for distribution to needy people in the community, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris said in a memo to constituents Friday. “Over 2,000 masks have already been manufactured,” he wrote. “As a result, we have been able to deliver masks for free to our partners at Agape, which serves thousands of children and families in our community. “We’ve provided masks to HopeWorks, which specializes in re-entry and putting ex-offenders back on track. We’ve also donated masks to YMCA childcare centers, who are providing free childcare to our essential workers at several locations across our community, and the Shelby County Office of Re-Entry, which provides community services to individuals returning to our community from incarceration. “This program not only produces masks for our community but allows inmates to learn a new skill, earn good behavior credit, and contribute to our fight against the novel coronavirus.” The memo also said that only five prisoners at the prison have been tested for the virus. One has tested positive. Prisons, jails and immigration detention centers have become hot spots for the virus. In late April, mass testing at the county jail at 201 Poplar Ave. in Memphis found 155 detainees were positive for the virus, as were 37 jail employees. The local advocacy group Memphis Interfaith Coalition for Action and Hope, or MICAH, has pressed for additional testing at the separate county prison, sometimes called the penal farm. “We are working with state officials to plan for a testing surge at the penal farm,” Harris wrote. “During the surge, all inmates and staff at the penal farm will be offered a test.” Frayser-based group to offer mental health resources to children, families Families and children in Memphis can access free mental health check-ins beginning next week. Legacy of Legends, a group dedicated to preventing adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), is hosting the services. Check-in services include ACE and clinical assessments, family support specialists, community support and free groceries. The free services begin June 2 and will continue on Tuesdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and Thursdays from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Events will take place at 2025 Clifton Ave. To comply with social distancing guidelines, no more than 50 people will be at the facility at one time. Children, ages 5 to 17, must attend the sessions with parents. To reserve a spot, register online at www.legacyoflegendscfc.com.

Free testing event this afternoon on Summer Avenue; no symptoms required A free testing event for the novel coronavirus takes place Friday afternoon — today —from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. at St. Michael Catholic Church church at 3863 Summer Avenue, the Shelby County Health Department posted on Twitter.

Thursday, Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer and other leaders held a press conference and called out MPD’s excessive use of force and asked for the release of arrested protesters.  At least five protesters were arrested as a result of the demonstration that shut down Union Avenue in response to the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, after the office gathered enough evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Freeman did not have immediate details, but said a criminal complaint would be made available later. The charges come after three days of protests, which had been escalating in violence. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The police officer seen on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in custody after pleading that he could not breathe, was arrested Friday after three days of often-violent protests that resulted in looting across parts of Minneapolis. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said state investigators arrested Derek Chauvin, who was one of four officers fired this week, but he did not provide details. The state attorney who would oversee any prosecution on state charges, whose home was also the site of protests, was scheduled to provide an update later Friday. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the ""abject failure"" of the response to this week's protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state would take over the response to the protests and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said, adding. ""Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching."" The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district ""on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" which prompted a warning from Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard's mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources ""never came,"" he said. ""You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,"" Walz said. On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street, doing what they could to help. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention. ""I can't believe this is happening here,"" he said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd's death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis ""under control,"" calling the protesters ""thugs"" and tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform's rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the ""total lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: ""What's the plan here?"" ""With regard to?"" Frey responded. Then he added: ""There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable."" He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were ""clearing the streets and restoring order,"" and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were ""a clear violation of their First Amendment rights."" Walz publicly apologized on Friday. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing members of Floyd's family, called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd's body to have an independent autopsy performed. Floyd said that talk of a heart condition or asthma are irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner as well. Minutes after the precinct burned on Thursday, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd's death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: ""Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?"" In a follow-up tweet, he said he ""didn't see anything unreasonable."" The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk"" and said he was ""not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd's death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said that Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it's not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events that featured African-American music, Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press. Santamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, ""he might have given him a little more mercy."" Santamaria, who sold the venue within the past two months, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified ""overkill.""",0.0
1620443960,2020-05-29 00:00:00,Trump adds fuel to protest fires with denounced tweet,http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/Nation/2020/05/29/Trump-adds-fuel-to-protest-fires-with-denounced-tweet.html,en,False,,94065,johnsoncitypress.com,http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/#spider,"“When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump wrote in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence.” The White House said the president “did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it.” Trump’s comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, capping three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. The president’s reaction — a day after he had decried Floyd’s treatment and vowed justice for his family — underscored Trump’s complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order” mantle while also trying to build his appeal among black voters during an election year. And it highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department’s efforts to “combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.” In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful “because I’ve let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “We don’t mind being accused of police brutality,” he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. The White House did not respond to questions about where Trump had heard the phrase and what he meant by it. But Trump said Friday afternoon that he’d been trying to say that, “Looting leads to shooting.” “I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means,” he tweeted. “It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement. It’s very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media. Honor the memory of George Floyd!” But criticism was nonetheless swift. “It’s not helpful,” said Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, during a news briefing Friday. “Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.” Trump’s presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden said it was “no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.” And Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed the chance to help the public cope with “two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.” Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky did not address Trump’s tweets but decried the recent deaths of African Americans as “the latest disturbing chapters in our long, unfinished American struggle to ensure that equal justice under law is not conditional on the color of one’s skin.” He also said, “Stealing, burning down buildings, attacking law enforcement officers or laying siege to police precincts is not speech or protest. It is violent crime that victimizes innocent people.” Twitter’s action Friday morning marked the second time this week that the social media giant has flagged the president’s content, this time adding a warning label that prevented it from being shared or liked. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, thus accusing the White House of promoting violence. Floyd’s death and fury it has sparked are set against the backdrop of a heated presidential election and competing political priorities for the president. Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump — who rarely holds his tongue — has been silent in the face a long list of high-profile police-involved killings of black men, including Eric Garner, who died after being placed in a chokehold by police and whose dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) Since even before his 2016 campaign, Trump has portrayed himself as a staunch defender of law and order. He has often spoken in front of law enforcement groups, and in one speech appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after his presumptive Democratic opponent, former Vice President Biden, suggested last week that black voters who support Trump “ain’t black.” A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference — and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president’s charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign’s plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Trump’s back-and-forth with Twitter comes a day after he signed an executive order challenging the site’s protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The company said it had flagged Trump’s latest tweet “in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts,” but kept it accessible to users because they felt it was “important that the public still be able to see the Tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance.” Supporters of the president balked at the move. “It seems like they’re carrying out a vendetta against the president,” Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 2 GOP House leader, said on Fox News Friday.",0.0

Freeman did not provide immediate details, but said a criminal complaint would be made available later Friday and that more charges were possible. In the video, Chauvin is seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck as Floyd is on the ground. He gradually becomes motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignore bystanders’ shouts to get off him. Freeman said the investigation continues into the other three officers, but that authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Freeman highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd’s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video by a bystander. He said he would not bring a case unless he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Protests in Minneapolis escalated in violence on Thursday, when demonstrators torched a police station that officers had abandoned. “I’m not insensitive to what happened in the streets,” Freeman said. “My own home has been picketed regularly.” All four officers who were at the scene of Floyd’s death were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside the government center chanted, “All four got to go.” News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state would take over the response to the violence and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district “on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen.” His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said. “You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street, doing what they could to help. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention. “I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Walz publicly apologized on Friday. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing members of Floyd’s family, called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd’s body to have an independent autopsy performed. Floyd said that talk of a heart condition or asthma is irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police.

Elaine Lee Turner is a civil rights activist who marched, protested and picketed in places like Memphis and Selma, Alabama. She was arrested multiple times in her fight against social injustice. “I see déjà vu. You know, the same thing happening all over again from the 1960’s,” Turner said. As that fight continues now, she does notice a key difference. “Now it’s being filmed,” Turner said. “It’s on video. Now people can see what we have seen all of these years.” Turner says that’s one of the reasons buildings are burning in Minnesota. “It represents over 400 years of oppression of built up anger, of built up frustration and nobody is listening,” Turner said. These are discussions Dr. Martin Luther King Jr brought up more than 50 years ago. While the approach may have differed, his fight was the same. “He knew that when there was violence then the issue took a sideline because folks were focused on the violence and that’s what’s happening right now,” said Faith Morris with the National Civil Rights Museum. And keeping the focus where it belongs is why younger activists like Devante Hill says he has an obligation to organize protests and speak up. “I think it’s our time to pick up that torch Dr. King wanted to ignite here in this city, for Memphis to be the catalyst of that change in a non-violent way that also still participates and believes in social disobedience,” Hill said. “I applaud these young people,” Turner said. “I encourage them to yes please keep up the fight. The mantle has been passed to you and it’s not over.” Organizers say they’ve been encouraged by the diversity of people participating in this week’s protests. They hope that continues with another peaceful protest outside FedEx Forum Friday night at 6:30 pm.",0.0

(May 29) AP Domestic Clarksville Police Chief Al Ansley called the Minneapolis killing of George Floyd at the hands of police ""disgusting"" and said it's something that police and law enforcement supporters everywhere should ""call out"" as unacceptable. Ansley, who is retiring June 30 after 33 years on the force, 13 of those as chief, said the the four Minneapolis officers don't represent all police, and that's why police need to condemn their actions. ""When something like this happens — and I go back to Rodney King — this is the one profession in which when somebody ... does something egregious, we are all clumped into the same pot, and that's not the case here,"" Ansley said in an interview with The Leaf-Chronicle. Chief Al Ansley (Photo: contributed) ""Every officer — I don't care what rank you are from chief down to a patrol officer — you cannot look at that video and say that those officers were in the right."" That includes those who stood by and didn't act, Ansley said, emphasizing an officer's duty to intervene. All of the officers were fired quickly. Officer Derek Chauvin has since been arrested, and Ansley supports that when officers step outside the law. ""Going back to Charleston, South Carolina, when an individual was shot running from a traffic stop, that officer needs to be incarcerated, no question,"" he said. ""A lot of people think we protect each other, and we do, we back each other up. But when we see something, whether it's in this department or another one, we need to call it out when it's inappropriate."" Hundreds of people gathered in Foley Square in lower Manhattan May 29, 2020 to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis earlier this week. (Photo: Seth Harrison/The Journal News) He said that within CPD, and he's been with the department for 33 years, they've worked hard to change the climate, and it starts with hiring and staffing. ""If you've got problems, get rid of them. And I think we've done some of that through the years. We don't retain officers that would react in the manner that these officers did. We get rid of them, that's the bottom line. Nobody wants to work with a bad officer, regardless of what people think. Nobody, most of all us,"" Ansley said.

Floyd, who said he couldn't breathe, later died. (Photo: Darnella Frazier Via Storyful) Specifically, Ansley said that while he's only seen the same footage everyone else has, and he hasn't had access, for example, to body camera footage, what he's seen shows several violations of typical police policies. ""The tactics used by those officers were not proper tactics, and I don't care whose policy you're looking at, especially our policy."" He said the Clarksville policy includes a prohibition on chokeholds, a responsibility to aid an arrested subject who's in distress, and a duty to intervene. There are rare situations where it might be appropriate to kneel on a subject, but under no circumstances should an officer kneel on someone's neck. In fact, Ansley said, when a subject is handcuffed, officers have an additional responsibility to ensure that subject's safety. ""Any police officer that would support this kind of behavior does not need to wear a badge."" Changing the culture at CPD Ansley said he and other leaders have been working for many years to change the culture of the Clarksville Police Department, which was once the subject of several high-profile racial discrimination lawsuits. Buy Photo Clarksville Police Chief Al Ansley (Photo: Stephanie Ingersoll/The Leaf-Chronicle) ""Back then, things were very different from the way they are now,"" he said. Today, officers are brought in with a new set of expectations for the responsibility they're being entrusted with. ""This is a job you have to want to do, and you have to want to do it for the right reasons. It's not us vs. them,"" he said, expressing frustration with the popular ""Thin Blue Line"" way of thinking that suggests a divided community. ""It's not us vs. them — it's us. We are the community; we are part of this community."" To build up that community connection, he said it's important to understand and to listen to everyone, and to reach out to create conversations. ""We try our best to do that, but we should never sit on our hands and be satisfied, we should continue to do that."" That improved culture will continue with the next police chief, now-Deputy Chief David Crockarell, Ansley said, and the hiring of Crockarell, an internal candidate, demonstrates the confidence the City Council has in the local police force. Adapting to changes The CPD policies, which many years ago allowed choke-holds, for example, are regularly reviewed and changed when needed. ""If we see something that needs to change, we change it,"" Ansley said. The implementation of a Clarksville Police body camera system last year is are a good example of that, he said. ""No one told us to go after that; we went after that on our own."" CPD first applied for a grant for body cameras in 2015, and now all the officers wear them. ""And our officers have accepted body cameras; a lot of them said they wouldn't want to leave home without it. ""That's the kind of officer were putting on the street today.""

1620563980,2020-05-29 20:29:24,Live updates: George Floyd protests grow in cities across the U.S.,https://www.wate.com/news/live-updates-george-floyd-protests-grow-in-cities-across-the-u-s/,en,False,,84580,wate.com,http://www.wate.com/#spider,"ATLANTA (AP) — Demonstrators marched, stopped traffic and in some cases lashed out violently at police as protests erupted Friday in dozens of U.S. cities following the killing of George Floyd after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted ”“No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “Quit your jobs.” At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said in an emailed statement. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Demonstrators ignored police demands to disperse. Some protesters moved to the city’s major interstate thoroughfare to try to block traffic. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.” “You are disgracing our city,” she told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.” Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King’s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. “We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. In Minneapolis, a curfew did little to stop protesters and others from gathering in several areas of the city, including the battered Lake Street neighborhood where a police precinct was burned the night before. There were scattered small fires and some stores in a strip mall were being broken into near the city’s 5th Precinct. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to take away prisoners. “We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. “Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd. Jimmy Ohaz, 19, came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more?

The agency, which typically patrols the nation’s border and ports of entry, said the drone was going to provide live video to assist law enforcement in Minneapolis as they responded to protests that have left dozens of stores burned and looted. A CBP statement issued Friday says the drone would have provided “situational awareness” to local law enforcement. It said it routinely conducts such operations if needed to help other agencies or during natural disasters. The drone returned to its base in Grand Forks, North Dakota, after “the requesting agency determined that the aircraft was no longer needed for operational awareness.” CBP did not identify the agency that requested the assistance. 7:52 p.m. CNN Center in Atlanta Police cars getting literally destroyed in Atlanta outside the CNN Center pic.twitter.com/x5zRxZVQpb — Fernando Alfonso III (@fernalfonso) May 29, 2020 SWAT pushing in in ATL, CNN Center vandalized and has had windows smashed pic.twitter.com/EgMrEaYCTB — intelwave ⚓️ (@inteldotwav) May 29, 2020 Atlanta protesters burn American flag in front of CNN Center #GeorgeFloyddeath pic.twitter.com/89FLqW0GYt — ivan (@ivan8848) May 29, 2020 7:41 p.m. New York City protesters reach CNN The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0

The first demonstrators arrived just before 6:30 p.m. Within an hour, the crowd had grown to about 300, the largest of the protests so far. That was despite a series of road closures set up by the Memphis Police Department at every entrance into the area. Friday's gathering had a decidedly different energy than the previous days. On Wednesday, the overarching emotion seemed to be anger. Friday night's protest seemed to be about unity and healing. Rather than one person leading call-and-response style chants, Memphis pastor and activist DeVante Hill shared his megaphone, giving anyone who wanted to a chance to address the crowd. Some people shared stories about their own interactions with police. One woman sang to the crowd. One man simply asked the crowd to say out loud that Black Lives Matter. Night #3 I was a touch late, the main arteries that lead to FedExForum have been blocked by PST cars. In spite of that, a considerable number of folks, >100 are present at the forum. pic.twitter.com/hz9CNvROIC — Micaela Watts〽️ (@megawatts2000) May 30, 2020 Other than the roadblock, no Memphis police were present. One of the speakers was Tre Black, who was arrested during Wednesday's protest along Union Avenue, one of the five detained, according to the MPD. “Police brutality is not the disease,” Black said to the crowd. “It is a symptom” of an inequitable justice system. Hill spoke in support of Black's willingness to attend another protest. “Every great leader has a mugshot,” he said, adding that Black was now an activist forever. After more than an hour listening to one another speak in turn, the crowed walked together around 8:15 p.m. They walked to the intersection of Beale Street and B.B. King Boulevard and blocked the intersection for nine minutes, one for each minute Floyd spent repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe before his death. At least two minutes were spent kneeling as Hill described what Floyd may have been thinking as he died. As protesters knelt, the MPD released a video of Police Director Mike Rallings expressing anger over Floyd's death, but warning against looting and violence. ""Memphians have proven to the world that peaceful protests can happen. Voices can be heard, but don't let national and local news stories and social media drive us in anger to destroy our beautiful city. We can get through this together,"" Rallings said. ""We will respect and welcome the expression of the First Amendment rights to all citizens in a law-abiding manner, but we need everyone's help to maintain peace."" By 9 p.m. the crowd had walked peacefully to the front door of City Hall. There were enough protesters to stretch from one end to the other of each city block as they walked the one mile from FedExForum to City Hall. As they stood together in the dark, they chanted ""The people united will never be divided!"" The group walked past the county building back to B.B. King Boulevard, past FedExForum, through South City eventually stopping at the National Civil Rights Museum. Outside the room where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, the crowd sat on the ground covering most of the paved walkway leading to the museum's doors and listened to each other share. ""This is not a political movement,"" Hill said. ""This is a people movement."" A timeline of protests in Memphis In Memphis, a silent demonstration Wednesday intended to protest the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery turned into separate verbal confrontations with Memphis police and two counter-protesters. The feel of a Thursday night demonstration was different than the night before: No counter-protesters appeared and the police presence was less pronounced. By Friday morning, Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland called for an investigation of police actions during the protest on Union Avenue. The statement was an apparent reference to a video that showed a police officer with a riot shield knocking down a woman. The protest that began Wednesday night extended until after 1 a.m. once MPD brought out barricades between protesters and its officer who were silently standing dressed in riot gear. In the aftermath of Wednesday's protest, activists, community leaders and the Shelby County Democratic Party criticized the MPD and Strickland. They questioned why MPD allowed the two counter-protesters to use racial slurs (epithets were also hurled at police), and why three of those arrested were still in the Shelby County jail on misdemeanor charges when the site is among the known outbreaks of COVID-19 in Shelby County. The protest, which lasted for hours, came at a time when groups of more than 50 are forbidden in Memphis and Shelby County unless there's a clear social distancing plan. The group of activists and officials expressed concern about Strickland’s criticism of protesters for forgoing social distancing guidelines and placing themselves and the police at risk of COVID-19. Educator Ayo Akinmoladun, one of the organizers, said the demonstration started with observation of social distancing guidelines. Wednesday: 'Stop killing black people': Demonstration closes Union Avenue as protesters face off with counter-protesters, MPD Thursday: County, state officials criticize Memphis Police Department, administration's response to protest Thursday: Protesters gather against police brutality for a second night in Memphis Friday: Mayor Strickland calls for investigation of police actions during Memphis protest Memphis protests join demonstrations nationwide Demonstrators have gathered in cities across the country this week to demand justice for Floyd and other victims of racial injustice, including most recently Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. Floyd died Monday after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes after Floyd was restrained. The police department said they responded to a ""forgery in progress,"" found a suspect and ordered the suspect to get out of his vehicle. The four officers involved in the incident have been fired. Minneapolis police identified the officers Wednesday as Derek Chauvin — the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck — Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for Chauvin to be arrested. After several nights of protests, Chauvin was arrested Friday, days after video circulated of him holding his knee to Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes before Floyd died.

(WJHL) — For the second day, protesters gathered outside of the Johnson City Municipal and Public Safety Building in response to the death of George Floyd, who died in the custody of Minneapolis police. Dozens rallied in the parking lot before moving to the sidewalks along East Main Street. “Although it didn’t happen here, when we do something here it just shows that we’re all united no matter what state that we’re in,” said protester Yudehwheh Gbaa. Friday night’s group stemmed from Thursday’s Black Lives Matter rally tripling in size. “I pray that they see our perspective. They see the perspective of a person of color that we have fought for years and years and years just to be heard that ‘Hey, we pose no threat to anyone,'” said protester Thameena Giturwa. Word of the protest spread across social media. RELATED » Fired police officer Derek Chauvin charged with murder in George Floyd’s death “I was just watching the news and seeing the news and I just got sick of the fact that people we’re still trying to defend people who are racist,” said organizer Abigayle Cowden. “I told all my friends ‘We need to do something… have a protest.. just show our love and support so people know not everybody thinks this way and it is not okay to think that way.'” Those who participated hope to bring light to racism and injustice everywhere- even if those situations aren’t prominent in the Tri-Cities. “We know Johnson City is a safe place, I love Johnson City but we want to get the message out there that all police officers should know and treat us equally as everyone else,” Gbaa said. A group of community leaders plan to gather at the Johnson City Safety and Municipal Building for a prayer vigil and demonstration of community unity Saturday night at 6 p.m. RELATED » Local police speak out against actions of former Minneapolis police officer",0.0

Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the ""abject failure"" of the response to this week's violent protests and called for swift justice for police involved in the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said, adding. ""Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching."" The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district ""on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" which prompted a warning from Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard's mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources ""never came,"" he said. ""You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,"" Walz said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd's death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis ""under control,"" calling the protesters ""thugs"" and tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform's rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the ""total lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: ""What's the plan here?"" ""With regard to?"" Frey responded. Then he added: ""There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable."" He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were ""clearing the streets and restoring order,"" and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were ""a clear violation of their First Amendment rights."" Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Minutes after the precinct burned, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd's death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: ""Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?"" In a follow-up tweet, he said he ""didn't see anything unreasonable."" The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk"" and said he was ""not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd's death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.",0.0
1620672317,2020-05-30 01:16:04,Minneapolis race riots spread to other US cities,https://www.laprensalatina.com/minneapolis-race-riots-spread-to-other-us-cities/,en,False,,287422,laprensalatina.com,http://laprensalatina.com/,"Washington DC/New York City, May 29 (efe-epa).- Thousands gathered in cities across the United States Friday to protest the death of George Floyd in police custody, after days of vandalism and looting in Minneapolis, where the curfew has now been imposed. In downtown Atlanta, near the headquarters of the CNN television network, groups of protesters smashed store windows, to which the riot police responded with tear gas, according to television broadcasts. Some of the protesters threw rocks at the CNN building and several police vehicles parked outside the premises were also targeted with projectiles, with at least two of them set on fire. Curfew has been imposed until Sunday in the twin cities of Minneapolis and St Paul – separated by the Mississippi river – by their respective mayors in an attempt to control the protests and violence that the region has witnessed during the last three days. The curfew was imposed on Friday after another night of disturbances, with incidents of looting and a police station being set on fire in Minneapolis. The cause of the protests is the death of 46-year-old African-American George Floyd at the hands of police on Monday after being detained on suspicion of trying to use a fake $20 bill at a supermarket. In videos recorded by passers-by, one of four officers who participated in the arrest and who were later fired, is seen kneeling on the back of Floyd’s neck, ignoring his pleas that he couldn’t breathe. “Please, please, please I can’t breathe,” Floyd can be heard saying before he died. Friday’s protests in Minneapolis come amid calls for calm from civilian leaders in the African-American community, confident that the chaos will subside after Derek Chauvin, the police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck, was charged on Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Hennepin County (Minnesota) District Attorney Mike Freeman filed the charges shortly after the announcement of Chauvin’s arrest and said that there may be more charges to come. The city’s mayor, Jacob Frey, has also called for calm, a message similar to that released by Minnesota governor, Democrat Tim Walz, who activated the National Guard on Thursday, fearing another night of chaos. Meanwhile, in the capital of Washington DC, a protest that started out peacefully escalated into clashes with the police and Secret Service officers after the arrests of at least two protesters, with some of the participants throwing plastic bottles in retaliation, as per media reports. Journalists present inside the presidential building tweeted that it was put under a partial lockdown by the Secret Service due to the protests, although the measure was ultimately lifted. In videos of the White House demonstration published on social media, a young man can be seem climbing on the railing of the Freedman Bank building, situated opposite the president’s residence and housing the Office of Foreign Assets and other government offices, to paint graffiti against President Donald Trump amid applause from the crowd. The demonstrators also tore down barricades in front of the White House on more than one occasion, resulting in moments of tension. The protest began with a meeting during which the protesters, many of them wearing masks to protect themselves from the coronavirus, chanted “I can’t breathe” and held placards denouncing the death of Floyd. In New York, hundreds took to the streets Friday for the second consecutive day in which there were also moments of high tension between protesters and law enforcement officials, and which ended with dozens of arrests during incidents in Brooklyn and Manhattan. The first protest was held in Manhattan’s Foley Square, although the most violent actions were recorded in Brooklyn, with three epicenters – in Prospect Heights at the Barclays Center, in Clinton Hill, and in Fort Greene Park where protesters set fire to an empty police van. Tension was experienced at the Barclays Center during altercations with the police, the use of a substance thought to be pepper spray, and arrests.

At one point during the rally, which saw demonstrators march from Founders Park to Johnson City Hall, Gbaa led the crowd in an “umoja” chant — a reference to the popular Johnson City festival that derives its name form the Swahili word for unity. “I just feel like this has been enough,” Gbaa said. “We need to come together as a country, we need to come together as a community to support each other as brothers and sister no matter what color, race, height, size, country — no matter where we’re from, we need to come together as one. “United we stand and divided we will fall,” Gbaa continued, “and I really am proud of Johnson City for coming out here and supporting all black people no matter what race they are, and I’m so proud right now that I cannot — it’s overwhelming.” Kerri Music, a white woman with two biracial children, also spoke to the crowd, telling them she came for her children. “I’m raising my kids in a world where they’re not looked at as biracial, they’re looked at as black and I’m scared for them,” Music said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen, but we need to have more justice.” Music said she even named her son Justice, “because black men don’t get enough justice in this world.” “I’m scared for 20 years from now when my cute little boy is a threat and he’s no longer cute anymore,” Music said. “Where are we going to be in 20 years if something doesn’t change? Am I going to get that phone call in the middle of the night 20 years from now that something happened to my baby boy? That he got pulled over or that someone called the cops on him? “People call the cops for ridiculous reasons, and unfortunately when you call the cops on a black man you may have just given him a death sentence,” Music continued. Just hours before the rally began in Johnson City, Hennepin County (Minnesota) Attorney Mike Freeman announced that former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin had been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death. Chauvin is the officer seen on video pressing his knee into the back of Floyd’s neck until he lost consciousness and ultimately died. The preliminary results from Floyd’s autopsy were also revealed Thursday in the criminal complaint against Chauvin, saying Floyd’s death was likely caused by “the combined effects of Floyd being restrained by police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system.” The family has said it will seek an independent autopsy. A community prayer gathering is set for Saturday evening at the steps of Johnson City Hall, where Johnson City Police Chief Karl Turner and Mayor Jenny Brock are expected to attend.

(Nicole Hester/Mlive.com/Ann Arbor News via AP) Nearly two-thirds of the 60 people arrested Friday night during protests in downtown Detroit over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis were from the city’s predominantly white suburbs. Thirty-seven of those taken into custody were from places like Warren, Farmington Hills, West Bloomfield and even Grand Blanc, which is about 60 miles (96 kilometers) northwest of Detroit, Detroit Police Chief James Craig said Saturday. Detroit was one of a number of U.S. cities where protests were staged, but didn’t see the levels of violence, damage or altercations with law enforcement that occurred elsewhere. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz blamed destruction Friday night in Minneapolis — including setting a police station on fire — on out-of-state instigators. In Detroit, the message given Saturday by Craig, Mayor Mike Duggan and local activists to outsiders was clear: Stay home. “To those who threaten the safety of our community, our police officers, who damage property, we will not tolerate your criminal actions,” Craig told reporters. “Our response will be both measured and effective.” Although Detroit is about 80% black, many of those arrested were white. “We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,” Craig added. “If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community.” One person died in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest over Monday’s death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. The shooting occurred about 11:30 p.m. Friday near Detroit’s Greektown entertainment district as officers were confronted with dozens of protesters. A police report released Saturday said the shooting victim, a 21-year-old man, was sitting in the driver’s seat of a silver Dodge Caliber in a parking lot with two other male occupants when an unknown person fired shots into the vehicle and fled on foot. Police earlier said that based on preliminary information, the shooting suspect had pulled up in a Dodge Durango and fired shots into a crowd. Authorities were still investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting. Levels of violence also were high in other cities. Protesters in Washington threw pieces of bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and U.S. Park Police officers behind barricades around the White House. Some officers were kicked and punched. Protesters in Richmond, Virginia, smashed windows Friday at police headquarters. Police in Houston said about 200 people were arrested and four officers were injured. As protesters blocked traffic in Chicago, some threw bottles and other objects at police vehicles and shattered the windows of downtown businesses. In Detroit, the demonstration began earlier in the day Friday and was peaceful as protesters marched by police headquarters. As evening wore on, some in the crowd became belligerent. Objects were thrown at police. A police captain was hospitalized after being struck in the head with a rock. Another officer injured a shoulder during a fall. Seven police vehicles were damaged. Officers, many in riot gear, confronted the demonstrators and formed lines across streets during the demonstration. But by midnight, the crowd had thinned considerably as police shot canisters of gas toward the protesters. If people from outside Detroit want to protest, they should do it in their own communities, said Ray Winans, one of several activists who participated in Saturday’s news conference. “If black lives matter, advocate with those officers in your community and those suburbs and let them know (that) sometimes you don’t have to pull over black folks just because they’re driving through (your) communities,” Winans said. But, if African Americans behaved the same way in some suburban cities, the result could be far different, he added. “If any of our black and brown boys from Detroit would have went to any of those suburbs and threw bricks and rocks … they probably would have got murdered,” Winans said.",0.0

Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Fires burned unchecked and thousands protesting the police killing of George Floyd ignored a curfew as unrest overwhelmed authorities for another night in Minneapolis, and the governor acknowledged Saturday that he didn’t have enough manpower to contain the chaos. The new round of tumult — which has also spread to other cities — came despite Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz vowing Friday to show a more forceful response than city leaders had the day before. But by early Saturday morning, Walz said he didn’t have enough troops, even with some 500 National Guardsmen. “We do not have the numbers,” Walz said. “We cannot arrest people when we are trying to hold ground.” Walz said he was moving quickly to mobilize more than 1,000 more Guard members, for a total of 1,700, and was considering the potential offer of federal military police. But he warned that even that might not be enough, saying he expected another difficult night Saturday. The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to the city on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The rare step came as the violence spread to other cities: A man shot dead in Detroit, police cars battered in Atlanta and skirmishes with police in New York City. Criminal charges filed Friday morning against the white officer who held his knee for nearly nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed at the time, did nothing to stem the anger. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Minneapolis police said shots had been fired at law enforcement officers during the protests but no one was injured. As the night dragged on, fires erupted across the city’s south side, including at a Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank and an Office Depot. Many burned for hours, with firefighters again delayed in reaching them because areas weren’t secure. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence, one day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. On Thursday, protesters had torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and went on to burn or vandalize dozens of businesses. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association urged Gov. Walz to accept any help. “You need more resources,” the group said in a tweet. “Law enforcement needs leadership.” Not all the protests were violent. Downtown, thousands of demonstrators encircled a barricaded police station after the 8 p.m. Friday curfew. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” Some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. Anger filled the streets of Minneapolis. Ben Hubert, a 26-year-old local resident, said he wasn’t surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. “I’m outraged,” he said of the Floyd case. “But I’m also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It’s been swelling for years.” Chauvin was also accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he pleaded that he could not breathe, while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case four days after Floyd’s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. Trump said Friday that he’d spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow.” He called video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City. He was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd’s death. ___ Associated Press writers Amy Forliti, Steve Karnowski, and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, Bernard Condon in New York, and James LaPorta in Delray Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.",0.0

Biden said Friday, May 29, that the “open wound” of systemic racism was behind the police killing of a handcuffed black man in Minnesota, and swiped at President Donald Trump for inciting violence, without mentioning him by name. “We are a country with an open wound. None of us can turn away,” Biden in a brief online address. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden lamented the “open wound” of the nation’s systemic racism on Friday as he responded to the police killing of a black man in Minnesota. He drew an implicit contrast with President Donald Trump, who has suggested authorities could respond with violence to the protests that followed George Floyd’s death. “The original sin of this country still stains our nation today,” Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in remarks broadcast from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. “It’s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.” Biden announced his bid for the presidency last year arguing he’s uniquely positioned to unite a deeply divided country. He pointed to Trump’s response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as unworthy of America’s people and values. As the country endures another spasm of racial unrest, the central premise of Biden’s campaign is being tested. Biden is responding by positioning himself as an empathetic counter to Trump, who often struggles to convey emotion or connect on a personal level during moments of crisis. Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family and demanded justice for his death while calling for “real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet.” The president later said that he, too, had spoken with Floyd’s family and called them “terrific people.” Trump initially condemned police actions in Floyd’s death but later agitated the unrest by tweeting that protesters could be met with violent police resistance. He threatened to take action to bring Minneapolis “under control,” called violent protesters outraged by the killing “thugs” and revived a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump wrote in a tweet that was flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence.” The White House said the president “did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it.” By Friday afternoon, Trump sought to acknowledge the shocking circumstances of Floyd’s death while commending law enforcement. “He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn’t breathe,” the president said of Floyd. “It was a very, very sad thing for me to see it. We also know that most policemen, you see the great job they do.” Biden, without mentioning Trump by name, made clear he would approach the presidency differently. “This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence,” Biden said. “This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism.” Later appearing on PBS, Biden pointed more openly at Trump: “I think this president has stoked racism.” Rep. Val Demings, a Florida Democrat considered a potential Biden running mate, criticized Trump’s response. “America is on fire,” she said in an interview Friday. “And this president is standing there with gasoline. He is dangerous. He’s destructive, he’s dangerous and he can’t even rise to this occasion.” Amid the outrage, Biden tried to make the rest of the country feel what it was like to be African American in modern U.S. society. “Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering who will be next,” he said, adding, “the anger and the frustration and the exhaustion — it’s undeniable.” Biden must go beyond establishing himself as a calming alternative to the president and demonstrate that he will take action that spurs the unity he’s promised. It’s a feat he may have to accomplish in a hurry if he wants to inspire African Americans to turn out for him in November. The task is especially critical after Biden suggested last week that African American voters who were still undecided between him and Trump “ain’t black,” a comment that some black leaders said were interpreted as taking their votes for granted. Biden quickly said he regretted the comment. NAACP President Derrick Johnson said he believes the nation is in chaos because of a lack of leadership in the White House. But he said change will only come by putting people in positions of power who will be willing to boldly address the needs of affected communities. “I think the real question is, what are people going to do about it and how are those who are in positions of authority, and those who are seeking positions of authority, how are they going to lay out a plan moving forward?” Johnson said. “It’s about what is the collective will of this society to address the systemic deficits that we all know so well but lack the political will to address.” Moments of acute racial tension have afforded platforms for leadership from presidential candidates in the past. Robert F. Kennedy was seeking the White House in April 1968 and arriving in Indianapolis when he learned that Martin Luther King Jr. had been shot and killed. Kennedy stood on a flatbed truck and spoke about the country having to move past the terrible moments of racial strife — comments later credited with preventing unrest. Kennedy was assassinated two months later. Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza said Biden needs to use this moment to connect further with black people and create a more robust black agenda that specifically tackles the need for policing reform and more. “Black people cannot wait for an agenda that speaks to how it is that our lives will change under a new administration,” Garza said. “We currently have a president who is inciting violence against black communities and yet, on the other hand, we have somebody who wants to lead this country that needs to go further in their plans, proposals and their vision for how to make sure that we deal with the state of emergency that black communities are facing.” “It is not enough to engage in politics as usual,” Garza added, “and expect results, as usual.” ___ Stafford reported from Detroit.

Protesters chanted, “Quit your jobs.” The officers backed their line away from the group of protesters who were throwing objects at them. Police ordered demonstrators to leave the street and threatened to arrest them if they did not leave quickly. Protesters used accelerant to burn an American flag. People were watching the scene from rooftops, some laughing at skirmishes that broke out and vandalism by the protesters. Protesters were also walking on the interstate in downtown Atlanta and appeared to be trying to block traffic. The Georgia State Patrol has responded. Earlier, as the protest appeared more calm, Kaity Brackett, 27, said she came out to the protest because she thinks the entire criminal justice system needs to be overhauled, starting with policing. She said the Ahmaud Arbery killing was a catalyst for her and referred to his death as a lynching. Arbery was killed on Feb. 23 by a former district attorney investigator and his son, who were not arrested until after video emerged months later. Brackett wore a blue mask and sat with her partner and a friend. She was less concerned about the threat from the coronavirus. “We risk our lives going to the grocery store, going to get gas,” she said. “This is more important than all of that.” LATEST STORIES:",0.0

(AP) — A large group of protesters chanted loudly as they marched down streets Friday night in downtown Memphis, Tennessee, voicing their frustration and solidarity days after the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into his neck as he pleaded for air. For the second night in a row, a racially diverse flock of protesters gathered in front of the FedExForum, the basketball and concert venue near Beale Street in downtown Memphis. They walked toward the National Civil Rights Museum, the site where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed 52 years ago at what was then the Lorraine Motel.

(Patrick Lantrip/Daily Memphian via AP) Police blocked some streets but their presence was minimal, and the protest remained peaceful. Local TV stations showed the protest live on the internet. Floyd’s death, and the killings in past months of a black man in Georgia and a black woman in Kentucky, have led to violent protests in Minneapolis, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio, and peaceful demonstrations in other cities. Four Minneapolis police officers were fired and investigations are underway after a white police officer was seen on video kneeling against the neck of Floyd. One of the officers has been arrested and charged with murder. Earlier Friday, Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland called for an investigation into whether an officer broke any rules after a video surfaced of a woman being knocked to the ground during a Wednesday protest related to Floyd’s death. Strickland said on social media that he’s asked Police Director Michael Rallings to investigate “an event that occurred Wednesday night with one of our officers and a female protester.” A video has been shared on television and social media that appears to show an officer shoving a woman to the ground. It’s not clear whether she was injured. More than 70 people gathered outside the police precinct in Midtown Memphis and then walked down Union Avenue on Wednesday night to protest Floyd’s death. Police set up barricades and blocked the avenue. Officers later donned helmets, protective shields and other riot gear as the situation became increasingly strained and raucous late into the night. Tensions were escalated by the presence of a man who was holding a sign referencing a Confederate group.

(Patrick Lantrip/Daily Memphian via AP) Wednesday’s protest ended with five arrests and no visible property damage. But activists have questioned actions by police, including a lack of coronavirus-related social distancing, using barricades to limit the mobility of protesters, and wearing riot gear. Kimberly Dollar, who shot the video, said she did not realize she had captured the woman being knocked down until she got home from the protest and reviewed her Snapchat videos. “I didn’t see anything that was crazy from my standing, so I’m not exactly sure why they brought out the riot gear,” said Dollar, a 32-year-old restaurant server. “Apparently there was a target they were going for, and that girl was in the way, I guess.” In Memphis, Strickland has said he shares the protesters’ frustrations with the situation in Minnesota, but he criticized protesters who were not wearing masks and weren’t observing social distancing rules set forth in a city order because of the coronavirus pandemic. “By not doing so, protesters and our officers were unnecessarily put at risk,” Strickland said in a statement Thursday. The mayor’s statement also said he was proud of the way Memphis police officers conducted themselves. The Shelby County Democratic Party responded, saying it was officers who put lives in danger by placing protesters behind barricades and failing to stay 6 feet (2 meters) away from protesters and each other. Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer, a community activist, has alleged police were responsible for escalating the protest. Sawyer, who challenged Strickland in the last mayoral election, had demanded an investigation into the incident in which the woman was knocked down. “I would love for the public to see a timeline on what that investigation looks like, and when the public will have a response on action,” Sawyer said in a phone interview Friday. “I would like the mayor to retract his statement that he was proud of the response of MPD.” A Memphis Police officer looks out into the crowd during a protest over the death of George Floyd, Thursday, May 28, 2020, in Memphis, Tenn.

1620839816,2020-05-30 06:24:17,Crowds protest Floyd killing and Trump outside White House,https://www.wate.com/news/politics/crowds-protest-floyd-killing-and-trump-outside-white-house/,en,True,,84580,wate.com,http://www.wate.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Hundreds of people gathered outside the White House late Friday to protest the police killing of a black man in Minneapolis — and President Donald Trump’s response. Protesters hurled pieces of bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and U.S. Park Police officers who were in riot gear behind barricades around the White House. Protesters at times kicked and punched officers and wrestled over the barricades. PHOTO GALLERY: Protests over George Floyd’s death break out across nation The crowd of hundreds chanted “No justice, no peace” and “Say his name: George Floyd.” A white police officer in Minneapolis killed Floyd on Monday by pressing a knee into his neck while taking him into custody, leading to a national uproar. Protests exploded in dozens of cities around the nation Friday night. As some in the crowd grew more aggressive, police deployed pepper spray to keep them back and maintain a perimeter of officers around the White House. Fellow demonstrators came to the aid of protesters who were sprayed, their eyes red and puffy, offering bottles of milk and water to splash on their faces. By the end of the night, the protesters had stolen about 15 barricades and left police to form a line of officers holding riot shields to keep back the swelling crowd. At one point, the protesters were able to gain control of an officer’s shield and set it ablaze before trying to toss it back at the line of officers. Police used a smoke device to quickly stop them. The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering “unlawful” and ordered everyone to leave Lafayette Square, a seven-acre public park located directly north of the White House. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters. “Out of the park or you will be sprayed,” an officer shouted at the crowd. As the officers continued to push forward through the park, some protesters broke the bricks from the pavement and hurled chunks at the officers. Police did not immediately provide any information about arrests. On Thursday, as violence broke out in Minneapolis, Trump tweeted, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. “Frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. The protesters in Washington Friday night chanted curses at Trump, who was in the White House. Earlier Friday, protesters marched toward the White House after beginning a demonstration several blocks away. At one point, a man was carried off by police into the nearby U.S. Treasury Department Annex building. The crowd swarmed around the officers, shouting, “Let him go.” District resident Abe Neri said of Floyd, “I just feel like he’s just one of many names that we’ve had to create hashtags and T-shirts and campaigns for and I feel like nothing has changed. … And so that’s why I’m out here. Yeah, when you say nothing you’re taking the side of the oppressor.” __ AP video journalist Nathan Ellgren contributed to this report. LATEST STORIES:",0.0
1620870698,2020-05-30 23:43:23,Biden ally sees Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate,https://www.oakridger.com/ZZ/news/20200529/biden-ally-sees-klobuchar-as-less-likely-biden-running-mate?rssfeed=true,en,True,,152402,oakridger.com,http://oakridger.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters on Friday that while he believes Klobuchar is 'absolutely' qualified to be vice president, 'This is very tough timing for her.' Klobuchar was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. During that period, more than two dozen people "" mostly minorities "" died during encounters with police. Following customary practice at the time, she sent the cases to grand juries, which brought no criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Clyburn, who called his view a 'gut feeling,' played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the Democratic Party's all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress' highest-ranking black lawmaker. 'So often in politics, timing really dictates things. Barack Obama I don't think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. 'And I don't know whether he could get elected today.' Clyburn helped revive Biden's badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive win in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party's presumptive nominee. On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd have 'nothing to do with my running mate.' Pressed on whether Floyd's killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. 'And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Klobuchar did not respond to a request Friday by The Associated Press for an interview. On CNN, she sidestepped a question about her vice presidential prospects. 'He's going to make the best decision on whoever he wants to govern with,' she said of Biden. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, spent eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breathe as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. Chauvin's 2006 case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar was elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney's office. Mike Freeman, Klobuchar's successor as prosecutor, made 'all prosecutorial decisions"" about Chauvin, according to a Freeman statement that Klobuchar's office provided Saturday. Klobuchar told MSNBC that she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate 'patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing' by the Minneapolis police. ___ AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

Activists said it's another example of systematic racism in law enforcement, the latest in a series of high-profile black deaths that have exacerbated and inflamed racial tensions nationwide. Former officer Derek Chauvin faces third-degree murder and manslaughter charges after a bystander's video circulated of him holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes before Floyd died. 'What's it going to take to get people to listen?'George Floyd protests in Minneapolis continue into fourth night despite curfew A 19-year-old man was shot and killed late Friday night during protests in Detroit, and Atlanta's mayor delivered an impassioned plea for violence to stop. One protester died in St. Louis, and one federal contract security officer was shot in Oakland, California. Demonstrators in many cities gathered to protest local deaths at the hands of law enforcement: In Indianapolis, protesters held a sign that read ""Justice for Dreasjon Reed."" Reed died after a police pursuit that was broadcast on Facebook Live. In Milwaukee, they invoked the name of Joel Acevedo, who died after an altercation with a police officer in April. In Louisville, Kentucky, on Thursday night, gunfire erupted as hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed in her apartment by police in March. As protests continue into their fourth night in Minneapolis, here's a look at what happened overnight around the USA: St. Louis: Protesters block interstate, one dies Protesters blocked a downtown interstate for about three hours Friday evening. One truck driver rerouted off the interstate was stopped by protesters, and several people started looting his trailer, two displaying guns to the driver, according to police. As the driver attempted to drive away, one person was caught between the two trailers and run over. There were no arrests, police said. Milwaukee: Protesters march in 'solidarity,' stop Interstate 43 traffic More than a dozen businesses were damaged, and about 50 people were arrested overnight Friday, Police Chief Alfonso Morales said Saturday in a news release. The daylong protests Friday had been peaceful as hundreds marched around the city. But around 11:30 p.m., violent unrest broke out around the District 5 Police Station, near Locust Street and King Drive. ""Instead of protesting in the honor of Mr. George Floyd and Mr. Joel Acevedo, many individuals, used this as an opportunity to damage property, destroy businesses, commit robbery, fire shots and steal property for their personal gain,"" Morales said in the release. An officer was shot and injured in the line of duty. ""Thank God, the officer’s injury was non-life-threatening,"" the chief said. – Ashley Luthern, Ricardo Torres and Talis Shelbourne, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Greenville, SC: Hundreds gather for peaceful rally About 200 people, and more by the minute, gathered Saturday morning for a peaceful protest in response to Floyd's death. Dalores Bowens, one of the organizers, said the goal of the protest was to highlight the risks that black people, and others, face at times from police. The big aim, she said, is to encourage unity and have a peaceful expression of anger and frustration. – Mike Ellis, Eric Connor and Sarah Sheridan, Greenville News Pensacola, Fla.: 'Tymar is our George' About 300 to 400 people filled the southern banks of the small hills that flank Graffiti Bridge to express outrage over police violence against African Americans. Advertised as a vigil, the atmosphere felt more like a protest, and its organizers explained its purpose as twofold: a show of communal objection to police brutality and a lamentation for Tymar Crawford. Crawford, 28, was shot and killed by Police Department Detective Daniel Siemen on July 5, 2019. Siemen was fired from the PPD for violating the department's use of deadly force policy, but a grand jury determined there was not enough evidence to warrant criminal charges. ""Tymar is our Pensacola George,"" activist Haley Morrissette said. ""This really shows the energy that is really behind getting justice in the county and here, right now. A lot of people are here to remind us that Tymar is Pensacola's George."" – Colin Warren-Hicks, Pensacola News Journal Oakland, Calif.: 'Damage and destruction,' 1 dead in shooting Interim Police Chief Susan Manheimer said peaceful demonstration turned ""disruptive."" ""We saw damage and destruction here,"" Manheimer said in a video message posted to Twitter. Two contract security officers for the Federal Protective Service of the Department of Homeland Security were shot, one fatally, when someone began firing from a vehicle outside the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building Friday night, FBI San Francisco said in a statement. The FBI could not say whether the shooting was related to protests because the investigation was ongoing, according to public affairs officer Katherine Zackel. The FBI deployed investigators to the scene and was working with the Police Department, Zackel said. Portland, Ore.: Multiple arrests, state of emergency, curfew A police spokesperson said 13 people were arrested overnight. Police called the protests ""riots."" Mayor Ted Wheeler declared a state of emergency early Saturday and said a curfew was ""immediately in effect"" until 6 a.m. local time, then would resume 8 p.m. Saturday. Wheeler released a series of tweets Friday night saying, ""ENOUGH"" and ""Portland, this is NOT us."" ""Burning buildings with people inside, stealing from small and large businesses, threatening and harassing reporters. All in the middle of a pandemic where people have already lost everything. This isn’t calling for meaningful change in our communities, this is disgusting,"" Wheeler said on Twitter. Houston: Nearly 200 arrested Nearly 200 people were arrested Friday into Saturday morning, and most will be charged with obstructing a roadway, police said on Twitter. Four officers had minor injuries, and eight police vehicles were damaged, police said. Earlier in the day, Police Chief Art Acevedo attended a downtown demonstration organized by Black Lives Matter and spoke to the crowd. ""It’s about bad policing. It’s about criminal behavior. And it’s about holding bad cops accountable,"" Acevedo told the group as many booed. Later, dozens of protesters shut down U.S. Highway 59. Lincoln, Neb.: Protesters arrested, shelter-in-place order Protests condemning police brutality began early in the morning at the Capitol. Around 4 a.m. Saturday, police said the protest was no longer peaceful. ""Arrests have been made and will continue to be made for those who continue to break the law. Neighbors in the area please shelter in place,"" the department said on Twitter. Austin, Texas: Dozens protest at police headquarters About a hundred protesters denouncing police brutality and Floyd's death gathered in front of the Police Department’s headquarters downtown around midnight Saturday. A line of officers wearing helmets and batons formed in front of the building and blocked the Interstate 35 service road near East Seventh Street. Officers clashed with demonstrators and pushed them back to the street. Police detained at least one protester, though it was not immediately known why. Protesters chanted, “I can’t breathe” and threw water bottles at the officers. Officers responded by firing bean bag shots. One officer had cuts on his face and one of his elbows; he said he wasn’t sure at what point during the protest he was injured. – Andy Sevilla, Austin American-Statesman Elmira, NY: 'We've had enough' A crowd of about 50 stood outside the Police Department on Friday, chanting – at times in the rain – ""No justice, no peace,"" and ""Black lives matter"" to peacefully demonstrate. Participants stayed for hours Friday, the second consecutive day of demonstrating. Organizer Domari Greene, 30, said plans are to gather again Saturday. ""The message we’re sending out is that not only is the African American community tired of the unjust killings and racism, but people across the nation are also tired of this,"" Greene said Friday. ""We’ve had enough, and no more will officers get away for their crimes, no more just a suspension."" ""We had some interaction with the group, and it was very positive,"" Police Capt. Anthony Alvernaz said, adding he wished motorists would slow down as their speed endangered the group. – Ashley Biviano, Elmira Star-Gazette Chicago: Protesters march downtown; more than 100 arrested Dozens of protesters wearing face masks – many with the communist group Revolution Club Chicago and the organization Refuse Fascism Now, which calls for President Donald Trump’s removal – gathered downtown and marched through the streets for hours Friday evening. The group chanted, ""Say his name, George Floyd"" and ""Black lives matter."" Some held signs that said ""Justice 4 George"" and ""I can’t breathe."" The group blocked a major highway, stopping traffic as police created a barricade with their bicycles. Later, the group stopped outside the Metropolitan Correctional Center and chanted, ""We love you,"" according to videos posted to social media. The peaceful protest took a turn early Saturday morning, when demonstrators broke the windows of several downtown storefronts. About 108 people were arrested, Superintendent David Brown said in a news conference Saturday. ""We had to take swift action so that the violence and property damage wouldn’t escalate,"" he said. The protesters inflected ""minimal damage"" downtown, and about a dozen squad cars were damaged throughout the city, Brown said. Some officers were injured, and one had a broken wrist. Illinois State Police assisted Chicago police ""with several crowds of protesters"" from Friday evening to 4 a.m. Saturday, according to the agency. State police did not make any arrests, the agency said. More than 10,000 people expressed interest in a Facebook event page for a protest Saturday afternoon in Chicago, organized by Black Lives Matter. – Grace Hauck, USA TODAY Columbus, Ohio: 5 arrested, 2 police officers injured Five people were arrested and two police officers were injured by protesters throwing rocks and bricks at them on the second straight night of protests in Ohio's capital city. Police reported broken windows and spray-paint graffiti in the Short North.

People began to gather as early as 12:30 p.m. for a march to the Capitol, where protesters stood on the steps and chanted for change. They took both sides of nearby North Broadway Street before heading to Civic Center Park to hear from speakers. About an hour after the crowd had mostly dispersed, they regathered near the Capitol, prompting law enforcement to push them back from the street to keep traffic moving through the area. Tensions escalated into the night, and some protesters ran through the city, smashing storefront windows. – Bethany Baker, The Coloradoan (Fort Collins, Colorado) Des Moines, Iowa: Protest grows violent, bricks thrown at police cars A protest outside police headquarters spread through downtown and turned violent. Just before 8 p.m., protesters threw bricks at police cars, prompting officers in riot gear to push against protesters. At least one officer sprayed chemical irritants on the crowd, including a Des Moines Register photographer. – Andrea May Sahouri, Des Moines Register Detroit: 19-year-old man killed; police arrest 9 people, fire tear gas amid protests A 19-year-old man was killed late Friday night after shots were fired into a crowd of protesters by an unknown suspect in a gray Dodge Durango.

Officers were attacked during the demonstrations, Craig said. A command officer was struck with a rock and taken to a hospital. An officer on a bike was struck. The Police Department is angry about Floyd's death, too, Craig said: “I will not stand by and let a small minority, criminals, come in here, attack our officers and make our community unsafe."" – Darcie Moran, Angie Jackson, Joe Guillen and Branden Hunter, Detroit Free Press Indianapolis: Police use rubber bullets, tear gas Protesters clashed with police downtown in an hourslong demonstration that started peacefully but turned chaotic after the sun went down. Officers with the Metropolitan Police Department used volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse crowds that lingered on city streets well past midnight. As police stood in riot gear, groups of protesters moved through clouds of gas, chanting, “I can’t breathe!” and “Black lives matter.” George Floyd protests:How did we get here? A patrol car was vandalized. Fires were set in trash cans. A CVS was torched and looted, as were a a jewelry business and a cellphone store. Graffiti on a broken window at Key Bank at Market Tower read, “I can’t use my bank account if I’m dead.” – Crystal Hill, Vic Ryckaert, Kelly Wilkinson, Jenna Watson and Ryan Martin, Indianapolis Star Knoxville, Tenn.: Protesters rally, chant outside police headquarters Hundreds of protesters gathered peacefully in front of police headquarters in a rally hosted by Black Lives Matter Knoxville. Davis Hayes, who ran for City Council last year, led the crowd in a chant: “We have nothing to lose for our chains.” Alison Rose, who works with the National Alliance on Mental Illness, was the first white speaker at the protest, and she spoke directly to other white people. “White people, get it together. Do the work. Educate yourselves,” she said. “Get yourself so deep in history that you will find out the truth: Black history is this country’s history.” – Travis Dorman, Knoxville News Sentinel Los Angeles: Police declare unlawful assembly amid growing tensions The Police Department declared an unlawful assembly after 9:30 p.m. for much of the downtown area, from Interstate 10 to U.S. 101, and the 110 Freeway to Alameda Street, after a night of tense standoffs with protesters. “This is being made following repeated acts of violence and property damage. Residents should stay inside. Business should close. Those on the street are to leave the area,” the LAPD said via Twitter. Hours earlier, protesters blocked the 110 Freeway, temporarily stopping traffic. Louisville, Ky.: Demonstrators gather again after violence Thursday After violent protests erupted Thursday, protesters continued to gather Friday night, demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, an African American woman killed in her apartment by police officers in March. People trashed buildings, broke glass, set fires and looted restaurants in an eight-hour protest that stretched into early Saturday morning, and angry city officials blamed out-of-towners for the trail of vandalism across much of downtown. ""This is not a protest. It is violence,"" Mayor Greg Fischer said at 1 a.m. in a video call with reporters. ""This violence and destruction is absolutely unacceptable,"" he said. ""It besmirches any claim to honor Breonna Taylor's memory. ... No one stands up for justice and equality by smashing windows and burning property. This destruction will not be tolerated."" – Tessa Duvall, Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd, Louisville Courier Journal Memphis, Tenn.: About 300 protesters gather for third straight day For the third straight day, protesters took to the streets to speak out against police brutality and the deaths of three African Americans at the hands of police.

Jason Lemon of Newsweek tweeted a photo of a police vehicle set on fire in the borough. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted that lawmakers were among the protesters who were caught up in the clash: ""A Black New York State Senator (@zellnor4ny) and a Black NYS Assemblywoman (@YourFavoriteASW) were both pepper sprayed in Brooklyn today. They were present as elected leaders to keep the peace and serve their communities. Completely, utterly unacceptable."" In Manhattan, hundreds of protesters descended on Foley Square, chanting, ""I can't breathe"" and “No justice, no peace!” Phoenix: Hundreds march against violence after peaceful vigil A vigil ""to mourn the police violence"" wrapped up shortly after 9 p.m., and organizers discouraged attendees from engaging in any violent protesting and urged them to go home.

An organizer said violence would bring more pain to the family of Dion Johnson, who was fatally shot by an officer. Police said Johnson, 28, was shot after a struggle with a trooper May 25. Activist groups demanded release of the body-worn camera footage depicting the shooting. – BrieAnna J. Frank, Andrew Oxford and Helena Wegner, Arizona Republic San Jose, Calif.: Protesters block five-lane Silicon Valley freeway Protesters marched through the capital of the Silicon Valley, stalling traffic for about an hour on a five-lane freeway and prompting police intervention.

The largely peaceful demonstration stood in contrast to the violence that has broken out in some cities since a white police officer was videoed driving his knee into Floyd's neck as the 46-year-old black man lay on the ground, handcuffed and unarmed. Floyd died Monday after pleading for several minutes and gasping, ""I can't breathe."" Floyd's killing sparked days of unrest that boiled over in several cities Thursday night. In Minneapolis, protesters set fire to a police precinct as officers retreated from the area. In Denver, law enforcement deployed tear gas and rubber bullets, and video also showed a car striking a protester.

(Photo: Caitlyn Jordan/News Sentinel) As of Friday night, no such reports had emerged out of Knoxville, where police made themselves scarce. Not one officer could be seen near the crowd that rallied in the parking lot of the police headquarters on Howard Baker Jr. Avenue. When protesters flooded the streets of downtown Knoxville, chanting, waving signs and blocking traffic, police did not try to stop them. Some officers, most alone or in pairs, stood watch along major roads, dressed not in riot gear but in uniform or plain black clothing. ""That was definitely part of our strategy, to let the protest happen and happen safely and keep as low of a profile as possible,"" Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon told Knox News on Saturday. ""There were no arrests, no reports of violence and, to the best of my knowledge, no property damage other than a couple of parking signs that were spray-painted,"" said Knoxville Police Department spokesman Scott Erland. The demonstrators, who were organized in part by Black Lives Matter Knoxville, called for body cameras for city police officers, said additional criminal charges should be filed in connection to Floyd's death and condemned police brutality against people of color. But mostly they expressed their emotions, and they chanted. ""I can't breathe,"" they said over and over. ""Say his name: George Floyd."" CLOSE Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the Knoxville Police Department's headquarters Friday evening and then marched through downtown after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Knoxville News Sentinel Officials condemn Minneapolis officers Six hours before the rally began, Kincannon and Knoxville Police Chief Eve Thomas issued a joint statement with their first public comments about Floyd's death. Both condemned the action and inaction of the four Minneapolis police officers who were fired in connection to the case. ""We are outraged by the brutal actions of the officers involved in the death of George Floyd,"" the statement read, in part. ""We condemn this egregious behavior and will work tirelessly to make sure nothing like this ever happens in our community.” Shortly after the local officials released their statement, news broke that Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis officer shown with his knee on Floyd's neck, had been arrested on charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter.

Kincannon was present at first, and Vice Mayor Gwen McKenzie stayed throughout. ""The enemy will come to destroy that which is right, but God, we don't worry about him,"" said Matthew Best, director of the Future of Hope Institute at Johnson University. ""We come to speak your truth and speak your love and speak your word. Help us in this city, God, in Knoxville, Tennessee, of all places, the least likely place that folks would think something good would come out of, a Deep South city with a history of injustice. Help us be the way."" Then organizers Constance Every and David Hayes took turns speaking into a microphone. They led the crowd in chants, railed against local officials and introduced other speakers. They demanded body cameras for city police, which officials previously said they hoped to implement by July 1. They also argued that the city's independent police review board does not have the resources it needs to hold officers accountable.

""Get yourself so deep in history that you will find out the truth: Black history is this country's history."" Cars filled the parking lot and spilled out onto the street.

Nervous laughter escaped some when activist Denzel Grant urged each attendee to give their neighbor a hug. At one point, shouting broke out beyond the crowd, and attendees moved toward a man standing alone near the front door of the building and waving an upside-down American flag. Just as it seemed violence could break out, Vice Mayor Gwen McKenzie wedged herself between the man and the demonstrators to defuse the situation.

The largely peaceful demonstration stood in contrast to the violence that has broken out in some cities since a white police officer was videoed driving his knee into Floyd's neck as the 46-year-old black man lay on the ground, handcuffed and unarmed. Floyd died Monday after pleading for several minutes and gasping, ""I can't breathe."" Floyd's killing sparked days of unrest that boiled over in several cities Thursday night. In Minneapolis, protesters set fire to a police precinct as officers retreated from the area. In Denver, law enforcement deployed tear gas and rubber bullets, and video also showed a car striking a protester. In Louisville, Kentucky, unidentified gunfire wounded seven people during a protest over the March police killing of Breonna Taylor.

(Photo: Caitlyn Jordan/News Sentinel) As of Friday night, no such reports had emerged out of Knoxville, where police made themselves scarce. Not one officer could be seen near the crowd that rallied in the parking lot of the police headquarters on Howard Baker Jr. Avenue. When protesters flooded the streets of downtown Knoxville, chanting, waving signs and blocking traffic, police did not try to stop them. Some officers, most alone or in pairs, stood watch along major roads, dressed not in riot gear but in uniform or plain black clothing. ""That was definitely part of our strategy, to let the protest happen and happen safely and keep as low of a profile as possible,"" Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon told Knox News on Saturday. ""There were no arrests, no reports of violence and, to the best of my knowledge, no property damage other than a couple of parking signs that were spray-painted,"" said Knoxville Police Department spokesman Scott Erland. The demonstrators, who were organized in part by Black Lives Matter Knoxville, called for body cameras for city police officers, said additional criminal charges should be filed in connection to Floyd's death and condemned police brutality against people of color. But mostly they expressed their emotions, and they chanted. ""I can't breathe,"" they said over and over. ""Say his name: George Floyd."" CLOSE Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the Knoxville Police Department's headquarters Friday evening and then marched through downtown after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Knoxville News Sentinel Officials condemn Minneapolis officers Six hours before the rally began, Kincannon and Knoxville Police Chief Eve Thomas issued a joint statement with their first public comments about Floyd's death. Both condemned the action and inaction of the four Minneapolis police officers who were fired in connection to the case. ""We are outraged by the brutal actions of the officers involved in the death of George Floyd,"" the statement read, in part. ""We condemn this egregious behavior and will work tirelessly to make sure nothing like this ever happens in our community.” Shortly after the local officials released their statement, news broke that Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis officer shown with his knee on Floyd's neck, had been arrested on charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter.

Kincannon was present at first, and Vice Mayor Gwen McKenzie stayed throughout. ""The enemy will come to destroy that which is right, but God, we don't worry about him,"" said Matthew Best, director of the Future of Hope Institute at Johnson University. ""We come to speak your truth and speak your love and speak your word. Help us in this city, God, in Knoxville, Tennessee, of all places, the least likely place that folks would think something good would come out of, a Deep South city with a history of injustice. Help us be the way."" Then organizers Constance Every and David Hayes took turns speaking into a microphone. They led the crowd in chants, railed against local officials and introduced other speakers. They demanded body cameras for city police, which officials previously said they hoped to implement by July 1. They also argued that the city's independent police review board does not have the resources it needs to hold officers accountable.

Andy Beshear announced he'd send the National Guard to Louisville, calling it a step to ""ensure the safety of everybody"" and ""help keep peace."" “What we have seen, especially last night, and what our intelligence says is going to happen tonight are outside groups moving in, trying to create violence to harm everybody who is on those streets,"" said Beshear. ""We cannot let Breonna’s legacy be marred by violence and we can’t let our streets turn violent."" Meanwhile, Mayor Greg Fischer said he is implementing a dusk-to-dawn curfew for future protests against the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor. ""The tone clearly changed last night. The number of people on our street clearly changed last night, as well,"" Fischer said. ""This turned from being a peaceful protest into violence and terrorism and looting on the streets of our city."" Fischer said the National Guard would arrive in Louisville ""later today."" Fischer said if people want to protest, they can do so ""while it's light outside."" A spokeswoman said the curfew will run from 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. For the second night in a row, people took to the streets en masse to protest the fatal shooting of Taylor, an unarmed African American who died in her apartment after being shot at least eight times by Louisville Metro Police in March. ""This violence and destruction is absolutely unacceptable,"" he said in a 1 a.m. video call. ""It besmirches any claim to honor Breonna Taylor's memory. ... No one stands up for justice and equality by smashing windows and burning property. This destruction will not be tolerated."" Taylor, an ER tech, was at her southwest Louisville apartment when police entered her home on a ""no-knock"" search warrant related to a narcotics investigation. Officers returned fire after Taylor's boyfriend fired a shot at what he said he believed to be intruders. No drugs were recovered from the apartment. Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations There were no altercations between protesters and police Friday, and, unlike the night before, there were no reports of gunfire in the crowd. City officials reported two arrests, and a television news crew was taken to the hospital. But vandals did significant damage across downtown: Windows to office buildings, at least one hotel and restaurants were smashed. Looters sidestepped broken windows and rummaged through the bar area of Eddie Merlot's Prime Aged Beef & Seafood, hauling away armfuls of alcohol. A similar smash-and-grab unfolded on live TV at the Omni Louisville Hotel on South Second Street, with looters sprinting away with bottles of booze. Throughout the night, Courier Journal reporters and photographers saw canisters of tear gas being fired; heard flash bangs exploding; and spotted numerous fires in trash cans and recycling bins. Shards of glass were everywhere, and anti-police graffiti was spray-painted on buildings and sidewalks. Editorial:Louisville must listen to protesters in Breonna Taylor case and battle injustice ""This has been a very sad night for our city,"" Fischer said. ""Many came tonight to express the pain, anger and frustration brought about by the tragic death of Breonna Taylor. Many were here to exercise their First Amendment right to peacefully protest — and I respect that right. ""Unfortunately,"" the mayor continued, ""another faction of people use the occasion of a protest as an excuse to cause destruction."" Before midnight, a peaceful demonstration paraded on Bardstown Road. Jessie Halladay, a spokeswoman for Louisville Metro Police, also pointed to out-of-towners as the reason for much of the chaos and damage. ""They're determined to create division within this community,"" she said. ""They are well-equipped. They bring sticks, bottles, bats, shields, guns. They are ready to set fires. They come well-stocked with water, supplies, other things. They are ready to start problems."" Friday night's unrest followed a smaller, but still raucous, protest Thursday that left seven people with gunshot wounds, including one in critical condition. Those shots were not fired by police, LMPD said. Taylor's death is one of a number of high-profile killings of black Americans, several at the hands of police officers, that have sparked protests across the country. Protesters in recent days have taken to the streets for George Floyd, a black man killed by Minneapolis police in an incident captured on video. Floyd's death came at a time when many Americas were already outraged over the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, who was jogging in a south Georgia neighborhood when he was killed by white men. In Louisville, protesters carried signs and chanted about both Taylor and Floyd. Around 11 p.m., a small group of protesters walked down Bardstown Road, followed by a line of police vehicles. Dozens of cars honked their horns in support. 'She's gone':Breonna Taylor's death sparks outrage as she's remembered as 'good girl' People on sidewalks handed out water, reminding the crowd to stay hydrated, while chants of “hands up, don’t shoot” filled the air. At Eastern Parkway, the protesters paused and knelt in the intersection, taking a brief moment of silence before walking back up Bardstown toward downtown. Chanting throughout the night included “Breonna Taylor,” “No justice, no peace” and “F*** the police.” As the group moved past a line of police officers blocking the entrance to the Mid-City Mall, several leaders also urged the group to “keep moving” and repeated that “this is a peaceful protest.” Helicopters buzzed above the unrest for hours, their spotlights illuminating both tense confrontations and periods of standstill. By midnight, empty milk jugs and crushed plastic water bottles littered the street in front of Metro Hall, where a handful of protesters remained — silently refusing to budge for the line of more than 50 officers in riot gear that had sought to advance. Earlier in the evening, tensions rose as protesters spotted law enforcement officers inside the Hall of Justice. Protesters ripped the American and Kentucky flags from their poles in front of the building, using lighters and alcohol to set them ablaze. Some hurled water bottles and other hard objects at the courthouse windows, splintering the glass. Other panes were smeared with red paint hand prints, made to look like blood. As Thursday's protests turned violent, Taylor's family took to social media to plead with the community for peace. ""We are not going to stop until we get justice,"" Juniyah Palmer, Taylor's younger sister, said in a video. ""But we should stop tonight before people get hurt.""

Friday night’s protest is taking place at the FedEx Forum. One of the organizers for this protest says he wants how Memphis protests to be a model for the country. Pastor Devante Hill tells us in a city with deep civil rights history, these peaceful demonstrations in Memphis are a chance to show the greatness in the city. “We’re at a point where we can grow forward, and I believe if we could grow forward we can be one of the leading cities in the country,” Hill said. “That’s prospering with wealth, that’s prospering with opportunity, that’s prospering with second chances.” But Hill believes part of this happening depends on specific relationships. “Between law enforcement and community. That’s going to be the starting place,” Hill said. “If Memphis wants to see better community, a safer community then law enforcement has got to change the way the community respects them in different ways.” He thinks what’s happening now is a time for law enforcement to speak up. “I believe that those young ones, those millennial police officers that have not been embedded into a system or a way of thinking, I believe they can be a catalyst for change,” Hill said. “I call on them to denounce all forms of hatred, all forms of hatred and bigotry and I believe there are some who are on the other side who have these different beliefs and I believe it’s important for the community to hear that.” Memphis Police Director Mike Rallings released a statement in regards to George Floyd’s death this afternoon, saying in part, “there is no explanation for what we witnessed in Minneapolis. The level of force and the disregard for life is sickening.”",0.0

The woman who was hit, who has been identified as “Molly,” gave WREG a new angle of the video, showing what she was seeing until her camera hit the ground. Molly was reportedly taking pictures during the protest. Protester Hunter Demster says he saw it all. “I see this mob of police officers in full riot gear come around the corner and just start bashing people,” Demster said. “Everybody is just talking about the one clip of Molly that was taken off of her feet, blindsided by a Memphis Police officer. That type of contact is illegal in football.” He says Molly was documenting what was happening and initially stepped out of the way of the officers, but then was hit by one of the them. “He shoved her so far that there was an oncoming car she could have easily been pushed in front of,” Demster said. Initially, the police department and Memphis’ mayor never mentioned the incident when discussing how things went during the protest. The mayor even praised how police handled things. “That is that blind allegiance that we are fighting against,” Demster said. “Then it takes video evidence of this brutality to raise some kind of awareness.” After WREG continued to press for police and city to respond, Strickland sent a statement, saying, “After learning more information on an event that occurred Wednesday night with one of our officers and a female protester, I have asked director Rallings to fully investigate the matter.” Police declined our request for an interview, but said they are aware of the video and an investigation has been opened. They are working to identify the officer involved. “I don’t trust that entire process. That’s police policing police,” Demster said. Demster and others want an apology from the mayor for initially praising police actions, and they also want an independent investigation. “We want transparency. Something has to change. The system in broken obviously for this to keep happening over and over and over and over again,” Demster said. Demster says Molly plans to file a lawsuit.",0.0

More than 200 people marched through downtown Memphis, moving from the FedEx Forum to City Hall as well as the National Civil Rights Museum. When the crowd arrived at intersections, protesters stopped and knelt for approximately nine minutes, which is around the same amount of time that Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin pinned Floyd to the ground. The diverse crowd is filled with people who say this is important, and it’s time for change. That includes organizer and local activist Frank Gotti, who is concerned the Minneapolis officer will not face jail time. “He might did get charged, but what are his results gonna be? Everybody can get happy right now and get excited because they charged him,” Gotti said. “Because he’s an officer, they’re not gonna do nothing but give him a slap on the wrist.” “There are fighters out here!” said protester Tre Black. “There are people that are fighting not only for our rights but your rights, and peoples at home rights. I think the people feel energized and want to get organized.” Bottles of water and face masks were available for those who attended. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with third degree murder and manslaughter. He was fired from the Minneapolis Police Department earlier in the week.

1621023399,2020-05-30 00:00:00,National Guard summoned to aid cities amid police clashes,http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/Military/2020/05/30/National-Guard-summoned-to-aid-cities-amid-police-clashes.html,en,False,,94065,johnsoncitypress.com,http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/#spider,"As anger over Floyd’s killing spread to cities nationwide, local leaders increasingly said they could need help from National Guardsmen or even military police to contain the unrest. Georgia’s governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler also declared an emergency and ordered a nighttime curfew for the city. Another 500 Guard soldiers were mobilized in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died and an officer faced charges Friday in his death. But after another night of watching fires burn and businesses ransacked, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said early Saturday that he was moving to activate more than 1,000 more and was considering federal help. The Guard was also on standby in the District of Columbia, where a crowd grew outside the White House and chanted curses at President Donald Trump. Some protesters tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue, and threw bottles and other objects at officers wearing riot gear, who responded with pepper spray. “I just feel like he’s just one of many names that we’ve had to create hashtags and T-shirts and campaigns for and I feel like nothing has changed,” district resident Abe Neri said of Floyd. “And so that’s why I’m out here. Yeah, when you say nothing you’re taking the side of the oppressor.” Many protesters echoed that frustration, that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. The anger that seized the nation comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by a white father and son while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. In scenes both peaceful and violent across the nation, thousands of protesters chanted “No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” They hoisted signs reading: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp tweeted that up to 500 members of the Guard would deploy immediately “to protect people & property in Atlanta.” He said he acted at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who earlier appealed in vain for calm. Some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters in downtown Atlanta. At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said, as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at Del Frisco’s restaurant in the Buckhead neighborhood several miles north because of protesters there. “This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr.,” Bottoms said. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Bottoms was flanked by King’s daughter, Bernice King, and rappers T.I. and Killer Mike. “We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” said Killer Mike, crying as he spoke. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. In Portland, Oregon, protesters broke into police headquarters and authorities said they lit a fire inside. In Virginia’s capital, a police cruiser was set on fire outside Richmond police headquarters, and a city transit spokeswoman said a bus set ablaze was “a total loss,” news outlets reported. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, scrawled graffiti across its charred body and set it aflame again as officers retreated. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. The police department said numerous officers were injured. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Protesters in Houston, where Floyd grew up, included 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas: “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” Demonstrators on the West Coast blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland, California. About 1,000 protesters in Oakland smashed windows, sprayed buildings with “Kill Cops” graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police, who said several officers were injured by projectiles. One Los Angeles officer received medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and at least one city bus was vandalized. Police declared an unlawful assembly throughout downtown, where aerial footage from KTLA-TV showed scored of people corralled by police. San Jose, California, police said that Santa Clara County sheriff’s deputies shot at a fleeing SUV that was shown on video striking protesters, the San Jose Mercury News reported. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was hospitalized with a non-life-threatening injury, officials said. Liccardo said his city’s officers shared the community’s outrage over Floyd’s death. “It was a horrible injustice,” he told the AP. Portland, Oregon, police said at least one shooting was tied to the protest, although details weren’t immediately released. Two people were arrested during overnight riots in which protesters set fires throughout downtown and smashed storefront windows, police said, but arrest details were immediately available. Police, who declared the protest a riot, said they deployed gas after people threw projectiles at them. Mayor Wheeler tweeted a plea to protesters to remain peaceful and said that, while he had left the city to attend to his dying mother, he was heading back. He later declared a state of emergency. “Portland, this is not us,” he wrote. “How does this honor the legacy of George Floyd?”",0.0
1621023397,2020-05-30 00:00:00,Trump walks back his incendiary Minneapolis 'thugs' post,http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/Government/2020/05/30/Trump-walks-back-his-incendiary-Minneapolis-thugs-post.html,en,False,,94065,johnsoncitypress.com,http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/#spider,"Trump’s repeated condemnation of the killing and outreach to the man’s family was a marked change in tone from his earlier comments that also invoked a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump had written in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence.” Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. “Frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump’s explanation did little to satisfy hundreds of protesters who gathered outside the White House into early Saturday, shouting “No justice, no peace” as well as an obscene chant directed at the president. Trump’s whiplash comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, following three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. And they underscored Trump’s complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order mantle while looking to appeal to black voters during an election year. They also highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department’s efforts to “combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.” In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful “because I’ve let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “We don’t mind being accused of police brutality,” he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. Trump, after hours of backlash, said Friday evening that he was unaware of the origins of the phrase. “But I’ve heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd’s family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man’s killing, which he called “a terrible insult to police and to policemen.” “I just expressed my sorrow,” Trump told reporters. “He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn’t breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it.” Still, Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful. “The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,” he said. “Law and order will prevail.” Criticism of the Trump’s tweet had been swift, with his presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden saying it was “no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.” “It’s not helpful,” said Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. “Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.” Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed a chance to help the public cope with “two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.” Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump — who rarely holds his tongue — has been silent in the face of a long list of high-profile killings by police of black men, including Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold and whose dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) He spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players for kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And in one speech he appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after Biden suggested last week that black voters who support Trump “ain’t black.” A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference — and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president’s charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign’s plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Twitter’s decision to flag Trump’s tweet — the second time it has acted this week — came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant’s protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, accusing the White House of promoting violence. Supporters of the president balked at the move. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of “purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.”",0.0

It is famous in that region with upwards of 300,000 people attending from all over the U.S. One evening I loaded the family in our station wagon and went to the fair. Fortunately, in the crowded parking lot I found a space near the main gate. Entering, our 3 year old, Cindy, suddenly disappeared amongst the crowd. I was in a real panic, and then I spotted her running towards a group of people waving Maddox banners. In the middle was State Governor, Lester Maddox, holding an axe handle aloft and resting his other hand on a barrel filled with them – for sale. For some reason the Maddox crowd parted, and Cindy ran straight to the governor. Spotting this cute little girl, he scooped her up and asked if he could count on her vote when she grew up. I do not know what she said, however, she reached for the axe handle, and Lester let her hold it. She showed appreciation by whacking someone. The crowd cheered in delight at her antics. Cindy was having a grand time in the arms of arguably the utmost racist governor to hold that office since the Civil War. The axe handles were to symbolize that any black person with the nerve to enter the Pickrick, Maddox’s fried chicken establishment in Atlanta, met Lester barring the way with an axe handle in hand. Fortunately, nothing noteworthy occurred in Georgia while he was in office. Maddox was considered something of a “loose cannon,” and kept citizens on edge; afraid he might say or do most anything. Being the state’s top dog, wielding tremendous powers, you don’t want an irresponsible person in that position during a national crisis. Some governors are in that boat today, not as a racist, but ill prepared in handling this crisis. I personally think President Trump opened Pandora’s Box when he told governors, “You’re going to be calling your own shots.” Tennessee’s (R) Governor, Bill Lee, has not ruffled too many feathers with his handling of the pandemic – at least never making any national derogatory news. I think governors are all trying their best, but not without controversy. News on TV showed a woman sentenced to jail for opening her hair salon a week early; police tackling a woman for refusing to wear a protective mask in public in New York, and near riots occurring in Michigan, Wisconsin, California, and other states. People are finding out that states are not as united as assumed and state governors wield a lot more power than previously thought. People felt a jolt when they could not go to the beach, get a haircut whenever they pleased, or keep their business open – thanks to executive orders, or rules imposed by a state governor Some feel these imposed rules and restrictions as an erosion of civil rights. Erosion of civil rights is something not to take lightly. Thankfully, a majority sees it as elected leaders doing what they think is best for their constituents, or riots would occur nationwide. Best, or not, going through a food line to keep from starving, people are demanding all businesses reopen so they can get back to work; pay their bills, and get back to normalcy. Handling the pandemic has a myriad of problems and is a balancing act to prevent a full-blown pandemic or a full-blown depression. Opening businesses too soon could cause more deaths from the coronavirus; keeping businesses closed too long will cause a depression. With public unrest running high over money for food, shelter and other bills has persuaded governors and the federal government to open things up again in stages – they, in turn, are hoping creation of a vaccine or medicine happens that cures the virus – or that it just dwindles away. With states gradually relaxing guidelines and other restrictions, the overall public mood has improved. While not euphoric, it is at least cautiously optimistic. Following social distancing, and other CDC guidelines, virus containment is possible and just maybe it will not reemerge with a vengeance.",0.0

(ABC) — A police officer was seen on camera firing what appeared to be pepper balls at a news crew during a live television broadcast of the second night of Louisville protests, prompting an apology from the Louisville Metro Police Department. A crew from WAVE-TV was downtown in the Kentucky city Friday night, covering demonstrations over the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed by police in her own home in March. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m., as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported. As WAVE-TV was on air, reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera: “I’ve been shot! I’ve been shot!” Video shows a police officer aiming directly at the camera crew, as Rust describes the projectiles as “pepper bullets.” “I want to apologize,” Louisville police spokeswoman Jessie Halladay told the Courier Journal. “It’s not something that should have occurred if she was singled out as a reporter.” Halladay said she couldn’t tell who the officer was at this time, but that police would review the video again and “if we need to do any investigation for discipline, we will do that.” The video shows Rust and the camera crew moving away as indignant in-studio anchors ask if they’re OK and what’s going on. Rust tells them they’re OK, and that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away. “Well I’m sure if they would have just said, ‘Move,’ you would have done so,” an anchor is heard telling Rust. A clip of the WAVE-TV broadcast posted to Twitter amassed more than 8 million views in less than six hours, and was retweeted more than 50,000 times, including by other journalists and rapper Ice-T. Louisville’s protests followed the release of a 911 call Taylor’s boyfriend made March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in her home. Taylor’s death has captured national headlines alongside the killings of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia in February and George Floyd, the black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes as he pleaded for air. Protesters carried signs calling for justice for Taylor and Floyd, whose death has touched off protests across the country this week, including in Minneapolis itself. The use of non-lethal force on the WAVE-TV crew happened the same day CNN employees were arrested live on air while covering protests in Minnesota. Two people were arrested at Friday night’s protest in Louisville, and no significant injuries were reported, Halladay said. That’s in contrast to Thursday night’s protests, where seven people were shot. Louisville police have said officers didn’t fire their service weapons. Mayor Greg Fischer criticized the destruction of property seen Friday night. “This violence and destruction is absolutely unacceptable. It besmirches any claim to honor Breonna Taylor’s memory,” Fischer said in a statement. “Just this morning, Breonna’s family called for peaceful and safe protest.” Fischer said most of the grievances associated with Taylor’s death have been addressed in a live-streamed press conference after 1 a.m. Fischer had announced Friday that the use of no-knock warrants by police were being suspended, the latest in a series of policy changes and other actions in response to Taylor’s death. Fischer and Halladay said police believed a “significant percentage” of protesters came from outside Louisville. “I don’t know anyone from our great city that wants to destroy it,” he said.",0.0

""It was not enough,"" Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — ""an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,"" according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. ""We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,"" the governor said Saturday. ""But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life."" The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd's death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order ""to help keep peace in Louisville."" ""I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,"" Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. ""But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe."" President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd's memory is for authorities to ""get tougher"" on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called ""radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can't do this."" ""They've got to be tough, they've got to be smart,"" Trump said of state officials. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military."" In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump's comments, saying that though the outrage is ""real and legitimate,"" the protests are ""being hijacked by violent radical elements."" ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,"" Barr said. ""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.""

Leaders of the statewide non-profit issued the following statement attributed to co-founders and co-executive directors Charlane Oliver and Tequila Johnson: “Our organization, in cooperation with other activists, held a peaceful rally today to protest the murder of Minneapolis resident George Floyd by police as well as to deliver a clear message to Metro and state government leaders that Tennesseans deeply oppose racism and police brutality. The event drew some 4,000 attendees and our staff registered over 300 new voters. It was a peaceful assembly. “It is our firm belief that those individuals defacing and destroying public property after the rally were not a part of the original event. The actions by this small group reflect neither the beliefs of the groups that led today’s peaceful assembly nor those of the majority of the attendees. This behavior dishonors the memory of George Floyd and other black Americans that have died unjustly at the hands of police. “The Equity Alliance condemns and disavows tonight’s violent rioting. We urge anyone feeling heartfelt, honest anger over the murder of George Floyd to direct that energy toward November’s election. The only true way to change our nation for the better is by taking up our civic duty as Americans and making it clear with our vote that we reject racism in all its forms.” 10:38 p.m. A window was broken at the historic Ryman Auditorium in downtown Nashville tonight.

Carmack, an early 1900s politician and newspaper editor, was known for authoring editorials attacking fellow Tennessee journalist Ida B. Wells' writings in support of the civil rights movement, including encouraging retaliation against her, resulting in the burning of her Memphis newspaper office. Carmack was fatally shot near the Capitol in 1908 as part of an ongoing dispute over favorable prohibitionist coverage in the Tennessean. David Roberson, spokesman for the Tennessee Department of General Services, says nothing will be done about the statue tonight. It’s unclear whether state troopers will remain posted it by it all night, as they are now. Roberson said a meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow morning to discuss the statue’s fate, though it’s also unclear who will attend.

They didn’t interact with the demonstrators. Original story: Nashville Mayor John Cooper said he would attend a Saturday afternoon rally protesting police brutality and racism following the death of George Floyd. Cooper encouraged members of the city council to join him at the 3 p.m. rally at Legislative Plaza, which follows a wave of protests in other cities. The mayor said it was ""an especially critical time for all of us, as Metro’s leaders, to show up and listen to black voices speaking out from across Davidson County."" Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer kept a knee pressed into his neck for more than eight minutes. The officer, Derek Michael Chauvin, 44, was arrested and charged with murder. Floyd's death intensified anger and frustration for many who say it is an example of pervasive racism among law enforcement nationwide. Protests have swept through many major cities. Friday night protests in Memphis and Knoxville were peaceful, but violence has erupted during protests in Minneapolis, Louisville and Atlanta. Organizers of the Nashville rally said they wanted to create a peaceful and safe space for people to express their grief and call for change. Organizer Hamid Abdullah said Floyd's death had become a tipping point within the movement against racism and police brutality. ""More people are coming together. More people are listening. More people are paying attention,"" Abdullah said. ""People are fed up with brutality and they want to do something."" Abdullah said he welcomed ""all people of good will"" to the rally. He said he hoped Cooper would understand the need to make changes to prevent similar deaths in the future.

The ongoing debate over policing and racial bias has been a prominent part of life in Nashville for years. In 2018, local activists spurred a citywide vote that created the Community Oversight Board, a civilian panel that investigates allegations of police misconduct. The vote came after a white police officer shot Daniel Hambrick, 25, a black man, while he was running away during a foot pursuit. That officer, Andrew Delke, 26, was arrested and charged with murder. The case is pending. Reach Adam Tamburin at 615-726-5986 and atamburin@tennessean.com. Follow him on Twitter @tamburintweets.

Joyce Beatty, Columbus City Council President Hardin pepper-sprayed during protest",https://www.wate.com/news/rep-joyce-beatty-columbus-city-council-president-hardin-pepper-sprayed-during-protest/,en,False,,84580,wate.com,http://www.wate.com/#spider,"COLUMBUS (WCMH) — Columbus City Council President Shannon Hardin says he, Franklin County Commissioner Kevin Boyce and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty were sprayed with mace or pepper spray during a protest in downtown Columbus Saturday morning. Council President Hardin tweeted a video with Rep. Beatty saying that they are okay, and called on people on both sides of the protest to remain calm. Beatty said in an interview later Saturday that the pepper spray was “prolific.” “I don’t remember hearing anyone saying, ‘Move or we’re going to pepper spray,’” Beatty said. “Councilman Hardin got the brunt of it and he was in the middle of the sidewalk.” She added that she didn’t think the pepper spray was necessary. “I heard no warning,” she said. “Obviously if someone had said and held up a pepper spray and said, ‘I’m gonna pepper spray,’ we would have moved. Nobody wants to be pepper sprayed, trust me.” A spokesperson for Beatty told NBC4 that while the protest was underway, someone started scuffling with police. Police took that person down, which made other protesters angry. Beatty stepped in to try and calm the situation when police started spraying. Hardin and Boyce pulled Beatty out of the fray. “We understand that tensions are high. Our tensions are high as well. We are angry, and we need change. But the only way we will get change is by peaceful demonstrations,” said Hardin. “While it was peaceful, there were times where people got off the curb, into the street, said Beatty. “Too much force is not the answer this.” Beatty said Saturday’s protest was more peaceful than the protests on Friday night, when stores and businesses were damaged, saying she wanted to be there to support the organizers of Saturday’s protest. “I can tell you 95 percent of the folks were amazing,” Beatty said. She said that in the last 20 minutes she was in the area are when things began to take a turn with the arrival of police on bicycles. “Whatever happened last night, which I am totally against – breaking into buildings, marking up city hall – I am totally against that,” Beatty said. “But there was none of that today and I kept saying to the officers, ‘Do not excite them, do not excite them.’” Beatty added that a handful of protesters got off the sidewalks and into the streets, which is what prompted the police response. “Before we knew it, the bikes were going up against a young sister standing next to me,” she said. “A gentleman was knocked to the ground and then you know what happened. People start pushing and shoving. I got caught in the middle of it. Beatty said Hardin was pepper sprayed more than she was, adding Boyce was there and managed to get Beatty out of the way. Just want to let folks know that when @RepBeatty @VoteBoyce and I were down at the protest we did get sprayed with mace or pepper spray. We are all ok, and we want to encourage folks, both police and protestors, to stay calm. pic.twitter.com/RDQ1p4YDRY — Shannon Hardin (@SG_Hardin) May 30, 2020 Beatty said she came out to support those protesting injustice. “The message we want to have is we need to be in this together,” Beatty said. “We need to be fighting against the injustices, fighting against racism and tensions are high when you think about George Floyd, but when you are out there and you come in an antagonistic way, it only excites a riot.” She is asking protesters to stop “tearing up” the city and asking officers to stop antagonizing protesters, adding the officers were too aggressive toward excited protesters who were on the sidewalk who “may have had a toe off the sidewalk.” “I was there because I wanted the young protesters to know that in solidarity that I stand with them,” Beatty said. “You know, I’m a grandmother, I’m an elected official, but I’m a black woman first and I felt the pain. So I was there on the edge of the sidewalk when it all happened, wanting to support and feeling the need to protect this young sister. She was very vocal, but that’s freedom of speech. To push and shove and use a bicycle against her, I just think there could have been a better way.” Thanks to whoever gave me that milk. pic.twitter.com/q82XcPChaY — Shannon Hardin (@SG_Hardin) May 30, 2020 Hardin released the following statement Saturday night: “I’m angry and frustrated. Folks are being shot down while jogging and suffocating under the knee of injustice. Today, I saw with my own eyes that 99 percent of protesters were just trying to make their voices heard, while some individuals in the crowd were attempting to take advantage of the situation. I also saw police going too far, and that’s unacceptable. The people have spoken, and I hear you. The time for commissions and studies is over. The time to institute real police reform is now.  “Columbus needs to establish independent investigations into police use of force, including negotiating a Civilian Review Commission into the next police contract. Columbus needs to change the use of crowd dispersal techniques, as recommended by the Matrix report. And finally, Columbus needs to quickly move forward to implement the Community Safety Advisory Commission’s recommendations and the rest of the Matrix report.” The Matrix report is a review of Columbus law enforcement conducted by a team of consultants, employees of the Division of Police, city staff and the community working together since the winter of 2018-19. Beatty urged the protesters to recognize the difference between standing up to injustices and causing injustice. “If you’re going to be out there causing injustice and destroying property and looting and doing any of those things, that it is more destructive and that’s not the way we gain what we’re all in this for and that’s to bring justice,” she said. “I’ll be the first to stand with them, but we cannot tear up our own communities and our own buildings because that’s not going to accomplish anything.”",0.0

Demonstrators moved peacefully though the Uptown district and close to 1,000 marched along downtown streets toward the New Orleans Police headquarters and Orleans Parish Prison. Several in the crowd carrying signs that read, “No Justice No Peace” and “Say his name!

Earlier Saturday morning as joggers and bicyclists circled Audubon Park’s oak-shaded path, a group of about 100 protesters gathered. They carried signs that read “let them breathe,” “rest in peace George Floyd” and “police brutality is the deadliest virus.” Marching down the sidewalk, clumping together in violation of social distancing guidelines but mainly wearing masks, they chanted in a call and response “Black Lives Matter,” “No crooked police” and “Don’t kneel on me.” A crowd of about 40 people gathered in the historic Treme neighborhood in New Orleans on Friday, May 29, to protest the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, by a Minneapolis police officer.

The park and the surrounding neighborhood, like all of Uptown New Orleans near the river, had once been plantations where black men and women were enslaved. A few cars honked in support of the marchers. A driver gave the protesters a thumbs up. Police cars were parked on the side streets every few blocks. “The world is crazy and there needs to be change,” said Hanna, one of the protesters. She refused to give her last name. Hanna said that she was willing to risk the danger of COVID-19 contagion to protest. “I’m more worried about men like my husband getting killed,” said Hanna, who is white and married to a black man. The marchers returned to the park and marched down the main path. People out exercising talked about the protest after it passed. “All lives matter,” said a white middle-aged white woman to her walking companion. Then, a little louder so a reporter could overhear clearly, she added, “It’s the press that causes the division.” More protests across the South: Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms pleads for peace amid fiery George Floyd protests On the other side of town, a group of roughly 15 gathered at the corner of Esplanade and Claiborne avenues, where a larger group of about 50 had gathered the day before.

A rack had been set up on the neutral ground displaying T-shirts printed with Black Lives Matter slogans and the images of Travon Martin and the jailed activist Mumia Abu-Jamal.

Updates: Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin arrested, charged with murder in George Floyd's death The day ended with a 5 p.m. rally in Duncan Plaza, the park in front of City Hall. A crowd of 1,500, nearly all wearing masks, showed up. As the speakers began, everyone moved to the center of the bowl-like park, packing in tightly like a festival crowd. The organizers began with instructions for attendees should they be arrested. They had everyone repeat in unison a number to call for legal help. The speakers spoke about police brutality, rent strikes and trans rights. One woman took the mic and sung in a tone like a mantra ""Black trans lives are sacred. We matter."" Throughout the rally, the NOPD had no visible presence. Officers and their cars were stationed around the corner and a block away. Then, the mic was handed over to any black person who wanted to speak. ""White people, thank you for being here and showing your empathy, but I'm going to tell you it's not enough,"" said one speaker to the crowd that was three quarters white. ""We are tired of facing every injustice alone."" At the end of the nearly two and half hour rally, a chant of ""black lives matter"" ended the gathering. The organizers encouraged everyone to leave in pairs for safety. Most of the crowd filed away. A few stayed to talk with friends as the sun set in New Orleans.

The flight ushers in a new era in commercial space travel and marks the first time NASA has launched astronauts from U.S. soil in nearly a decade. “Let’s light this candle,” commander Doug Hurley said just before liftoff. Ever since the space shuttle was retired in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian rockets launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts took and from the space station. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Two NASA astronauts climbed into their capsule Saturday for a second attempt at a history-making ride into orbit aboard a rocket ship designed and built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company. Stormy weather had threatened another postponement most of the day, but the skies began to clear and the outlook improved markedly in the afternoon, just ahead of the scheduled 3:22 p.m. liftoff of the 260-foot Falcon 9 in what would be the first launch of astronauts into orbit by a private company. Their destination: the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth. It would also be NASA’s first human spaceflight launched from U.S. soil in nearly a decade. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would lift American spirits. “Maybe there’s an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said. Veteran astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken pulled on their angular, white-and-black spacesuits with help from technicians wearing masks, gloves and black hoods that made them look like ninjas. Before setting out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV — another Musk product — Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. Wednesday’s countdown of the rocket and its bullet-shaped Dragon capsule was halted at just under 17 minutes because of the threat of lightning. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence returned to the Kennedy Space Center for the second launch attempt. Ever since the space shuttle was retired in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. “I would be lying to you if I told you I wasn’t nervous,” Bridenstine said before the launch attempt. “We want to do everything we can to minimize the risk, minimize the uncertainty, so that Bob and Doug will be safe.” Because of the coronavirus, NASA severely limited the number of employees, visitors and journalists allowed deep inside Kennedy Space Center, and the crowd was relatively small, at a few thousand. At the center’s tourist complex, though, all 4,000 tickets were snapped up in a few hours. The space agency urged people to stay safe and watch from home, and by NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. But spectators also began lining the Cape Canaveral area’s beaches and roads. Signs along the main beach drag read, “Godspeed.” Among the spectators was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville. “It’s pretty historically significant in my book and a lot of other people’s books. With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” Wight said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 to taxi astronauts to and from the space station, under contracts totaling $7 billion. Both companies launched their crew capsules last year with test dummies. SpaceX’s Dragon aced all of its objectives, while Boeing’s Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was almost destroyed because of software errors. As a result, the first Starliner flight carrying astronauts isn’t expected until next year.

When the United States erupted in unrest following Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in 1968, his hometown of Atlanta was one of the few major cities to maintain relative peace. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms invoked that history in a passionate and deeply personal plea for protesters to go home. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) ATLANTA (AP) — When the United States erupted in unrest following Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in 1968, his hometown of Atlanta was one of the few major cities to maintain relative peace. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms invoked that history in a passionate and deeply personal plea for protesters to go home. “When Dr. King was assassinated, we didn’t do this to our city,” Bottoms said Friday night. “If you care about this city, then go home.” The protests are quickly becoming a high-stakes leadership test for Bottoms just as her national profile is rising. She is under consideration to be presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s running mate — and even if she isn’t tapped for that role, many Democrats view Bottoms as a rising star within the party. Protests in Atlanta over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white officer in Minneapolis pressed a knee into his neck, turned violent before Bottoms spoke. Police cars were smashed and CNN’s headquarters was vandalized as protests shook a city that prides itself as the birthplace of the civil rights movement. Bottoms addressed the crowds both as a mayor and a mother. “I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old,” Bottoms said. “When I saw the murder of George Floyd, I hurt like a mother.” When she heard of the potential of protests, Bottoms said she called her son to find out where he was. “I said, ’I cannot protect you and black boys shouldn’t be out today,'” she said. Her message to protesters: “You’re not going to out-concern me … about where we are in America. I wear this each and every day.” Bottoms’ remarks were widely praised. TJ Ducklo, the Biden campaign’s national press secretary, said the presumptive nominee “has been grateful for Mayor Bottoms’ support and counsel since the earliest days of our campaign.” “Her passion, her empathy and her strong and steady leadership are shining through during this difficult moment, and the city of Atlanta is lucky to have her leading the way,” Ducklo said. Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, a conservative Republican ally of President Donald Trump, tweeted that the mayor had issued a “strong” statement. The 50-year-old Bottoms was elected mayor in 2017 and previously served on the City Council. During a recent interview with The Associated Press before the protest, she spoke of Atlanta as a “special place where people of color are able to break traditional molds and change the landscape of who we are as a country.” Until now, her national profile among Democrats has been eclipsed by fellow Georgian Stacey Abrams, the voting-rights activist who narrowly lost her bid in 2018 to become America’s first black female governor. But Bottoms has engaged in national issues during her time in City Hall. She was among the big-city mayors to blast Trump’s immigration policies, and she ended the city jail’s contract with federal immigration enforcement. She’s leading the U.S. Conference of Mayors’ efforts on the census and housing policy. Bottoms was one of Biden’s earliest endorsers, providing backing that was helpful at a time when the Democratic field included dozens of candidates who spanned generations, genders and races. She was a precinct captain in overwhelmingly white Iowa, where Biden finished an embarrassing fourth, before going on to the Southern states that reversed his fortunes and helped him become the presumptive nominee. Biden has pledged to pick a woman as his running mate and is under growing pressure following Floyd’s death to make sure that selection is a black woman. Beyond Bottoms, he’s believed to be considering Abrams, California Sen. Kamala Harris and Florida Rep. Val Demings. Several white women are also contenders, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. The prospect of another white vice presidential hopeful, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, may fade given her time as a prosecutor in the county that includes Minneapolis. South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn told reporters on Friday that this is “very tough timing for her.” Clyburn, whose endorsement of Biden was crucial to his commanding victory in the South Carolina primary, has spoken positively of Bottoms. Asked during the AP interview what she’d bring to the ticket with Biden, Bottoms, a former judge and City Council member, noted that she’s served in each branch of government, with her executive tenure overlapping with a massive cyberattack on city government’s technology infrastructure and now the coronavirus pandemic. “You’ve got to have proven leadership that’s been tested in the midst of crisis,” she said. ___ Sloan reported from Washington.

By 8:15 p.m. Saturday, flames could be seen shooting from a first-floor window of the Metro Nashville Courthouse and City Hall. That event led police to issue a 10 p.m. curfew, Mayor John Cooper to declare a state of civil emergency and Gov. Bill Lee to order the National Guard into the city. Multiple people were arrested before the curfew began. “After the arson and vandalism at the courthouse, this has taken on a much different response,” police spokesman Don Aaron said. “Those who continue to harm the city — those who continue to participate in this destruction — are being warned that they’re engaging in unlawful assembly and officers are prepared for arrests.” Police detained people on Broadway after 10 p.m. and urged people on the pedestrian bridge to leave downtown. The afternoon started with a large and peaceful rally at the Legislative Plaza, but problems began to emerge as demonstrators started to march. A little more than a mile from the Capitol, several people were arrested when windows were smashed in a Metro Nashville police cruiser near Sixth Avenue South and Korean Veterans Boulevard; some protesters later threw rocks and bottles at officers. ""It's a mess right now,"" Nashville police central precinct commander Gordon Howey said late Saturday afternoon. About 90 minutes after that first violent confrontation, a handful of protesters had made their way to Nashville's Metro Courthouse and City Hall where some were throwing rocks and smashing windows on the building. Police met those protesters with force but dozens of other demonstrators arrived a short time later; officers under a barrage of rocks and bottles, in the shadow of City Hall, sprayed pepper spray in an attempt to gain control of the situation. Demonstrators smash a Metro Nashville Police car outside Central Precinct in Nashville, Tenn., Saturday, May 30, 2020 after the “I Will Breathe” rally to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being pinned down by a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day. (Photo: Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean) Organizers of the rally released a statement late Saturday night condemning the violence. “Our organization, in cooperation with other activists, held a peaceful rally today to protest the murder of Minneapolis resident George Floyd by police as well as to deliver a clear message to Metro and state government leaders that Tennesseans deeply oppose racism and police brutality. The event drew some 4,000 attendees and our staff registered over 300 new voters. It was a peaceful assembly,"" said Charlane Oliver and Tequila Johnson in a statement attributed to the founders and executive directors of The Equity Alliance “It is our firm belief that those individuals defacing and destroying public property after the rally were not a part of the original event. The actions by this small group reflect neither the beliefs of the groups that led today’s peaceful assembly nor those of the majority of the attendees. This behavior dishonors the memory of George Floyd and other black Americans that have died unjustly at the hands of police."" PROTEST UPDATES: Protesters marching in downtown Nashville; multiple arrests made The rally began at the Legislative Plaza about 3 p.m. Saturday where several thousand people gathered for a demonstration that included lawmakers and community leaders speaking at the event. Nashville Mayor John Cooper was among them and he encouraged members of the city council to join him. The mayor said it was ""an especially critical time for all of us, as Metro’s leaders, to show up and listen to black voices speaking out from across Davidson County.""

It was a little more than a mile to the south of the Legislative Plaza where the first violent clashes occurred. Protesters bashed in the windows of a police cruiser outside the police department's Central Precinct at Sixth Avenue and Korean Veterans Boulevard. By about 6 p.m. Saturday, a series of officers in riot gear with masks, helmets and batons arrived at the precinct. A crowd converged around them and few plastic water bottles flew toward the officers. Officers on horseback soon followed and some in the crowd threw rocks and water bottles toward the officers. The crowd moved down Broadway and through Nashville's popular honky tonk district, with some vandalizing buildings along the way, including Bridgestone Arena. By 7 p.m., a small group of protesters had arrived at City Hall where some were smashing the building's windows with rocks and other items. Tension near City Hall abated for a while, with protesters and officers talking while police held a line. By 8 p.m., a statue outside the state Capital of controversial lawmaker and newspaper publisher Edward Carmack had been torn down.

A short time later, police with riot gear arrived as a fire burned inside a window at city hall. Officers deployed tear gas as rioters clustered in the center of public square park. ""This afternoon’s rally for George Floyd and racial justice was peaceful. I attended and listened,"" Cooper said on Twitter at 8:22 p.m.. ""We cannot let today’s message of reform descend into further violence. If you mean our city harm, go home."" At 8:45 p.m., Cooper declared a civil state of emergency and police issued a 10 p.m. curfew. Shortly after 9 p.m. Lee said he was, at Cooper's request, authorizing the National Guard in response to the protests. ""The threat to both peace and property is unacceptable and we will work with local law enforcement and community leaders to restore safety and order,"" Lee tweeted. ""This is not a reflection of our state or the fundamental American right to peaceful protest."" As the curfew neared, police said anyone outside after 10 p.m. would be arrested. Several downtown storefronts had broken windows.

1621202488,2020-05-30 00:00:00,'Back in the game': SpaceX ship blasts off with 2 astronauts,http://www.timesnews.net/Nation/2020/05/30/Back-in-the-game-SpaceX-ship-blasts-off-with-2-astronauts-1.html,en,True,,94121,timesnews.net,http://www.timesnews.net/#spider,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A rocket ship built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company thundered away from Earth with two Americans on Saturday, ushering in a new era in commercial space travel and putting the United States back in the business of launching astronauts into orbit from home soil for the first time in nearly a decade. NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send Apollo crews to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they slipped safely into orbit. “Let’s light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the historic words used by Alan Shepard on America’s first human spaceflight, in 1961. The two men are scheduled to arrive Sunday at the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth, for a stay of up to four months, after which they will come home with a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea, something the world hasn’t witnessed since the 1970s. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the case of George Floyd, the handcuffed black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others expressed hope the flight would lift American spirits and show the world what the U.S. can do. “We are back in the game. It’s very satisfying,” said Doug Marshburn, of Deltona, Florida, who shouted, “USA! USA!” as he watched the 260-foot rocket climb skyward. SpaceX becomes the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. “This is something that should really get people right in the heart of anyone who has any spirit of exploration,” Musk, the visionary also behind the Tesla electric car company, said after liftoff, pounding his chest with his fist. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. Over the past few years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. NASA plans to rely in part on commercial partners as it pursues it next goals: sending astronauts back to the moon within a few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. At a post-liftoff rally held at NASA’s massive 525-foot-high Vehicle Assembly Building, President Donald Trump commended Musk and proclaimed: “Today we once again proudly launch American astronauts on American rockets, the best in the world, from right here on American soil.” He vowed the U.S. will be the first to land on Mars, promising a “future of American dominance in space.” Vice President Mike Pence, who also witnessed the launch, said that as the nation deals with the coronavirus and racial strife, “I believe with all my heart that millions of Americans today will find the same inspiration and unity of purpose that we found in those days in the 1960s” during Apollo. The first attempt to launch the rocket, on Wednesday, was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather threatened another postponement for most of the day, but the skies began to clear just in the time. The astronauts set out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV after Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket’s first-stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast, to be reused on another flight. “Thanks for the great ride to space,” Hurley told SpaceX ground control. The two crewmates batted around a floating blue dinosaur plush toy doubling as a dragon, demonstrating that they had reached zero gravity. SpaceX controllers at Hawthorne, California, cheered and applauded wildly, and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine declared: “This is everything that America has to offer in its purest form.” Attendance inside Kennedy Space Center was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the crowd amounted to only a few thousand. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators flocked to beaches and roads, some of them not wearing masks or keeping 6 feet from others. Among the spectators was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York. “With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” he said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Because of the coronavirus, the astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And the SpaceX controllers had masks and were seated far apart. In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. Once settled in orbit, Hurley disclosed that the capsule has been christened Endeavour — or maybe the American spelling, Endeavor; he didn’t specify — a storied name in the history of exploration, also given to one of the space shuttles. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. Under the new corporate-public model, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) Saturday’s mission is technically considered a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. The first flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But the project encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. And Boeing’s first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was nearly destroyed during a test flight in December. For SpaceX and the future of public-corporate space exploration, the stakes on Saturday were extraordinarily high. With the spaceship finally on its way, Musk got choked up talking about the weight of his responsibility for the astronauts’ lives and their families and noted that the return to Earth is more dangerous in some ways than ascent, “so we don’t want to declare victory yet.” Still, Musk said he wasn’t nervous about the launch on Saturday the way he was during the previous attempt. “Today, I don’t know, it felt like just the fates were aligned,” he said.

Memphis Commercial Appeal About two hours after a demonstration against police brutality ended peacefully Saturday night, a confrontation between a crowd of people and a team of police officers in riot gear and some on horseback played out on Beale Street. Police had set up a barricade near the Orpheum Theatre to separate officers from the crowd. Some people in the crowd crossed the barricade to the police side. An officer on horseback appeared to try to steady his horse from hitting a protester. Buy Photo The fourth night of demonstrations in Memphis, Tenn., on Saturday, May 30, 2020, saw protesters face off with police in riot gear near the Orpheum on South Main Street. The protests are in reaction to the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after being pinned down by a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day. (Photo: Joe Rondone/The Commercial Appeal) A chaotic few seconds followed: police barricades tumbled to the ground and people fell down. Police moved forward. Glass bottles flew through the air. Later, the crowd chanted ""No justice, no peace."" The standoff was a dramatic contrast from a peaceful protest march earlier in the evening. It ended without arrests and police did not interfere with the march. Most of the crowd from the protest march left around 9 p.m. from the National Civil Rights Museum, a short walk from Beale Street. But after 11 p.m., a group of people began to argue with police officers and sheriff's deputies near Beale Street. The crowd grew to about 60. Some officers arrived with riot shields. It's not clear if the people in the later crowd participated in the earlier march. Nor was it clear how the confrontation began. Two people in the crowd said a person was playing the drums and that officers told him to stop playing, triggering a reaction from the crowd. Other people talked about police breaking up a party. By 11:30 p.m., there were about 35 officers on the scene, including one armed with a long gun.

(Photo: Joe Rondone/The Commercial Appeal) Whatever the origin of the police response, the situation soon turned back to the issue of police brutality. One of the main people arguing with police was Darin Alston, who brought up George Floyd's death. Others tried to deescalate the argument, saying that they didn't want another incident. As police moved back towards to the Orpheum, someone in the crowd jumped onto a police car. Police barricaded themselves at the intersection of Beale and Main by the Orpheum. An officer was seen pushing people in the crowd. Soon more officers with shields, helmets and other riot gear arrived. ""No justice, no peace,"" said Diasha Graham, who was part of the crowd. ""No race is safe. We all are dying. We need to unite and make a change. And make a difference, all as one."" The standoff ebbed and flowed. After police horses arrived and the barriers tumbled, the situation appeared to calm down. In announcements over loudspeakers, police told people to clear the area. Then about 12:45 a.m., officers were beating their riot shields with batons and chanting ""Move!"" They began moving forward in a phalanx from the Orpheum down Beale Street. At least one woman was tackled, someone set off a firework and someone threw a bottle. Seven people were arrested early Sunday morning during the confrontation. The woman who was tackled, Victoria Jones, was charged with disorderly conduct, rioting and resisting detention. She was released on her own recognizance. The other six people faced a variety of charges including disorderly conduct. They remained in police custody on Sunday afternoon. Details on any injuries or arrests weren't immediately available early Sunday morning. Police officers on the scene referred questions to the department's public information officers, who didn't respond immediately to an email inquiry. CLOSE Memphis police and protesters clashed May 30 on Beale Street in Downtown Memphis. Memphis Commercial Appeal Reporters saw officers tackle at least two people, Jones and a man. A woman tried to put herself between the officers and the woman who was arrested, but it's unclear if this second woman was also detained. By 1:15 a.m. the confrontation appeared over and people had cleared the street. Memphis pastor and activist DeVante Hill, who helped with the earlier protest march, commented on Twitter: ""Tonight just when I thought things were over and we could successfully say we had a peaceful protest, there were young men and women who staggered around near Beale and Main. MPD definitely (incited) them with riot gear, horses and AR-15s . . . "" He said two people were arrested, but this could not immediately be confirmed. ""I really believe we can do this. I truly believe we can do this another way. A crowd of 30 staggering people met with intense force like that is just uneasy for not only me to understand but a group of my other white brothers and sisters present as well,"" Hill wrote.

(Photo: Henry Taylor / The Leaf-Chronicle) Just after 2 a.m., Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer said she and a group of people headed to 201 Poplar to support protesters who had been arrested. “We weren’t here to protest,” she said. “We were here for bail support.” She said jail officials told her and the group to leave and come back at 4 a.m. They decided to wait in the parking lot since it was nearly 4 a.m. She said officers then started to count down and told the group they had five minutes to leave the area or “lethal force” would be used to remove them. She said they had a right to be there so they refused to leave. “They arrested people that we know, people that we love,” she said. “They are leaders in our community, peaceful folks.” Around 3:30 a.m., about 50 people were outside 201 Poplar, waiting on the sidewalk and grassy area in front of the Downtown building. There was no noticeable law enforcement presence at that time, although Memphis police officers had been there earlier with riot shields, followed by Shelby County sheriff's deputies. By 4:30 a.m., only about 10 people remained outside 201 Poplar. Earlier Memphis protest ended peacefully despite some tensions Earlier Saturday evening, a crowd had gathered outside the National Civil Rights Museum in Downtown Memphis. More than 300 protesters ended a similar protest in that spot Friday night. On Saturday, the crowd of around 500 walked together, making stops at Clayborn Temple and the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Reflection Park and kneeling for several minutes at the intersection of Beale Street and Second Avenue, and on Poplar Avenue in view of the Hernando DeSoto Bridge.

(Photo: George Walker IV / The Commercial Appeal) At the Civil Rights Museum, protest leaders attempted to start the rally the same way Friday's started — by passing the megaphone from person to person. But there was disagreement about who should speak. Protester Rob Brown, who is black, said black people needed to be at the center of the movement and instructed white attendees to stand back and allow more black attendees to speak first. The response was mixed. While one person handed him a second megaphone so he could speak louder, others yelled their opposition.

The demands included releasing all protesters from jail and dropping all charges against them; activist involvement in creating a new curriculum and budget for Shelby County Schools; and a citizen veto power for the Shelby County budget.

She advocated for a better response from Mayor Jim Strickland. When the crowd approached Front Street and Poplar Avenue, multiple police squad cars were there to meet them.

As that group walked down Front, Phalisha Jackson walked near the back. “It shouldn’t take the outrage of the public to arrest a police officer,” Jackson said of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was charged with third-degree murder in the death of Floyd.

DeVante Hill said the protesters would use their ability to protest with order and decency. He said tearing up businesses will make them look bad. “With this type of momentum, we can do anything,"" Hill said. Just after 9 p.m. hundreds of protesters went back to their cars and walked north on Mulberry Street. David Schuermann, 69, stood on his porch and applauded. A pair of protesters handed him a cardboard sign that had “Black Lives Matter” written in marker. “I think they’re doing a good job being peaceful,” said Schuermann of the protesters. He said he thought it stayed that way because the police presence didn’t antagonize the crowd. “The police have been pretty good. I think they’ve been well behaved, and the protesters have been well behaved,“ Schuermann said. He saw similarities in the death of Floyd and others at hands of police to that of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., 100 yards away, 52 years earlier. “I was a teenager when Martin Luther King Jr. was killed. ... It’s the same damn thing. It keeps happening,” Schuermann said. “We need to solve the problem, which is systemic racism.” Earlier in the day, another group of about two dozen protesters met outside the Mt. Moriah police station, according to a video of the event posted on Facebook. In the video, the protest organizer said the group was there to stop police brutality. A timeline of protests in Memphis The nightly rallies began with a silent demonstration Wednesday intended to protest the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery but turned into separate verbal confrontations with Memphis police and two counter-protesters. Wednesday: 'Stop killing black people': Demonstration closes Union Avenue as protesters face off with counter-protesters, MPD On Thursday evening, no counter-protesters appeared and the police presence was less pronounced. Thursday: Protesters gather against police brutality for a second night in Memphis By Friday morning, Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland called for an investigation of police actions during the protest on Union Avenue. Friday: Mayor Strickland calls for investigation of police actions during Memphis protest The statement was an apparent reference to a video that showed a police officer with a riot shield knocking down a woman. The protest that began Wednesday night extended until after 1 a.m. once MPD brought out barricades between protesters and its officer who were silently standing dressed in riot gear. Thursday: County, state officials criticize Memphis Police Department, administration's response to protest Friday: Memphis protesters take to Downtown streets for third night of demonstrations By Friday evening, a demonstration began at FedExForum, winding through downtown, stopping at City Hall and ending at the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel. Memphis pastor and activist DeVante Hill shared his megaphone, giving anyone who wanted to a chance to address the crowd. Some people shared stories about their own interactions with police. One woman sang to the crowd. One man simply asked the crowd to say out loud that Black Lives Matter. Around 8:15, they walked to Beale Street and B.B. King Boulevard and blocked the intersection for nine minutes, one for each minute Floyd spent repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe before his death. The demonstration ended without incident outside the room where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. The crowd sat on the ground covering most of the paved walkway leading to the museum's doors and listened to each other share. ""This is not a political movement,"" Hill said. ""This is a people movement."" Memphis protests among week of demonstrations nationwide The Memphis protests were part of a series of demonstrations in cities across the county sparked by Floyd's death in Minneapolis. He died Monday after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes after Floyd was restrained. The police department said they responded to a ""forgery in progress,"" found a suspect and ordered the suspect to get out of his vehicle. The four officers involved in the incident have been fired. Minneapolis police identified the officers Wednesday as Derek Chauvin — the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck — Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng. After several nights of protests, Chauvin was arrested Friday.

""It was not enough,"" Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — ""an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,"" according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. ""We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,"" the governor said Saturday. ""But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life."" The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd's death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order ""to help keep peace in Louisville."" ""I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,"" Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. ""But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe."" President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd's memory is for authorities to ""get tougher"" on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called ""radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can't do this."" ""They've got to be tough, they've got to be smart,"" Trump said of state officials. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military."" In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump's comments, saying that though the outrage is ""real and legitimate,"" the protests are ""being hijacked by violent radical elements."" ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,"" Barr said. ""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.""

(WTVF) — Organizers in Nashville are preparing for a rally against police brutality and racism after the death of George Floyd. While there's been looting and unrest in some cities that held protests, people behind the rally want it to be peaceful. ""The voiceless are the ones that destroy the city,"" Hamid Abdullah of The Brother's Round Table told NewsChannel 5. ""We want to make sure people have the voice, express it and let the elected officials know if you will not do justice, then we will replace you."" Abdullah and John Smith are among the organizers of ""I Will Breathe"" Revolution Rally being held in downtown on Saturday from 3 - 5 p.m. The rally will start at First Baptist Church Capitol on Rosa Parks Boulevard and will reach Legislative Plaza where several people will speak. A march will take place afterwards. On Saturday, Nashville Mayor John Cooper said he will join the rally. ""This is an especially critical time for all of us, as Metro’s leaders, to show up and listen to Black voices speaking out from across Davidson County,"" Mayor Cooper said. The rally was sparked by another incident involving a white police officer and a black person in custody. It was an incident caught on camera of a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on the neck of Floyd for several minutes while he was on the ground. His last words were, ""I can't breathe."" ""I will breathe,"" Smith said. ""I will not stand for another black man or human being put in that situation."" Smith said these type of officer-involved incidents aren't new, they're just being caught on camera. His anger could be felt among lawmakers with the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators who held a Zoom meeting on Friday. There was an overwhelming sense of frustration, anger and exhaustion. ""Words are hollow without being followed by positive action steps. We're sick and tired of being sick and tired,"" Rep. Yusuf Hakeem, D-Nashville, said in the meeting. ""We're not animals. Black people are not animals. Do you understand?! We are people too, and I'm tired of this!"" Rep. Vincent Dixie, D-Nashville, expressed. Representative Dixie said this recent incident though feels different. He hopes the widespread outcry will finally bring some change. Legislators in the meeting agree there needs to be a policy change from training on racial profiling to setting aside money to invest in members of the black community. ""When you place value on a life educationally, academically and financially, then you demonstrate a care and concern for that population of people, and demonstrate to the larger population that life is worth something,"" Rep. Harold Love, D-Nashville, added. Harold said the budget needs to have substantial investments in the communities, and suggested pulling money from the funds for the controversial school voucher bill. The Metro Nashville Police Department said it's aware of the rally on Saturday. Chief Steve Anderson released a statement responding to the death of Floyd: Every officer in our police department and throughout the country should be emotionally shaken by what has occurred in Minneapolis. Words cannot adequately express my disdain over the actions that led to the death of George Floyd. The total lack of concern shown by the officer as he continued to hold his knee to the neck of Mr. Floyd as he repeatedly struggled to breathe is unconscionable. Also intolerable is the lack of intervention of the officers who stood there. ",0.0

""Every officer in our police department and throughout the country should be emotionally shaken by what has occurred in Minneapolis,"" Metro Nashville Police Department Chief Steve Anderson wrote in a statement. A bystander video of Floyd's death spread quickly on social media this week, showing the former officer, Derek Chauvin, driving his knee into Floyd's neck as the handcuffed man repeatedly said he could not breathe. Chauvin and three other officers involved in the Monday incident have been fired, and on Friday, Chauvin was arrested. The video that circulated showed Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes before he died. Meanwhile, Floyd's death has sparked protests and riots nationwide. Ben Crump, an attorney representing Floyd's family, has called for the arrest of the remaining former officers. The conduct of law enforcement has sparked criticism in the past in Tennessee. Former MNPD Officer Andrew Delke is awaiting trial on a murder charge. Delke, who is white, shot Daniel Hambrick, who was black, three times in the back during a July 2018 foot chase in North Nashville. Activists have cited the 25-year-old's death as a violent example of racial bias on the police force. Delke, 26, is the first Nashville officer ever to be charged with murder after an on-duty shooting. Last summer, U.S. Marshals shot and killed a wanted man in the Frayser neighborhood of Memphis, triggering a violent protest. The man was identified as 20-year-old Brandon Webber. Experts later raised questions about the response of the Memphis Police Department to the protests. Minneapolis officer's actions called 'unconscionable' ""Words cannot adequately express my disdain over the actions that led to the death of George Floyd,"" Anderson wrote. ""The total lack of concern shown by the officer as he continued to hold his knee to the neck of Mr. Floyd as he repeatedly struggled to breathe is unconscionable. Also intolerable is the lack of intervention of the officers who stood there."" Williamson County Sheriff Dusty Rhoades also added his criticism of the situation and the other officers involved. ""The death of George Floyd is wrong in so many ways,"" he told the Tennessean. ""If you're in the law enforcement community and can't see that, you should get the hell out. I don't know what is worse, the rogue cop who was arrested today or the ones who stood by watching and didn't do anything."" Nolensville Police Department Chief Roddy Parker said the situation does not represent the vast majority of officers who love their communities. ""I've watched as life left many people during my career, and this was no easier to watch,"" Parker posted on the department's social media page. ""I saw this I was literally screaming at the TV, 'What the hell are you doing?' George Floyd should not have died this way. This is not the image I want associated with my chosen profession. No officer wants this. George Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck while arresting him. (Photo: Photo courtesy of Christina Dawson) ""There are people who shouldn't be wearing the badge and many who have tarnished it. Sometimes we just need to speak up when something looks or feels wrong, even when it's one of our own. This is where we earn the public trust –– by being real. Sometimes law enforcement make mistakes. Sometimes it's a lack of training. Sometimes we're just plain wrong."" Knoxville Police Department Chief Eve Thomas issued a statement Friday which condemned the actions of the officers involved in Floyd's death and commended Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo in firing them. ""The conduct exhibited is neither taught nor accepted in our profession, and it severely undermines the strides law enforcement agencies across the country have made to earn the trust of their communities,"" Thomas said. ""Police officers have a foundational duty and responsibility to treat all individuals with dignity, decency and respect, and must be held accountable when they fail in that basic principle of public service. Behavior that does not represent the values of the profession or serve to improve the well-being of the community should never be tolerated."" Cheatham County Sheriff Mike Breedlove called the video disturbing and said the type of restraint used “was very problematic.""

(Photo: Darnella Frazier Via Storyful) “He’s complying,” Breedlove said of what he saw in the video of Floyd. “Bottom line (is), there must be some lack of training up there,” Breedlove said. He emphasized the importance of training law enforcement officers and regularly renewing training. “The only way they’re going to be able to get past it (is with) better training. (We’ll have to) see what pans out with the investigation.” Gallatin Police Chief Don Bandy concurred the use of force was unnecessary and “very inappropriate, in my opinion."" ""It was disheartening to see, especially because there are so many good law enforcement officers out there (who are) really concerned about serving others,"" Bandy said. ""It’s definitely not what we want to see in this profession.” Memphis Police Department Director Michael Rallings joined the chorus of law enforcement who denounced Chauvin's actions. He offered condolences to Floyd's family. ""There is no explanation for what we witnessed in Minneapolis,"" Rallings said in a statement posted to social media. ""The level of force and the disregard of life that was shown sicken me. ""I understand the frustration that many are feeling, and I, too, believe that this incident should be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted by authorities. As a law enforcement officer, we must protect our citizens from harm and crime. If the line is crossed and if an officer becomes a criminal by violating the laws that he or she swore to uphold, that officer must be held accountable.” Clarksville Police Department Chief Al Ansley called what happened to George Floyd ""disgusting"" and said it's something that police and law enforcement supporters everywhere should ""call out"" as unacceptable. ""The tactics used by those officers were not proper tactics, and I don't care whose policy you're looking at, especially our policy,"" he said. Ansley also said that policy includes a prohibition on choke-holds, a responsibility to aid an arrested subject who's in distress and a duty to intervene. He said there are rare situations where it might be appropriate to kneel on a subject, but under no circumstances should an officer kneel on someone's neck. In fact, Ansley said, when a subject is handcuffed, officers have an additional responsibility to ensure that subject's safety. Gov. Lee: Floyd's death 'should be brought to justice' On Thursday, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said the former Minnesota police officers involved in Floyd's death ""should be brought to justice for the loss of that life."" Earlier this week, a police officer in Greenbrier, Tennessee, resigned after he was placed on leave because of a profanity-laced Facebook comment referencing the death of George Floyd. The officer later resigned. The city of Greenbrier confirmed that following the closed investigation, former Officer Cory Tidwell, ""was extremely apologetic and remorseful for any embarrassment he caused the City of Greenbrier and Greenbrier Police Department."" According to several screen captures, Tidwell wrote, without naming Floyd, ""If he was begging...HE WAS F---ING BREATHING STUPID F---S!!!!!!!!!....same old bulls--- over and over and over..."" The Tennessean redacted profanities for this story. Protests ripple nationwide Protesters take to the streets during a Justice for George Floyd rally in downtown Phoenix on May 28, 2020. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic) Floyd's death sparked protests across the nation — some that turned violent in several major cities. In Minneapolis, protesters angered by Floyd's death gained access to a police precinct on Thursday during the third night of violent protests spreading beyond the city. The protests unfurled as other cities saw similar demonstrations over police killings of black Americans, including Breonna Taylor, the 26-year-old Louisville emergency room tech who was shot and killed by Louisville Metro Police Department officers in March. At least seven people were shot Thursday night in downtown Louisville while others were arrested as hundreds of protesters gathered to demand justice for her death. Police officers did not fire their guns, the LPD spokeswoman Alicia Smiley said. On Thursday in Memphis, a silent demonstration intended to protest the deaths of Floyd, Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery turned into separate verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters.

The incident occurred earlier in the evening around 6PM. One officer used a sign from a protester to wave as a fan for the female to cool off (as seen below).  A short time later rallygoers headed to the Metro Courthouse where windows were broken, graffiti was spray-painted on courthouse walls, and small fires were set in the vicinity.  8 PM: Two trash cans that were bolted to the sidewalk in Nashville on Broadway were set on fire. The flames were short lived and quickly put out.  9 PM: Reports of plastic gallons of milk thrown at police officers. Governor Bill Lee called on the TN National Guard to step in during the protest.

MURFREESBORO VIGIL SCHEDULED FOR SUNDAY:  A vigil has been planned in Murfreesboro in honor of the man who died during a Minneapolis Police arrest this past week. The vigil will be on the local square Sunday afternoon between 3 and 6PM.  George Floyd was said to have died minutes after an officer of the law put his knee on his neck during what appeared to be a traffic stop while two other officers in Minneapolis were on his back and legs. A fourth officer was reported to be standing over the three other officers during the incident. All three of the officers who were allegedly holding the 46-year-old down have been fired.  Floyd lost consciousness 4 minutes into police holding him down. His death happened after his lifeless body was placed onto a stretcher by paramedics.  The case is still under investigation by the FBI.  Floyd worked security for Conga Latin Bistro, a small restaurant and bar that was known for their Spanish-Latin dishes.  The restaurant workers posted on their Facebook page, ""Everyone who met him knows he was a kind and respectful person, Rest In Peace, amazing still can't believe it.""  The vigil in Murfreesboro is being planned by a man named Mike McDougal. It will be on the Murfreesboro Square Sunday between 3 and 6pm. Reports indicate McDougal is asking for the those who attend the vigil to be peaceful.  BELOW: Photos posted by Conga Latin Bistro, where Floyd worked security in Minneapolis.

1621241399,2020-05-30 14:57:34,Memphis protesters march to site where Dr. King was killed,https://tri-statedefender.com/memphis-protesters-march-to-site-where-dr-king-was-killed/05/30/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=memphis-protesters-march-to-site-where-dr-king-was-killed,en,False,,284383,Welcome to The Tri-State Defender,http://tsdmemphis.com/,"by Adrian Sainz — A large group of protesters chanted loudly as they marched down streets Friday night in downtown Memphis, voicing their frustration and solidarity days after the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into his neck as he pleaded for air. For the second night in a row, a racially diverse flock of protesters gathered in front of the FedExForum, the basketball and concert venue near Beale Street in downtown Memphis. They walked toward the National Civil Rights Museum, the site where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed 52 years ago at what was then the Lorraine Motel. As they approached the museum, the protesters chanted “I Am a Man,” the rallying cry adopted by striking sanitation workers King came to Memphis to support in March and April 1968. Protesters knelt and had a moment of silence in front of the museum. Police blocked some streets but their presence was minimal, and the protest remained peaceful. Local TV stations showed the protest live on the Internet. Floyd’s death, and the killings in past months of a black man in Georgia and a black woman in Kentucky, have led to violent protests in Minneapolis, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio, and peaceful demonstrations in other cities. Four Minneapolis police officers were fired and investigations are underway after a white police officer was seen on video kneeling against the neck of Floyd. One of the officers has been arrested and charged with murder. Earlier Friday, Mayor Jim Strickland called for an investigation into whether an officer broke any rules after a video surfaced of a woman being knocked to the ground during a Wednesday protest related to Floyd’s death. Strickland said on social media that he’s asked Police Director Michael Rallings to investigate “an event that occurred Wednesday night with one of our officers and a female protester.” A video has been shared on television and social media that appears to show an officer shoving a woman to the ground. It’s not clear whether she was injured. More than 70 people gathered outside the police precinct in Midtown Memphis and then walked down Union Avenue on Wednesday night to protest Floyd’s death. Police set up barricades and blocked the avenue. Officers later donned helmets, protective shields and other riot gear as the situation became increasingly strained and raucous late into the night. Tensions were escalated by the presence of a man who was holding a sign referencing a Confederate group. Wednesday’s protest ended with five arrests and no visible property damage. But activists have questioned actions by police, including a lack of coronavirus-related social distancing, using barricades to limit the mobility of protesters, and wearing riot gear. Kimberly Dollar, who shot the video, said she did not realize she had captured the woman being knocked down until she got home from the protest and reviewed her Snapchat videos. “I didn’t see anything that was crazy from my standing, so I’m not exactly sure why they brought out the riot gear,” said Dollar, a 32-year-old restaurant server. “Apparently there was a target they were going for, and that girl was in the way, I guess.” Strickland has said he shares the protesters’ frustrations with the situation in Minnesota, but he criticized protesters who were not wearing masks and weren’t observing social distancing rules set forth in a city order because of the coronavirus pandemic. “By not doing so, protesters and our officers were unnecessarily put at risk,” Strickland said in a statement Thursday. The mayor’s statement also said he was proud of the way Memphis police officers conducted themselves. The Shelby County Democratic Party responded, saying it was officers who put lives in danger by placing protesters behind barricades and failing to stay 6 feet (2 meters) away from protesters and each other. Community activist and Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer has alleged police were responsible for escalating the protest. Sawyer, who challenged Strickland in the last mayoral election, had demanded an investigation into the incident in which the woman was knocked down. “I would love for the public to see a timeline on what that investigation looks like, and when the public will have a response on action,” Sawyer said in a phone interview Friday. “I would like the mayor to retract his statement that he was proud of the response of MPD.” Sawyer spoke at the protest Friday night, pledging to support them from her position in county government. “We can push the police from the outside and from the inside,” she said.

A march is scheduled to follow the rally. May 29 More than 24 cities continue to have protests. Now ex-officer Chauvin has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Vanderbilt posted the following statement regarding the incident: “The recent events in Minneapolis that led to the death of George Floyd have once again cast a spotlight on the challenges that African Americans and people of color face in this country. Mr. Floyd’s terrible, unnecessary and untimely death, as well as his treatment during his last seven minutes of life, again raises the existential question of whether some lives are more valued than others. Life is to be cherished and its protection falls on the shoulders of all of us, but even more importantly, on those given the authority to protect and defend our lives and laws. In all our roles as educators, scholars and stewards of the best ideas and values of a civil society, we must be part of the national chorus that cries out that all lives are valuable. Furthermore, as a community we should question why incidents such as these continue to occur, and what role we can play in creating a fairer and just world. At Vanderbilt, equity, diversity and inclusion are a major and treasured part of our ethos, and we do not tolerate racism, prejudice, hatred or violence in any form.” May 28 Protests continued in Minneapolis and eventually escalated to the burning of the Minneapolis Third Precinct police station. Other protests broke out in other cities including Denver, Colorado; Columbus, Ohio; Phoenix, Arizona and New York City, New York. May 27 Protests in Minneapolis escalated as Target and other local businesses were raided. May 26 The four officers involved in the incident were all fired by the Minneapolis Police Department. Thousands gathered to protest in Minneapolis. May 25 George Floyd, 46, was involved in an incident with four police officers on May 25, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Four police officers restrained a handcuffed Floyd with one officer, Derek Chauvin, placing his knee on Floyd’s neck. Eventually, Floyd was taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center and was pronounced dead 9:25 p.m. later that day. The video of the incident has since been widely shared across social media and may be disturbing to watch.",0.0

Twelve were arrested, including several from out of town. After the arrests the group of around 150 protestors surrounded the downtown jail and courts area before finally dispersing around 3 a.m. There were several separate protests downtown on Saturday relating to the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. Marchers yelled ""No Justice. No Peace"" as they marched across the Walnut Street Bridge early Saturday evening. Police said they tried to break up the large ""rancorous"" crowd unsuccessfully for around three hours, then acts of vandalism and confrontations with officers began around 11 p.m. in North Chattanooga. They continued for several more tense hours. Officers who were summoned to the scene included Chattanooga Police, Sheriff's officers and Tennessee Highway Patrol. Police Chief David Roddy was at the scene throughout the day attempting to communicate with the group. The protestors occupied all four lanes of the Market Street Bridge as they headed toward the north side of the river. At the intersection of Market and Frazier they began a ""sit in"" at the busy intersection. Ordered to quit blocking the roadway, the group rose and began marching down the center of Frazier Avenue heading east. A pedestrian lane was open and attempts were made to steer the group toward Coolidge Park. The group resisted and camped at the intersection of Frazier and Tremont, while completely taking over the eastbound lanes. Officers formed a line and were able to move the protestors off the roadway, then there was a surge back onto Frazier by the group, police said. At this time Caleb Jenkins, Erica Chacon, Taira Truss and Colby Prigmore were taken into custody. Jenkins is from 404 Coffee Lane, Loudon, Tn. Ms. Chacon is from 175 Corvin Meadows Lane, Dayton, Tn., Ms. Truss is from 709 N. Holly St., and Prigmore is from 210 Railroad St., Dayton, Tn. Police also arrested Sydnie R. Jeffers, of 901 Mountain Creek Road, Apt. 155, for refusing repeated commands to get out of the roadway. Police said prior to 1 a.m., the large group headed back toward downtown over the Walnut Street Bridge. They ""proceeded to travel around the city damaging property all over the downtown area. They went as far south as MLK Boulevard, then along Chestnut ""continuing to damage property around the city."" At 7th and Market, an officer took Kristin Holloway, of 821 W. 14th St. Court, into custody for ""obstructing a roadway when asked, inciting a riot, and disorderly conduct."" Police said he refused to move out of the roadway and was also seen knocking a civilian down. They next gathered near Buffalo Wild Wings at 100 Market St. just before 1 a.m. They ""were continually ordered to peacefully disperse."" Police said two individuals began throwing rocks at officers. They said Denishia Price, of 261 Long Island Road, South Pittsburg, was taken into custody after a chase. Police said during this arrest an individual named Dylan Hardwick approached police yelling. He ""was detained until police could calm the scene down."" Hardwick, of 4112 E. Stump St., East Ridge, was arrested. A large rock was then thrown at officers seeking to disperse the crowd. It struck a patrol car and came close to an officer who was standing behind the vehicle. At that point an officer noticed an individual in a dark shirt running up the hill from Market Street toward the Hunter Museum. The officer said he began to crest the hill at Aquarium Way as bits of concrete were still being thrown at him. Another officer joined in the pursuit as they got to the top of the hill and saw two individuals running away. The pair refused commands to halt. The officers caught up with the pair at the Hunter Museum. One of the officers drew his tazer on Skyler Dover and he took the tazer away. An officer said he then ""stunned (Dover) in the small of his back and it was effective."" Dover, of 1406 Morris Hill Road, was then taken into custody along with the female with him. Back at Market Street near Buffalo Wild Wings officers formed a line to try to keep protestors from entering the streets. Police said a white male tried to push through the line of officers and physically made contact with them. Police said the man, Eric L. Morton, of 310 Marilyn Dr., Jasper, Tn., again tried to push through officers and became physical. It took several officers to take him to the ground and get him into custody, it was stated. At the same location, police said Darryon Wood pushed officers and tried to assist a friend to get away. Wood, of 1109 E. 8th St., was then taken into custody. A short time later, police said an officer was pushed by Shaun McAfee, of 1446 Bradt St. McAfee was removed from the protest area and taken into custody. Click here for video of the march on Walnut Street. In Nashville protestors set fire to the courthouse. They also toppled a statue to Edward Ward Carmack, a politician and newspaperman who had a running battle with civil rights activist Ida B. Wells. Tennessee Governor Bill Lee responded by calling out the National Guard, and a 10 p.m. curfew was set. The governor said, ""At the request of Mayor Cooper, I am authorizing the National Guard to mobilize in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville.

Luxurious houses, gardens, a mostly white neighborhood. Nothing before last Monday, when African-American George Floyd died in police custody, sparking a wave of protests, indicated that this affluent neighborhood in southern Minneapolis would become a battlefield. A police station set alight, vandalized shops and a burning bank – damage to property is extensive, but among the hundreds of volunteers who have come to the area with shovels, brooms and dustpans, stoicism reigns, and in some cases even sympathy towards the protesters. “Today I knew that my city was suffering and I wanted to do something,” Mike, who lives near the area hardest hit by the riots on Friday, told EFE. This white, middle-aged man wearing a hat to protect himself from the sun decided to go outside during the day not to protest, but to fix the damage. When the volunteers begin to arrive, the scene is bleak and many compare it to a battlefield. The fire at the bank has continued all morning. The smell of smoke permeates the area and the looted business premises are full of broken glass and flooded by fire sprinklers. Heather has joined this makeshift brigade of volunteers along with a group of friends, almost all of them in their thirties. “When you see something like this and you see it affecting local businesses and neighborhood families, helping is the best you can do,” she told EFE. These same reasons were repeated among the group. They do not recognize the Minneapolis of chaos and the destruction that has been broadcast around the world since Floyd’s death on Monday and the outbreak of unrest on Tuesday, although they understand it. “For us having a week of being scared is nothing compared to always being scared, so what is happening seems to me a blessing… it has forced us to understand,” said Heather’s friend Phil. Allison is a volunteer cleaning the streets Saturday and who participated in the protests Friday night, although she left early to comply with the curfew that began at 8 pm. “When you don’t pay attention to a protest, what comes next is riots,” she said. In a systematic way, the spontaneously organized volunteer brigades go store by store, sweeping up broken glass, removing damaged materials, and draining accumulated water onto the street, while the owners take inventory of the damage. It is more difficult to take stock at the bank branch and the post office, which were targets of protesters for being government-owned and the structures of which collapsed in the flames. Among the remains of the bank, Ecuadorian José is not so tolerant of what happened over the past few nights: “I know that we all have the right to protest, but not in this way.” “There is a problem with the police. With this there may be a change – from everyone, not just from the police,” he reflected. EFE-EPA at/tw",0.0

Ray Wilson, a Columbia resident who called for a local demonstration, said it peacefully brought the city into the national conversation as ongoing protests, violence and unrest continue across the nation. The story: https://t.co/i2lCUvXWtY pic.twitter.com/gTMvtIzvBv — Mike Christen (@MikeChristenCDH) May 31, 2020 Ray Kwaan Wilson, who took to social media to call on friends and acquaintances to stand with him in front of the courthouse in solidarity for the lives lost, said the local turnout peacefully brought Columbia into the national conversation following a week of violence and unrest in Minnesota, Kentucky and Georgia and other communities across the nation. “Hopefully a change will happen,” Wilson told The Daily Herald, as more arrived to take part in the peaceful demonstration. “It’s not just this one incident. It’s not just this one time, or this last few times. It’s been hundreds of years. We are still fighting the same fight.” Strangers parked on the square to join as others gave supportive honks and waves while driving through the downtown square. “This is my first demonstration,” said one man joining the growing crowd. “Let’s get this started.” Others shared a different opinion, with revving engines and prolonged glares. Local business owners and members of the Columbia Police Department offered water and coffee to the more than a dozen demonstrators who stood on the county square holding signs that read “I can’t breath.” “You can do something in your own city and still be heard,” Wilson said. “Yesterday, I woke up and something just told me that we should do something here.” The local demonstration occurred as preparations were being made for the “I Will Breathe” protest in downtown Nashville. The event later turned to unrest as a day of peaceful speeches and marching ended and gave way to a night of violence and destruction with storefronts damaged and fire set to the Davidson County Courthouse. A statue outside the state Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who was a prohibitionist leader known for racist views and opposition of Tennessee journalist Ida B. Wells who is now known as “Mother of the Civil Rights Movement,” was torn to the ground. Carmack, a graduate of the prestigious Webb School when it was located in Culleoka, became a Columbia city attorney in 1881 and was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives three years later before serving in the United States House of Representatives. “I am a resident of Columbia so I should protest here,” Wilson said. “We are doing this not just for Mr. George Floyd but for the hundred of thousands of other people who face injustice and we are doing it peacefully.” Wilson says he and others plan to hold a march during the upcoming weekend. “Hopefully we can get everybody, the police chief, the mayor and we all march together in unity and solidarity,” Wilson said. Wilson, who works for Columbia’s Parks and Recreation Department, said the day served as an example that a small few, with no previous connection to one another, can make their voices heard. “If you want to fight for something that you feel is right, you can do it,” Wilson said. “I am just a regular citizen. It’s sad. People are hurt. When people have pain and feel they are not heard, it turns into anger, it turns into frustration, it boils over and it explodes. I personally don’t condone looting and rioting, but I can understand why it is going on.” Wilson said the frustration will continue to build following the announcement that Derek Chauvin, the officer arrested in connection to Floyd’s death, faces charges of third-degree murder, rather than the heftier potential sentence that comes with a first-degree murder charge. “If justice is not sought, I pray that things will calm down,” Wilson said. But in all reality, things could get real ugly.” The demonstration ended with a prayer. “This is time for prayer,” Wilson said. “Hopefully it comes to a point of understanding and help everyone think clearly to a better way to resolve issues. It is really sad. People are frustrated. Hopefully it will calm down in the next few days. All we can do is pray.” Serreta Boson, who stood on the courthouse steps raising her fist in salute when passing cars honked, said that Colombia has the potential to serve as an example to the rest of the nation. “This is how it starts,” Boson said. “I get the anger. It’s time out for the excuses. We as a community have got to come together to support each other. We want to protect our community and ensure it does not happen here.” A former employee of the Columbia Police Department, Boson commended the work of newly appointed Columbia Police Chief Jeremy Alsup and Columbia Mayor Chaz Molder. She said that the local police department should give its officers more diversity training and provide other resources to its officers. “I think we have the right people in place right now to really make a change,” Boson said. “This is an opportunity for Columbia to be on the map for change. This is a sleepy little town that has a lot of potential. This is about our way of life. The atmosphere is perfect for unity. It is perfect for a miracle and it could start right here in Columbia.” She said that in the end it is up to the people of Columbia and Maury County to make sure their voices are heard. “We have got to pray our way through this,” Boson said. “We have got to love our way through this and we have got to vote our way through this,” Boson said. “Columbia is in a position to be an example for the rest of the country.” Molder, who has served as the city’s mayor since January of 2019, shared his support for those demonstrating and the police officers who peacefully stood with them. “Our country has a lot of work ahead. We are hurt. We need peace. We need understanding,” Molder said on social media. “My vision is for Columbia to be the shining star and blaze trails in the days, weeks and months to come. Today was a good start. Together we can lead the way and we will.” On Friday, Molder called the deaths of Floyd, Taylor and Ahmed Aubry an “issue of generations.” “Right now — in Minnesota, Kentucky and Georgia — these three souls should be pursuing their God given and constitutionally guaranteed freedom to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” Molder said. “Instead, their families are grieving. I am a white man, married to a white woman. I do not know what it is like to be afraid of getting pulled over. Liz and I will never have to talk with our son about how to interact with an officer if he gets stopped alone coming home from a basketball game.” The mayor, who last summer joined fellow community leaders on a journey to Alabama where they visited the sites of pivotal moments in the history of the Civil Rights Movement, shared a sentiment that the work of healing is far from over. “Many are coming face to face with our own privilege,” Molder said. “We are struggling to comprehend a concept black and brown community’s have lived with forever — those sworn to protect us sometimes do not. And, sometimes do harm.” However the mayor shared confidence in the work of Columbia’s own members of law enforcement. The mayor said the men and women of the Columbia Police Department should not be guilty by association with the actions of others and that those in the local department serve with honor and a dedication to building trust with members of the community. “They serve with honor,” Molder said. “They are as concerned about keeping the trust of our community as the community is concerned about maintaining trust in them.” As local community groups including the Stand Together Fellowship, a group of local religious and political leaders from a variety of different rational and spiritual backgrounds, have done so in the past, the mayor calls on the people of Columbia to share their worries for the community. “I want to hear your concerns about policing,” Molder said. “About equity, about inclusion — about how you think we should have these kinds of conversations in the community.”",0.0
1621269348,2020-05-30 20:08:18,"Protests heat up across US, governors call in National Guard",https://www.wjhl.com/news/protests-heat-up-across-us-governors-call-in-national-guard/,en,True,,194337,wjhl.com,http://wjhl.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Governors in several states called in National Guard troops as protests over repeated police killings of black men grew Saturday from New York to Cleveland (video above) to Tulsa to Los Angeles, where police fired rubber bullets to scatter crowds and at least one police car burned. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Monday’s death of George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of that city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. But the demonstrations have since become a national phenomenon, as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. In Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. Other peaceful protests were being held in California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. In Tulsa and Wilmington, Delaware, protesters made their way onto nearby interstates and shut them down temporarily. In Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck drove through a crowd of protesters, sending some running and screaming as the vehicle stopped and started and at one point had a person on its hood, police said, but no serious injuries were reported. In Columbia, South Carolina, a television reporter for WIS-TV was injured by rocks thrown Saturday amid protests outside the Columbia Police Department. Several hundred people participated in the demonstration, tearing down the American and state flags in front of the police department’s headquarters. They also swarmed a Columbia police car, breaking its windows, The State reported. In Los Angeles protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move protesters back and shot rubber bullets to scatter the crowd. One man used a skateboard to attempt to break the windshield of a police SUV. A spray painted police car burned in the streets. In Minneapolis, 29-year-old Sam Allkija, said at Saturday’s protest that the destruction that has accompanied protests is a sign of the frustration and rage the black community has felt for a long time. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful protests in dozens of cities. The previous day’s protests, too, had started calmly — in cities from New York to Oakland, California, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon — before many descended into violence. The massive crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for the spread of the coronavirus. Hundreds of people were arrested Friday, and police used batons, rubber bullets and pepper spray to push back crowds in some cities. Many departments reported officers were injured, while social media was awash in images of police using forceful tactics, throwing protesters to the ground, using bicycles as shields, and trampling a protester while on horseback. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals in Los Angeles. During the five days of rioting in 1992, more than 60 died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. On Friday, the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — but that appeared to provide little balm. Many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Comments from President Donald Trump stoked the anger, when he fired off a series of tweets criticizing Minnesota’s response, ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would … have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and offered sympathy for those who were protesting — but as unrest intensified, many spoke of the desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy handed tactics. The unrest prompted responses across the globe. A top Vatican cardinal, Peter Turkson who is from Ghana, urged pastors in the United States to plead for calm, while U.S. national soccer player Weston McKennie wore an armband referencing Floyd’s death while playing for Schalke in Germany’s Bundesliga. Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. The governor is also considering a potential offer of military police, which the Pentagon put on alert. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, and Cincinnati. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. And police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who had climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. Atlanta saw some of the most extreme unrest. While crews in that city worked to clean up glass and debris from rioting the night before, a large electronic billboard on Saturday morning still carried the message, “If you love Atlanta PLEASE GO HOME,” echoing the mayor’s pleas. National Guard members blocked anyone from approaching heavily damaged buildings, including the College Football Hall of Fame and nearby restaurants. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Underscoring that Floyd’s killing is part of a pattern, the names of black people killed by police, including Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.”",0.0

West Tennesseans came together to hold a protest in honor of George Floyd on Saturday. “We come from a multi-racial family. Four of our children are African-American and one is Caucasian,” said Medina resident Jessica Clark. Clark says she’s concerned about her children’s safety as they get older. “Are they going to get scared in a situation and do something that people would think was aggressive and get shot or hurt because of something they were scared of?” Clark said. That’s why she joined hundreds of others in front of Jackson City Hall for a peaceful protest. “The diversity is tremendous. Anyone that says this county, this city, doesn’t care about the plight of others, particularly those in the African-American community or the Asian and Hispanic communities, is dead wrong,” said NAACP Jackson-Madison County Branch President Harrell Carter. Many also honored other black men and women who died in similar situations. “The residents of Jackson are speaking, and they’re saying injustice is not okay here. It is not okay in Minnesota. It is not okay in our world. It has no place,” said event organizer Kabao McCarver. It wasn’t just Jackson residents. Others came in from surrounding counties to make their voice heard. “Last night, we both just decided we had to do something. We have to stand up and be a part of it,” said Trenton resident Dawn Gordon. “I really do think that white people really need to be more involved, and I think that’s one of the areas we keep letting this happen,” Gordon said. Lane College student Darryl Clarke says it means a lot to see everyone come together and show their support. “We’re getting support from all corners, all which ways. I love it,” Clarke said. “I’m feeling the love and I see all of the supporters out here, and they’re being peaceful and not looting or anything like that.” Protesters say they want to see an end to all racial injustice. “We’ve got to raise our children to love each other, regardless of skin color,” Clark said. “There’s hope in coming together, and it says that each person is a person,” Carter said. The Jackson Police Department released information on steps they’re taking to ensure safety, such as Crisis Intervention Training, Just and Fair Policing and more. In response to Floyd’s death, Jackson Mayor Scott Conger says they diligently work to make certain nothing like this happens in our city.

Smith called out to his concert audience in Franklin, Tennessee, on Saturday. “Is anybody in the house?” It was a tricky question. Sure, there was a sea of people spread out in front of his stage — and behind it, too. But this crowd was categorically out of the house, and celebrating that fact. Smith, a mainstay of Christian music for the last 35 years, provided the Nashville area with its first major “drive-in” concert on Saturday. He and his band did so on the vast, steep-hilled parking lot of the Williamson County Ag Expo Park, where organizers expected more than 1,000 vehicles. Michael W. Smith performs during a drive-in concert at the Williamson County Ag Expo Park Saturday May 30, 2020. (Photo: Alan Poizner) The crowd members watched from their cars — either on their roofs, from their SUV trunks and pickup beds, or on lawn chairs in front of their parking spots. At the end of that first song, “Open The Eyes of My Heart,” they responded with a mix of cheers and a few scattered honked horns. “That’s a first,” Smith noted. The honks grew bolder as the sun set, and as everyone involved seemed to get more comfortable with a wholly new experience. In fact, it was the loudest sound you heard ringing across the lot. There were no loudspeakers, aside from the on-stage monitors. Like you’d do at a drive-in theater, the audience members tuned their car radios to a local frequency to hear the show. Smith’s crew didn’t skimp on the visual side, putting up four large video screens to provide a view to all sides of the audience, and a live video feed that included overhead drone shots in real time. When he spoke with The Tennessean a week prior, Smith said he hoped to be a “voice of calm” during the pandemic. But he didn’t know this weekend would also see a wave of demonstrations held across the U.S. in response to the death of George Floyd. Following a peaceful protest in Nashville Saturday afternoon, pockets of violence had emerged. While Smith was on stage, fires were being set 20 miles north at the Metro Courthouse, and officers had deployed tear gas. Earlier this week, Smith had offered a response to Floyd’s death, sharing the remarks of gospel star CeCe Winans on social media. She prayed for comfort to Floyd’s family, “justice to all” and the end of “racism in authority.” On Saturday, Smith touched on the present with a prayer, leading up to “The Heart of Worship.” “Lord, at this very moment, our country’s in trouble. Riots going on. Rapidly declining. We call upon your name, O God. ... We’re all gonna have different opinions of this and that and whatever. We’re not here to talk about that. We’re just crying out to God. We need you. We need you. Nothing else can fix this problem but you. You’re the answer.” Before the coronavirus put the entire concert industry on pause, Smith had just begun a new leg of his “35 Years of Friends” tour, marking 35 years since his breakthrough hit, “Friends.” But he’s also had reason to celebrate the present, as he recently scored his first (non-Christmas) No. 1 hit since 2004, “Waymaker.” The song, penned and originally recorded by Nigerian gospel star Sinach, praises God as a “miracle worker” and a “light in the darkness.” Smith told The Tennessean it was ""the right song for the time we're living in.” But decades-old songs seemed to connect as well, including “Love One Another,” his crossover hit “Place In This World” and “Friends,” which closed Saturday’s concert. ""If you don't have enough faith, all of us on this stage have lots of faith for you,” Smith said before that last song. “Whatever trial, whatever COVID brought your way, God is bigger than that. And so I pray as we wind this night down, that healing comes into your heart, you get a bigger understanding of who God really, really is. And he's absolutely in love with you. And he just wants to be your friend, at the end of the day. Friendship with God, there's nothing better. I will never forget this night for the rest of my entire life. We made history!""

Around 30 cities, from Los Angeles to Chicago, passing through Cleveland, Washington DC and New York, were the scenes of protests against the death of 46-year-old African American man George Floyd, who died at the hands of the police on May 25 in Minneapolis. Crowds gathered in Minneapolis minutes before the 8 pm (01:00 GMT) curfew ordered by authorities in the Fifth Precinct area, where on Friday a bank and a police station were burned down. Later, a reporter on the scene tweeted that state police in riot gear were advancing after peaceful protesters defied curfew, and that rubber bullets and tear gas had been fired. Burned-out police cars, blocked roads, broken glass and the launching of projectiles were scenes repeated in various parts of the US, whilst police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. Several thousand protesters demonstrated for the third consecutive day in New York, burning police vehicles in Brooklyn and cutting off traffic on various roads, with tense moments involving batons and pepper spray in simultaneous marches that traveled the five districts of the Big Apple, until they passed Trump Tower. Police also detained two sisters for throwing a Molotov cocktail at the police on Friday. In Washington, DC, new altercations between the Secret Service, police and protesters took place for the second consecutive night in the vicinity of the White House. More than 1,000 protesters gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue and some threw bricks, stones and bottles until they were dispersed by the Secret Service. There was also a clash with the Secret Service after a fence was knocked down. Hours later, as evening fell, hundreds of protesters gathered near Lafayette Square, the park in front of the White House, the access to which had been closed. There, security measures were reinforced with metal barriers and a greater deployment of law enforcement personnel and vehicles, which were damaged by protesters. At around 10pm, police fired tear gas. President Donald Trump warned that if protesters had breached the White House fence they would “have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” On the west coast, the Seattle Police Department reported in a statement that “following several hours of peaceful demonstration, the crowd became violent and aggressive and began to throw bottles at officers. Members of the crowd also threw fireworks towards people attending the rally.” As a result of these altercations, several protesters and officers were injured, police said. Local television was broadcasting images of burning vehicles, while Governor Jay Inslee said he had activated 200 members of the National Guard, and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan tweeted that she would “soon be signing an emergency order and the @CityofSeattle will be imposing a 5 pm curfew soon. Crowds need to disburse from downtown immediately.” In Philadelphia, rally participants vandalized a police vehicle, and painted and attempted to tear down the statue of former mayor Frank Rizzo in the city center. Rizzo, who died in 1991, was a police commissioner known for his firm hand. Meanwhile, in places such as Chicago and Los Angeles, protesters clashed with police, who reportedly fired rubber bullets. The Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety in Pennsylvania said on Twitter that several police officers had been injured during riots, while three journalists had been injured or attacked by protesters. In Miami, Florida, protesters staged riots that were dispersed by law enforcement, after a peaceful rally earlier in the day. The protesters set fire to several police cars and smashed street furniture until at 10 pm the riot teams dispersed the crowds using tear gas and rubber bullets. The authorities of other states such as Georgia, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Colorado, Ohio and Utah joined Minnesota on Saturday to order the mobilization of the National Guard to deal with the unrest. Several cities have decreed a curfew, including Atlanta, where protests were especially violent on Friday. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms ordered a curfew on Saturday from 9 pm local time until dawn. Similar measures have been taken in Cleveland, Ohio; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Los Angeles, California; Louisville, Kentucky; Denver, Colorado; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Hundreds of protesters gathered on and near Legislative Plaza around 3 p.m. for the “I Will Breathe” rally. Wearing masks and holding signs, attendees issued chants of “Justice for George Floyd,” “black lives matter” and “no justice, no peace” as speakers addressed the crowd. The gathering, which was organized by a loose affiliation of activists, came in conjunction with demonstrations around the country inspired by the death of George Floyd, who was killed when Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Speakers at the “I Will Breathe” rally included members of Metro and state government, among them Mayor John Cooper, state Rep. Vincent Dixie, state Rep. Mike Stewart, state Rep. Harold Love and state Sen. Brenda Gilmore. Nashville NAACP president Keith Caldwell addressed the crowd, telling those gathered that it was the biggest group he’d seen at the plaza in his many years of activism. Others, including activist Justin Jones, called for deep systemic change, referencing the killings of black men — including Daniel Hambrick and Jocques Clemmons, both of whom were shot and killed by members of the Metro Nashville Police Department. “We cannot change hearts,” said Rep. Dixie at one point. “We cannot change minds. But what we can do is change laws. Make sure you register to vote. I’m angry. I’m mad as hell, but I can’t let it consume me.” After roughly two hours of speakers and peaceful demonstration, the protesters dispersed to march east on Martin Luther King Boulevard. At one point, those marching headed down Lower Broadway, with people in Honky Tonk Central looking down at the crowds from the bar’s windows. Not long after, crowds gathered near MNPD’s Central Precinct on Korean Veterans Boulevard, where the scene quickly became chaotic. With officers lined up in front of the precinct, crowds smashed out the windows of one police cruiser, with others throwing rocks at the building. At least half a dozen people in the crowd were detained by MNPD, with some officers wearing riot gear dispersed to protect the building. Mounted police were also present. See videos from those events in this thread. After the events at the Central Precinct, crowds moved toward City Hall. Some destruction continued to unfold, with the statue of Edward W. Carmack at the state Capitol pulled down by protesters, and messages including ""Fuck Trump"" and ""BLM"" spray-painted on the walls of City Hall. One member of the crowd told the Scene he was pepper-sprayed by police. As the night wore on, crowds lit fires at the Metro Courthouse, tossing flaming pieces of paper in through the broken windows of the building. Metro police employed tear gas to disperse the crowd, with Mayor Cooper declaring a state of emergency and setting a 10 p.m. curfew. The Equity Alliance, one of the city's most prominent black advocacy organizations, addressed the escalating situation in a statement on Twitter. ""Today's protest was peaceful and unified,"" they wrote. ""We witnessed white people defacing public property while marching and told them to stop. The people now attempting to set fire to the Metro Courthouse right now are NOT associated with today's peaceful protest rally. It ain't us."" Following Cooper's emergency declaration, Gov. Bill Lee announced that he'd mobilized the National Guard. “At the request of Mayor Cooper, I am authorizing the National Guard to mobilize in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville,"" Lee said in a written statement. ""The threat to both peace and property is unacceptable and we will work with local law enforcement and community leaders to restore safety and order. This is not a reflection of our state or the fundamental American right to peaceful protest.” See photos from today's events below. We will update this post as the story develops.

1621292588,2020-05-30 21:44:23,"Protests heat up across US, governors call in National Guard",https://www.wate.com/news/protests-heat-up-across-us-governors-call-in-national-guard/,en,True,,84580,wate.com,http://www.wate.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Governors in several states called in National Guard troops as protests over repeated police killings of black men grew Saturday from New York to Cleveland (video above) to Tulsa to Los Angeles, where police fired rubber bullets to scatter crowds and at least one police car burned. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Monday’s death of George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of that city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. But the demonstrations have since become a national phenomenon, as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. In Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. Other peaceful protests were being held in California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. In Tulsa and Wilmington, Delaware, protesters made their way onto nearby interstates and shut them down temporarily. In Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck drove through a crowd of protesters, sending some running and screaming as the vehicle stopped and started and at one point had a person on its hood, police said, but no serious injuries were reported. In Columbia, South Carolina, a television reporter for WIS-TV was injured by rocks thrown Saturday amid protests outside the Columbia Police Department. Several hundred people participated in the demonstration, tearing down the American and state flags in front of the police department’s headquarters. They also swarmed a Columbia police car, breaking its windows, The State reported. In Los Angeles protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move protesters back and shot rubber bullets to scatter the crowd. One man used a skateboard to attempt to break the windshield of a police SUV. A spray painted police car burned in the streets. In Minneapolis, 29-year-old Sam Allkija, said at Saturday’s protest that the destruction that has accompanied protests is a sign of the frustration and rage the black community has felt for a long time. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful protests in dozens of cities. The previous day’s protests, too, had started calmly — in cities from New York to Oakland, California, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon — before many descended into violence. The massive crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for the spread of the coronavirus. Hundreds of people were arrested Friday, and police used batons, rubber bullets and pepper spray to push back crowds in some cities. Many departments reported officers were injured, while social media was awash in images of police using forceful tactics, throwing protesters to the ground, using bicycles as shields, and trampling a protester while on horseback. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals in Los Angeles. During the five days of rioting in 1992, more than 60 died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. On Friday, the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — but that appeared to provide little balm. Many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Comments from President Donald Trump stoked the anger, when he fired off a series of tweets criticizing Minnesota’s response, ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would … have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and offered sympathy for those who were protesting — but as unrest intensified, many spoke of the desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy handed tactics. The unrest prompted responses across the globe. A top Vatican cardinal, Peter Turkson who is from Ghana, urged pastors in the United States to plead for calm, while U.S. national soccer player Weston McKennie wore an armband referencing Floyd’s death while playing for Schalke in Germany’s Bundesliga. Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. The governor is also considering a potential offer of military police, which the Pentagon put on alert. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, and Cincinnati. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. And police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who had climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. Atlanta saw some of the most extreme unrest. While crews in that city worked to clean up glass and debris from rioting the night before, a large electronic billboard on Saturday morning still carried the message, “If you love Atlanta PLEASE GO HOME,” echoing the mayor’s pleas. National Guard members blocked anyone from approaching heavily damaged buildings, including the College Football Hall of Fame and nearby restaurants. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Underscoring that Floyd’s killing is part of a pattern, the names of black people killed by police, including Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” LATEST STORIES:",0.0

Around 30 cities, from Los Angeles to Chicago, passing through Cleveland, Washington DC and New York, were the scenes of protests against the death of 46-year-old African American man George Floyd, who died at the hands of the police on May 25 in Minneapolis. Crowds gathered in Minneapolis minutes before the 8 pm (01:00 GMT) curfew ordered by authorities in the Fifth Precinct area, where on Friday a bank and a police station were burned down. Later, a reporter on the scene tweeted that state police in riot gear were advancing after peaceful protesters defied curfew, and that rubber bullets and tear gas had been fired. Burned-out police cars, blocked roads, broken glass and the launching of projectiles were scenes repeated in various parts of the US, whilst police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti on Saturday imposed an 8 pm curfew in the city after another day of violent protests against which police were deployed in full force to try and pacify the situation. The satellite towns of Pasadena and Santa Monica also imposed curfews and deployed police on the streets. Garcetti followed the example of other US cities and called in 500 members of the National Guard to control the situation after clashes led to over 530 arrests and six police officers getting injured between Friday night and the early hours of Saturday. On Saturday a peaceful protest deteriorated into a number of shops, pharmacies and other businesses being looted in the city center, while a small police station was set on fire. In New York City, several thousand protesters demonstrated, burning police vehicles in Brooklyn and cutting off traffic on various roads, with tense moments involving batons and pepper spray in simultaneous marches that traveled the five districts of the Big Apple, until they passed Trump Tower. Police also detained two sisters for throwing a Molotov cocktail at the police on Friday. In Washington, DC, new altercations between the Secret Service, police and protesters took place for the second consecutive night in the vicinity of the White House. More than 1,000 protesters gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue and some threw bricks, stones and bottles until they were dispersed by the Secret Service. There was also a clash with the Secret Service after a fence was knocked down. Hours later, as evening fell, hundreds of protesters gathered near Lafayette Square, the park in front of the White House, the access to which had been closed. There, security measures were reinforced with metal barriers and a greater deployment of law enforcement personnel and vehicles, which were damaged by protesters. At around 10pm, police fired tear gas. President Donald Trump warned that if protesters had breached the White House fence they would “have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” On the west coast, the Seattle Police Department reported in a statement that “following several hours of peaceful demonstration, the crowd became violent and aggressive and began to throw bottles at officers. Members of the crowd also threw fireworks towards people attending the rally.” As a result of these altercations, several protesters and officers were injured, police said. Local television was broadcasting images of burning vehicles, while Governor Jay Inslee said he had activated 200 members of the National Guard, and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan tweeted that she would “soon be signing an emergency order and the @CityofSeattle will be imposing a 5 pm curfew.” In Philadelphia, rally participants vandalized a police vehicle, and painted and attempted to tear down the statue of former mayor Frank Rizzo in the city center. Rizzo, who died in 1991, was a police commissioner known for his firm hand. The Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety in Pennsylvania said on Twitter that several police officers had been injured during riots, while three journalists had been injured or attacked by protesters. In Miami, Florida, protesters staged riots that were dispersed by law enforcement, after a peaceful rally earlier in the day. The protesters set fire to several police cars and smashed street furniture until at 10 pm the riot teams dispersed the crowds using tear gas and rubber bullets. Several cities have decreed a curfew, including Atlanta, where protests were especially violent on Friday. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms ordered a curfew on Saturday from 9 pm local time until dawn.

The Frente Nacional Ciudadano (Citizens’ National Front) and the Congreso Nacional Ciudadano (Citizens’ National Congress), groups opposed to the government, protested in 70 cities across Mexico in vehicle convoys. The convoys, called “Lopez Vete Ya” (Lopez, quit already), were aimed at expressing indignation towards the president, who the protesters accused of jeopardizing the “sovereignty, integrity and independence” of Mexico amid the coronavirus crisis. The groups confirmed that convoys were organized in the capital and major cities including Puebla, Cuernavaca, Acapulco, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Cancun, Merida and Veracruz as well as different places in the states of Queretaro and Chihuahua. As the vehicles passed through the main streets of the cities, the cars displayed posters with messages such as “AMLO (president’s initials), Out!” “AMLO, Resign. You Don’t Own Mexico.” In Mexico City, the protest began just before noon near the National Auditorium and moved across the central Paseo de Reforma Avenue to enter the Plaza de Constitution (Constitution Square), where they protested in front of the National Palace, the residence and office of the president. “I did not want him as president and he is doing a lot of damage to the country, so we do not want him… He is a totally corrupt person. He is destroying entrepreneurs,” Elsa Gonzalez Cabrada, one of the protesters in the capital, told EFE. According to police officials cited by local media outlets, around 250 vehicles and 300 protesters participated in the protest in the capital. In Puebla, 120 kilometers (75 miles) southeast of Mexico City, hundreds of vehicles drove in a caravan and honked along the main roads of the city, with many carrying posters displaying the protest’s motto. The demonstrations come towards the end of social distancing measures imposed since March to contain the coronavirus epidemic, as authorities have announced a gradual resumption of normalcy. Health authorities have said that restrictions would be lifted slowly from Jun. 1 based on a four-colored “traffic light” system to determine which actions would be allowed for individuals and businesses, with red denominating the most high-risk areas, followed by orange, yellow and green to mark progressively lower risks of infections.

Nashville's Metro Courthouse, which includes City Hall offices, and several businesses on Broadway were been damaged, police said. 11 p.m. The Equity Alliance, one of the organizers of Saturday's ""I Will Breathe Rally,"" condemned the violent protests and vandalism that took place in downtown Nashville following the rally. Leaders of the statewide non-profit issued the following statement attributed to co-founders and co-executive directors Charlane Oliver and Tequila Johnson: “Our organization, in cooperation with other activists, held a peaceful rally today to protest the murder of Minneapolis resident George Floyd by police as well as to deliver a clear message to Metro and state government leaders that Tennesseans deeply oppose racism and police brutality. The event drew some 4,000 attendees and our staff registered over 300 new voters. It was a peaceful assembly. “It is our firm belief that those individuals defacing and destroying public property after the rally were not a part of the original event. The actions by this small group reflect neither the beliefs of the groups that led today’s peaceful assembly nor those of the majority of the attendees. This behavior dishonors the memory of George Floyd and other black Americans that have died unjustly at the hands of police. “The Equity Alliance condemns and disavows tonight’s violent rioting. We urge anyone feeling heartfelt, honest anger over the murder of George Floyd to direct that energy toward November’s election. The only true way to change our nation for the better is by taking up our civic duty as Americans and making it clear with our vote that we reject racism in all its forms.” 10:38 p.m. A window was broken at the historic Ryman Auditorium in downtown Nashville tonight.

Carmack, an early 1900s politician and newspaper editor, was known for authoring editorials attacking fellow Tennessee journalist Ida B. Wells' writings in support of the civil rights movement, including encouraging retaliation against her, resulting in the burning of her Memphis newspaper office.

Organizers urged participants to remain peaceful. Police remained at the perimeter of the group but did not appear to be interacting with the protesters. 3:27 p.m. update: Thousands of demonstrators crowded Legislative Plaza Saturday afternoon, stretching up to the steps of the State Capitol. As speakers stepped up to a megaphone, the throngs cheered and chanted “I can’t breathe!” and “No justice, no peace!” Demonstrators packed together despite the ongoing threat of the coronavirus, wearing masks and lifting signs saying “Black Lives Matter” and “Not One More.” Police stood on the outskirts of the rally directing traffic. They didn’t interact with the demonstrators. Original story: Nashville Mayor John Cooper said he would attend a Saturday afternoon rally protesting police brutality and racism following the death of George Floyd. Cooper encouraged members of the city council to join him at the 3 p.m. rally at Legislative Plaza, which follows a wave of protests in other cities. The mayor said it was ""an especially critical time for all of us, as Metro’s leaders, to show up and listen to black voices speaking out from across Davidson County."" Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer kept a knee pressed into his neck for more than eight minutes. The officer, Derek Michael Chauvin, 44, was arrested and charged with murder. Floyd's death intensified anger and frustration for many who say it is an example of pervasive racism among law enforcement nationwide. Protests have swept through many major cities. Friday night protests in Memphis and Knoxville were peaceful, but violence has erupted during protests in Minneapolis, Louisville and Atlanta. Organizers of the Nashville rally said they wanted to create a peaceful and safe space for people to express their grief and call for change. Organizer Hamid Abdullah said Floyd's death had become a tipping point within the movement against racism and police brutality. ""More people are coming together. More people are listening. More people are paying attention,"" Abdullah said. ""People are fed up with brutality and they want to do something."" Abdullah said he welcomed ""all people of good will"" to the rally. He said he hoped Cooper would understand the need to make changes to prevent similar deaths in the future.

The ongoing debate over policing and racial bias has been a prominent part of life in Nashville for years. In 2018, local activists spurred a citywide vote that created the Community Oversight Board, a civilian panel that investigates allegations of police misconduct. The vote came after a white police officer shot Daniel Hambrick, 25, a black man, while he was running away during a foot pursuit. That officer, Andrew Delke, 26, was arrested and charged with murder. The case is pending. Reach Adam Tamburin at 615-726-5986 and atamburin@tennessean.com. Follow him on Twitter @tamburintweets.

Evening protest by Clarksville Indivisible Earlier Saturday, some 200 to 300 people gathered along Wilma Rudolph, protesting the death of Floyd in Minneapolis. Protester Kayla Cribbs, 25, said she wasn't surprised to see such a large crowd. ""People are tired"" of the violence against black people, she said, ""and it's not stopping."" ""It's got to stop eventually, and if that means we've got to riot, shout and cry and holler, that's what we've got to do. I'm just glad today it's peaceful,"" Cribbs said.

The demonstration was part of a National Day of Protest nationwide Saturday, a day after a Minneapolis police officer was arrested and charged with the third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death.

Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country convulsed through another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd’s death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. — In Indianapolis, police were investigating “multiple shootings” downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. — In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. — In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. — In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah’s governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. — In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. — And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city’s waterfront. “We don’t tolerate excessive use of force,” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Minneapolis’ streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to “quell this situation.” Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,” said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong.” Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. “Quite frankly I’m ready to just lock people up,” Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. “Yes, you caught us off balance once. It’s not going to happen twice.” This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would “have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and expressed sympathy for protesters’ concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV.",0.0

At least one person is dead after being shot in Indianapolis. Police are investigating whether the incident was connected to demonstrations in the city. In Los Angeles, protesters blocked the 110 freeway downtown and were seen breaking windows of stores at The Grove mall. Floyd, 46, died after being arrested in Minneapolis on Monday. A video shows a police officer kneeling on his neck for at least seven minutes while Floyd is heard saying he cannot breathe. That police officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers were present but have not been charged. All four were fired. Overnight curfews were enacted in cities nationwide — including Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Louisville, San Francisco and Denver — as authorities sought to stem any violence. The National Guard was also activated in several states, including Texas, Georgia, Washington, Ohio and Kentucky. In Minneapolis, authorities reported a ratcheting down of the previous night's unrest after an influx of National Guard troops and state troopers were dispatched to the city. ""Clearly we did not have the numbers in [Minneapolis police] alone,"" the city's mayor, Jacob Frey told Minnesota Public Radio early Sunday. ""Additional force was necessary."" Law enforcement began to make arrests in Minneapolis after an 8 p.m. curfew as crowds gathered at the 5th Precinct police building. Paul Schnell, the state corrections commissioner, said at a Saturday night press conference that an official count of arrests was not yet available but that authorities were ""committed to do whatever it takes to bring order."" Former Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden released a statement early Sunday morning condemning the violence and urging Americans to ""take care of each other."" ""Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response,"" he wrote. ""But burning down communities and needless destruction is not."" We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 Biden added, ""the act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest."" 1 person fatally shot in Indianapolis At least one person has died after being shot in downtown Indianapolis Saturday night. Police Chief Randal Taylor said at a press conference that authorities were still investigating the incident's connection to ongoing demonstrations in the city. ""Downtown is not safe at this time,"" Taylor said. He urged residents who do not live in the area to leave. Mayor Joe Hogsett called the day's protests ""successful"" in a tweet, but condemned the ""small group of people"" that grew violent later in the night. This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard.  Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop. — Mayor Joe Hogsett (@IndyMayorJoe) May 31, 2020 Police cruisers seen going through crowds in New York Several videos of protests in New York showed a police patrol vehicle driving through crowds of protesters. Protesters are seen surrounding and throwing debris at a car while another one drove into them. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the footage ""upsetting"" at a late night press conference Saturday but said it was ""inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers."" He addressed the city's peaceful protesters, saying they were heard but urging them to go home. ""We hear your desire to see these issues: relationship between police and community, the need for justice, the need for real change in our society,"" he said. ""We appreciate and respect all peaceful protests, but it is now time for people to go home."" California governor declares state of emergency in LA County Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti requested assistance to restore order Saturday night amid protests. A curfew began at 8 p.m. PT and is expected to end at 5:30 a.m. local time. The LAPD said hundreds of protesters were arrested amid the protests. An unlawful assembly was declared in the the Mid-Wilshire area and businesses were asked to close. Protesters blocked the 110 freeway in downtown LA and videos taken at protests showed looting and broken windows at stores in The Grove mall. Garcetti urged protesters to ""take a breath"" and ""step away"" at a press conference. He asked residents to go home and protest peacefully at a later time. We will always protect free speech and Angelenos’ right to live without fear of violence or vandalism.

Demonstrators flocked to the White House and nearby Lafayette Square throughout the afternoon where city and U.S. Park police and the Secret Service maintained barricades and pushed back against protesters, at times using pepper spray in an attempt to disperse crowds. Fireworks were set off and at least one car was set on fire. Buildings in downtown Washington had windows smashed — including the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute and an Apple store. A liquor store and a T-Mobile were also looted as tensions remained high through the early morning. The D.C. police union tweeted that one of its members had been hospitalized after being hit by a rock. We can confirm that at least one member has been hospitalized after being struck with a rock. — DC Police Union (@DCPoliceUnion) May 31, 2020 Earlier on Saturday, President Trump falsely accused the city's mayor, Muriel Bowser, of refusing to let D.C. police assist in containing Friday night's demonstrations. Bowser fired back at Trump at a Saturday press conference, saying the president's warning that ""ominous weapons"" and ""vicious dogs"" awaited any protester who made it past the White House fence was ""no subtle reminder"" of the country's history of segregationist violence. On Sunday morning, Bowser reiterated that sentiment on NBC's Meet The Press. ""I think the president has a responsibility to help calm the nation and he can start by not sending divisive tweets that are meant to harken to the segregationist past of our country and he can start by doing that right now,"" Bowser said.

The rally, protesting police brutality and racism, is scheduled to start at First Baptist Church Capitol and will reach Legislative Plaza and will take place from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. CDT. A march is scheduled to follow the rally. May 29 More than 24 cities continue to have protests. Now ex-officer Chauvin has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Vanderbilt posted the following statement regarding the incident: “The recent events in Minneapolis that led to the death of George Floyd have once again cast a spotlight on the challenges that African Americans and people of color face in this country. Mr. Floyd’s terrible, unnecessary and untimely death, as well as his treatment during his last seven minutes of life, again raises the existential question of whether some lives are more valued than others. Life is to be cherished and its protection falls on the shoulders of all of us, but even more importantly, on those given the authority to protect and defend our lives and laws. In all our roles as educators, scholars and stewards of the best ideas and values of a civil society, we must be part of the national chorus that cries out that all lives are valuable. Furthermore, as a community we should question why incidents such as these continue to occur, and what role we can play in creating a fairer and just world. At Vanderbilt, equity, diversity and inclusion are a major and treasured part of our ethos, and we do not tolerate racism, prejudice, hatred or violence in any form.” May 28 Protests continued in Minneapolis and eventually escalated to the burning of the Minneapolis Third Precinct police station. Other protests broke out in other cities including Denver, Colorado; Columbus, Ohio; Phoenix, Arizona and New York City, New York. May 27 Protests in Minneapolis escalated as Target and other local businesses were raided. May 26 The four officers involved in the incident were all fired by the Minneapolis Police Department. Thousands gathered to protest in Minneapolis. May 25 George Floyd, 46, was involved in an incident with four police officers on May 25, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Four police officers restrained a handcuffed Floyd with one officer, Derek Chauvin, placing his knee on Floyd’s neck. Eventually, Floyd was taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center and was pronounced dead 9:25 p.m. later that day. The video of the incident has since been widely shared across social media and may be disturbing to watch.",0.0

Thousands gathered at the gates of the complex in the early hours of the morning before the first call to prayer. There was a strong Israel security presence at the site, which is located on occupied Palestinian territory in the Old City. Police had been braced for potential unrest after Israeli security killed an unarmed Palestinian man on Saturday. Eyad Rawhi Al-Halaq, who had autism, did not stop when police asked to search him on suspicion he was carrying a gun. However, Jerusalem’s Old City was calm Sunday morning between the first call to prayer and the second one at midday. The faithful were able to access the religious complex individually or with family members. Aouni Bazbaz, the lead guide at the site, told Efe the Esplanade would remain open during its normal hours but that no more than 50 people are allowed to congregate inside the mosque at any given time. There are no restrictions on the number of people who can gather in the outside courtyard area, so long as they observe social distancing. Sheikh Omar al Kiswani, the director of Al Aqsa, praised the patience of the faithful during the months of waiting and urged them to scrupulously comply with the distancing measures “This is a mosque for all Muslims in the world,” he said. The spread of the pandemic saw the religious site closed for the longest time since the Crusades, Bazbaz told Efe. The extraordinary circumstances also mean that Ramadan and Eid were not celebrated in the mosque for the first time. EFE-EPA jma-aca/jt",0.0

1621509574,2020-05-30 15:33:42,National Guard summoned to  aid cities amid police clashes,https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/news/20200530/national-guard-summoned-to--aid-cities-amid-police-clashes?rssfeed=true,en,False,,106478,columbiadailyherald.com,http://columbiadailyherald.com/,"ATLANTA — Protesters burned businesses in Minneapolis. They smashed police cars and windows in Atlanta, broke into police headquarters in Portland, Oregon, and chanted curses at President Donald Trump outside the White House. Thousands also demonstrated peacefully, demanding justice for George Floyd, a black man who died after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck. As anger over Floyd’s killing spread to cities nationwide, local leaders increasingly said they could need help from National Guardsmen or even military police to contain the unrest. Georgia’s governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler also declared an emergency and ordered a nighttime curfew for the city. Another 500 Guard soldiers were mobilized in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died and an officer faced charges Friday in his death. But after another night of watching fires burn and businesses ransacked, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said early Saturday that he was moving to activate more than 1,000 more and was considering federal help. The Guard was also on standby in the District of Columbia, where a crowd grew outside the White House and chanted curses at President Donald Trump. Some protesters tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue, and threw bottles and other objects at officers wearing riot gear, who responded with pepper spray. “I just feel like he’s just one of many names that we’ve had to create hashtags and T-shirts and campaigns for and I feel like nothing has changed,” district resident Abe Neri said of Floyd. “And so that’s why I’m out here. Yeah, when you say nothing you’re taking the side of the oppressor.” Many protesters echoed that frustration, that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. The anger that seized the nation comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by a white father and son while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. In scenes both peaceful and violent across the nation, thousands of protesters chanted “No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” They hoisted signs reading: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp tweeted that up to 500 members of the Guard would deploy immediately “to protect people & property in Atlanta.” He said he acted at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who earlier appealed in vain for calm. Some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters in downtown Atlanta. At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said, as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at Del Frisco’s restaurant in the Buckhead neighborhood several miles north because of protesters there. “This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr.,” Bottoms said. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Bottoms was flanked by King’s daughter, Bernice King, and rappers T.I. and Killer Mike. “We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” said Killer Mike, crying as he spoke. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. In Portland, Oregon, protesters broke into police headquarters and authorities said they lit a fire inside. In Virginia’s capital, a police cruiser was set on fire outside Richmond police headquarters, and a city transit spokeswoman said a bus set ablaze was “a total loss,” news outlets reported. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, scrawled graffiti across its charred body and set it aflame again as officers retreated. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. The police department said numerous officers were injured. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Protesters in Houston, where Floyd grew up, included 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas: “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” Demonstrators on the West Coast blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland, California. About 1,000 protesters in Oakland smashed windows, sprayed buildings with “Kill Cops” graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police, who said several officers were injured by projectiles. One Los Angeles officer received medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and at least one city bus was vandalized. Police declared an unlawful assembly throughout downtown, where aerial footage from KTLA-TV showed scored of people corralled by police. San Jose, California, police said that Santa Clara County sheriff’s deputies shot at a fleeing SUV that was shown on video striking protesters, the San Jose Mercury News reported. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was hospitalized with a non-life-threatening injury, officials said. Liccardo said his city’s officers shared the community’s outrage over Floyd’s death. “It was a horrible injustice,” he told the AP. Portland, Oregon, police said at least one shooting was tied to the protest, although details weren’t immediately released. Two people were arrested during overnight riots in which protesters set fires throughout downtown and smashed storefront windows, police said, but arrest details were immediately available. Police, who declared the protest a riot, said they deployed gas after people threw projectiles at them. Mayor Wheeler tweeted a plea to protesters to remain peaceful and said that, while he had left the city to attend to his dying mother, he was heading back. He later declared a state of emergency. “Portland, this is not us,” he wrote. “How does this honor the legacy of George Floyd?”",0.0

Investigators are working to learn what materials were used in the fires. After the protest, which was slated for 3-5 p.m. Saturday, demonstrators marched through the city. As the evening progressed, some people spray painted vulgar language on buildings, toppled the statue of controversial lawmaker and newspaper publisher Edward Carmack at the state Capitol, and vandalized and stole from businesses on Broadway. The Metro Nashville Police Department said that at least 30 businesses were damaged, including several downtown bars. One person was charged with burglary.

People packed together despite the ongoing threat of the coronavirus, wearing masks and lifting signs reading “Black Lives Matter” and “Not One More.” Here's what we know: Sunday, May 31 8 p.m. curfew announced for Sunday Nashville police Chief Steve Anderson confirmed there will be a curfew Sunday night as the city continues to recover from a protest against police brutality that turned violent Saturday. Mayor John Cooper said the curfew would be in effect at 8 p.m. CT. Police will have a heightened presence downtown in an attempt to prevent another round of vandalism and destruction. Anderson said the details were still being discussed. He did not say when the curfew would start. Anderson said investigators had identified 20-30 people within the crowd who appeared to co-opt the peaceful rally and march ""as a cover for the destruction they wanted to deploy."" Police are still working to confirm their identities. Crews working to clean up courthouse Clean up crews were working to restore the courthouse which was damaged by protesters Saturday. In the wake of a crowd that had gathered around the historic courthouse Saturday night, fires were set, windows were smashed and a plaque dedicated to the Civil Rights Era was destroyed. Shattered glass littered the floors. Although workers had cleaned up a considerable amount Sunday, the damage was extensive. Even if rooms and furnishings weren't destroyed by protesters themselves, the sprinkler system drenched multiple rooms when the fire was set, extending the damage. Green Hills, CoolSprings, Opry Mills malls not opening The Green Hills and Opry Mills malls in Nashville and the CoolSprings Galleria in Franklin won't be opening Sunday after rumors swirled online of threats to loot the shopping centers. The decisions came after a night of protests across Nashville against police violence. ""Out of an abundance of caution, the Mall at Green Hills will remain closed today,"" the Mall at Green Hills said in a statement to The Tennessean. CoolSprings Galleria posted a statement on Twitter Sunday around 1:30 p.m. announcing the mall would be closed ""in light of current unrest and in an abundance of caution."" The Opry Mills Mall was inaccessible to visitors Sunday and had a security presence along with digital signs that said the property was closed. Saturday, May 30: Scheduled 'I Will Breathe' rally peaceful Saturday's ""I Will Breathe"" rally, scheduled from 3-5 p.m., proceeded largely without incident as thousands of demonstrators crowded Legislative Plaza. As speakers stepped up to a megaphone, the throngs cheered and chanted “I can’t breathe!” and “No justice, no peace!” Police stood on the outskirts of the rally directing traffic and didn’t interact with the demonstrators. About 4:40 p.m., protesters began marching downtown on Charlotte Avenue, with organizers urging participants to remain peaceful. Police remained at the perimeter of the group but did not appear to be interacting with the protesters. Police, protesters clash; fire set at Metro Courthouse Tensions ratcheted up as evening set in, and protesters started a fire at Nashville's Metro Courthouse, which also houses City Hall. Dozens of people had gathered on the steps of the building after the rally and march. Demonstrators smashed windows with rocks and other material, drawing a swarm of police. The situation appeared to subside by about 7:30 p.m. But by 8:15 p.m. fire was visible from the first floor. A short time later, police with riot gear arrived as a fire burned inside a window at City Hall. Officers deployed tear gas as rioters clustered in the center of Public Square Park. Elsewhere downtown, a statue outside the state Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who was a prohibitionist leader and espoused racist views, was torn down.

1621512589,2020-05-31 05:09:14,‘We’re sick of it’: Anger over police killings shatters US,https://www.wate.com/news/were-sick-of-it-anger-over-police-killings-shatters-us/,en,True,,84580,wate.com,http://www.wate.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Another night of unrest in every corner of the country left charred and shattered landscapes in dozens of American cities Sunday as years of festering frustrations over the mistreatment of African Americans at the hands of police boiled over in expressions of rage met with tear gas and rubber bullets. Cars and businesses were torched, the words “I can’t breathe” were spray-painted all over buildings, a fire in a trash bin burned near the gatesof the White House, and tens of thousands marched peacefully through city streets to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. His death is one of a litany of racial tragedies that have thrown the country into chaos amid the coronavirus pandemic that has left millions out of work and killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S., including disproportionate numbers of black people. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” People set fire to police cars, threw bottles at police officers and busted windows of storefronts, carrying away TVs and other items even as some protesters urged them to stop. In Indianapolis, police were investigating multiple shootings, including one that left a person dead amid the protests — adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphiawhen peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, mostly peaceful protests turned late Saturday and six officers hit with rocks and fireworks were injured. Police have arrested at least 1,669 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. The damage in U.S. cities came as many Americans plan to return to in-person church services on Sunday for the first time in several weeks since the pandemic forced a ban on large gatherings. Pastors in pulpits across the country will likely be urging peace amid the rubble of riots. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. But not all protests were marred by violence. In Juneau, Alaska,local police joined protesters at a rally in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city’s waterfront. “We don’t tolerate excessive use of force,” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told a gathering where most people wore masks and some sang Alaska Native songs. The show of force in Minneapolis came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. “l live here.

Barr said on Saturday Barr said that while it’s up to state and local leadership to halt the violence, the Department of Justice would support their efforts and take “all action necessary” to enforce federal law that prohibits crossing state lines to participate in or incite violent rioting. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) WASHINGTON (AP) — As protests over the death of George Floyd grow in cities across the U.S., government officials have been warning of the “outsiders” — groups of organized rioters they say are flooding into major cities not to call for justice but to cause destruction. But the state and federal officials have offered differing assessments of who the outsiders are. They’ve blamed left-wing extremists, far-right white nationalists and even suggested the involvement of drug cartels. These leaders have offered little evidence to back up those claims, and the chaos of the protests makes verifying identities and motives exceedingly difficult. Police officers across the country were gearing up Saturday for another night of potentially violent clashes in major cities. Some states had even called in the National Guard to aid overwhelmed police. The finger pointing on both sides of the political spectrum is likely to deepen the political divide in the U.S., allowing politicians to advance the theory that aligns with their political view and distract from the underlying frustrations that triggered the protests. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday told reporters he’d heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence and that even drug cartels “are trying to take advantage of the chaos.” John Harrington, the state’s commissioner of public safety, later said they had received intel reports on white supremacists. “But I cannot say that we have confirmed observations of local law enforcement to say that we’ve seen cells of white supremacists in the area,” he said Saturday. But federal officials later pointed to “far left extremist groups.” President Donald Trump alleged the violence was “being led by Antifa and other radical groups.” Antifa, short for anti-fascists, is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Attorney General William Barr later seemed to echo Trump’s assertion, saying the violent incidents in Minneapolis were driven by groups using “Antifa-like tactics.” Barr vowed that federal prosecutors across the country would use federal riots statutes to charge protesters who cross state lines to participate in violent rioting. A Justice Department spokesperson said the attorney general’s assertion was based on information provided from state and local law enforcement agencies, but did not detail what that information entailed. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was even more vague, declining to point to any particular ideology in his assessment. His agency has heard that “a number of different groups are involved in these whether it’s Antifa or it’s others, frankly,” he said. The groups appeared to be organized and using tactics that wouldn’t normally happen in peaceful protest, he said, though he didn’t elaborate. While the motives behind the violence were unclear, there was firmer evidence that some of the protesters were coming to the demonstrations from outside the urban centers that have been the epicenter of the demonstrations. In New York City, federal officials were bringing charges against several suspects, including one of two sisters from upstate New York accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail through the back window of a police van in Brooklyn, a law enforcement official said. The initially peaceful demonstrations in New York City over Floyd’s death spiraled into chaos as night fell Friday. Protesters confronted police officers, destroying police vehicles and setting fires. In Detroit, 37 of the 60 people who were arrested in overnight protests did not live in the city — and many came from nearby suburbs, police Chief James Craig said Saturday. Although Detroit is about 80% black, many of those arrested were white. “We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,” Craig told reporters. “If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community.” Initially, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said he’d been told all of those arrested in his city Friday were from outside the state. But a spokesman said Saturday night the mayor had later learned more than half are from Minnesota. In Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, 47 of the 57 people arrested in protest incidents through Saturday morning had provided a Minnesota address to authorities, according to Jeremy Zoss, a spokesman for the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office. Carter expressed the opinion of many black activists in the Twin Cities who have expressed disbelief that local residents would destroy their own neighborhoods, burning down essential services and damaging small businesses. And while it was local protesters and groups that staged initial angry, but peaceful, demonstrations, it was agitators from elsewhere that strategically escalated the tension by causing damage and setting fires, they said. Their beliefs were reinforced by the large numbers of white people in the protests in Minneapolis. “I think about a third of the people are from out of town here to make the city burn,” said Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage. “It is just putting black people in a crossfire not just between fascists and anarchists — but putting us in a crossfire with the national guard.” It’s exceedingly difficult in the chaos and dark of the events to prove these claims. The challenge is made harder in the Minnesota protest, where very few arrests were made in the first two nights of unrest. St. Paul arrest records showed 18 people were arrested on charges related to civil unrest from Thursday to early Saturday morning. Of those, only four were from outside the state; two were listed as unknown. Still, some civil rights leaders had a clear message for anyone coming to protest, even those who show up to call for justice for Floyd. “The moment has passed. Go home, stay away from here. We are a vulnerable population. At the end of that day if black folks can’t rebuild then the only thing we’ve done is build more power for white folks,” said Terrell. “You’re talking about years, decades of work undone by these groups — and by the officer.” Trump vowed Saturday that the “radical left criminals, thugs and others” would “not be allowed to set communities ablaze.” “I will not allow angry mobs to dominate,” he said. “Won’t happen.” ___ Hennessey reported from Minneapolis.

1621512579,2020-05-31 08:07:09,Massive US protests raise fears of new virus outbreaks,https://www.wate.com/news/national-world/massive-us-protests-raise-fears-of-new-virus-outbreaks/,en,True,,84580,wate.com,http://www.wate.com/#spider,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The mayor of Atlanta, one of dozens of U.S. cities hit by massive protests in recent days, has a message for demonstrators: “If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week.” As more beaches, churches, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, civil unrest in the United States over repeated racial injustice is raising fears of new coronavirus outbreaks in a country that has seen more infections and deaths than anywhere else in the world. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms warned that “there is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” Violent protests over the death of George Floyd have shaken the country from New York City to Minneapolis, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some protests have turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores burned and torched cars in the streets. City officials have ordered overnight curfews to quell the violence. Floyd, a black man, died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck. It was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in America. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks. “Whether they’re fired up or not, that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. The Minnesota health commissioner warned that the protests are almost certain to fuel new infections. “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. Even for the many protesters wearing masks, those don’t guarantee protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. On Sunday, many Americans were returning to in-person church services for the first time in many weeks as some emergency measures are lifted and mosques reopened across the Middle East, but in countries from India to Colombia the number of new infection was still on the rise. In Europe, unions in Paris flouted a ban on large gatherings Saturday to protest the dire conditions facing workers in the country illegally. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and said they had banned the march due to health risks. Hong Kong police have used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to break up protests in recent weeks. A ban on gatherings of more than eight people has been extended to June 4, the day of an annual candlelight vigil to mark the Chinese military’s 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. More than 6 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, tens of thousands of mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories that had been allowed to operate must close. The area has reported more nearly 2,500 infections and hospitals are reaching their limits. Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday, but without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. But England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation remained precarious. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 deaths in the pandemic, the second-highest number of confirmed virus deaths after the United States. “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment,” he said. “We have to get this right.” Pope Francis, meanwhile, cautioned against pessimism as people emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that “nothing will return as before.” That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that “the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.” ___ Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio.

KPD continues to report that shortly after the assembly, the window at Ruby Sunshine was vandalized and the group then dispersed all over downtown Knoxville. Officers were dispatched to the area in order to maintain public safety and prevent any further criminal activity. Just after midnight, a larger group assembled on the Clinch Avenue bridge and made its way towards downtown shooting fireworks, throwing trashcans into the road, smashing a port-a-potty and breaking glass somewhere near Clinch and Locust. Dakota Gifford Source: KPD Around 1 a.m., KPD observed a man, later identified as Dakota Gifford, exit a vehicle on the Market Square Garage. He was detained. Officers then searched the vehicle and found six handguns, two shotguns, two rifles and various narcotics. Gifford was charged with possession with intent to sell schedule I, possession with intent to sell schedule II, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony. Officers then gave out dispersal orders to a group of around 40 or more individuals that were making their way back towards Market Square. Dominic Brown Source: KPD KPD says the group then traveled north on Gay Street, where one person threw an object into a police SUV, hitting an officer in the head. The officer was uninjured. The 18-year-old male suspect, later identified as Dominic Brown, was then arrested and charged with assault, disorderly conduct, evading arrest, resisting arrest and inciting a riot. A KPD spokesperson says officers utilized pepper balls in response to increasing violence and vandalism. “The pepper balls were not used to impede on lawful assembly, but in a limited capacity to prevent further unlawful activity and uphold public safety. Additionally, the pepper balls were deployed only after two orders to disperse had been given,” said Scott Erland, KPD spokesperson. A second officer did sustain a minor injury during the arrest and was taken to a nearby Knoxville Fire Department station to receive first aid. No other injuries were reported. KPD reports that the groups had left the downtown area around 2 a.m. and officers are continuing to assess any additional vandalism’s that occurred overnight during this event.

The outside agitators responsible for this mayhem should cease, desist and leave our state. The police are not perfect. Those who transgress against our citizens should be brought to justice.” McNally continued to say that law enforcement is the only thing keeping order amid the chaos, and that he supported Gov. Lee’s decision to mobilize the National Guard and the THP Strike Force. “This lawlessness is counterproductive and wrong. It needs to end tonight.” Lt. Governor Randy McNally Representative Chuck Fleischmann says that his heart breaks after seeing initially peaceful protests turn violent. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann ”Protestors who are peacefully exercising their first amendment right should be allowed to be heard.‪ Chief Deputy Austin Garrett, Chief David Roddy, Chattanooga Police Department, Hamilton County Sheriffs Office have shown incredible leadership.‪ I also want to applaud the work of our local journalists who are continuing to work around the clock to ensure our community stays informed WRCB Channel 3 Eyewitness News, News 12 Now, WTVC-TV News, Channel 9 News, Chattanooga Times Free Press, Knoxville News Sentinel, WATE 6 On Your Side, WVLT, and WBIR Channel 10‪. It has been a rough year, and our nation will not heal overnight, but we should not forget how blessed we all are to live in the world’s strongest republic.‪ I know there are brighter days ahead if we remember that we are all united as one nation under God.” Rep. Chuck Fleischmann Representative Tim Burchett also released a statement regarding the violence in Nashville and nationwide. Tim Burchett. (Photo: WATE) “The killing of George Floyd was tragic, unnecessary and unacceptable. Communities of color, and in fact our entire nation, are right to be angry, and protesting peacefully and lawfully is an appropriate way to express that anger. Rioting, as we’ve seen across our country in recent days and in Nashville tonight is illegal and unworthy of being called a protest or a rally. Looting and damaging businesses, destroying private property, vandalizing and burning public buildings are acts that distract from the memory of George Floyd and the ongoing effort to eliminate racism in our country. Thankfully, in my hometown of Knoxville, protests yesterday were peaceful. Rather than uncontrolled opportunistic violence and looting, our country need to come together in unity and in prayer.” Rep. Tim Burchett At around 9:04 p.m. Saturday, Representative Jason Zachary took to Twitter, thanking law enforcement for the job they’re doing in Nashville. “Our @TNHighwayPatrol are risking their lives to protect our State Capitol from the criminals and vandals who are trashing Nashville. Please join me in praying for these men and women. I’m with them every week and they are true public servants.” Rep. Jason Zachary Our @TNHighwayPatrol are risking their lives to protect our State Capitol from the criminals and vandals who are trashing Nashville. Please join me in praying for these men and women. I’m with them every week and they are true public servants. pic.twitter.com/33WuHl5AhY — Rep. Jason Zachary (@JasonZacharyTN) May 31, 2020 University of Tennessee Athletics releases ‘unified statement’ The University of Tennessee Athletic Director Phillip Fulmer, along with 15 of the university’s head coaches released a unified statement: “We hold our student-athletes to very high standards. With rare exceptions, our young men and women meet those standards and represent themselves, their families, their teams and the University of Tennessee with excellence—academically, athletically and socially. Right now, our student-athletes are hurting. They navigate an emotional road of sadness, confusion and rage. Our black student-athletes carry the added burden of fear and hopelessness—an old wound torn open again by the horrifying, auto-repeat playlist of viral violence in our country that seemingly will not cease. As Tennessee head coaches, we are now calling on anyone who is a fan of the Vols and Lady Vols to meet and expect a standard in our daily walk. Let us all refuse to accept or tolerate the unjust treatment of our black neighbors. Let us challenge those who attempt to justify, dismiss, ignore or explain away mistreatment of blacks or any other person of color. Let us meet this standard head-on, out loud and outside our homes. Demand action that leads to change. Demand PROGRESS. This is a basic, human principle that, among some, seems to have become as endangered as basic human rights for blacks in our communities. Society could benefit by injecting into our communities an element of the “team” mindset that exists in a sport locker room. It’s widely accepted that sport teaches valuable lessons about leadership, discipline, collaboration, dependability and perseverance. However, the most IMPACTFUL and life-changing lesson sport teaches might actually be the lesser-touted ability to fully accept and embrace people who are different from us and have very different life experiences. On healthy teams, if you wear the same jersey as me, I’ve got your back—regardless of race or ethnicity, it doesn’t matter. Let’s go work together and win. Period. Wherever you’re reading this, it likely holds true that the cultures that exist in the sports programs at your local high school or college are much healthier than the culture in your local community. Why do these healthy cultures exist in small sports teams’ locker rooms all across the country, but not in our larger communities? What can we study within a healthy team dynamic that can be applied to a metropolitan city or a rural farm town? As coaches, we don’t have all the answers to fix what’s been broken for so long. But if total acceptance, understanding and empathy—regardless of human differences—can coexist on sports teams, those things should be able to coexist anywhere. Vol Nation, let’s rise to the challenge to meet a new standard. If you’re going to support our black student-athletes when they compete, please have the courage to support them and their families in their daily pursuit of peace, happiness and equity.” Phillip Fulmer , Director of Athletics Beth Alford-Sullivan , Track & Field/Cross Country Rick Barnes , Men’s Basketball Lisa Glenn , Rowing Kellie Harper , Women’s Basketball Matt Kredich , Swimming & Diving Alison Ojeda , Women’s Tennis Judi Pavon , Women’s Golf Brian Pensky , Soccer Jeremy Pruitt , Football Eve Rackham , Volleyball Tony Vitello , Baseball Brennan Webb , Men’s Golf Karen Weekly , Softball Ralph Weekly , Softball Chris Woodruff , Men’s Tennis LATEST STORIES:",0.0

Hugo looked into his Sbarro Pizza on the corner of Second Avenue and Commerce Street. The corridor was one of the hardest hit by vandals after a peaceful demonstration in response to the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after being pinned down by a white Minneapolis police officer. A march following the ""I Will Breathe"" rally to protest police brutality in Nashville turned destructive Saturday evening. Businesses, government buildings and a police cruiser were damaged. Crews put up boards over broken windows at Sbarro Pizza in downtown Nashville on Sunday, May 31, 2020. (Photo: Shelley Mays / The Tennessean) ""We saw it happening on the news, and thought, 'no — please no,'"" said Hugo, who owns the restaurant. ""I don't know why they are doing this. It turned violent, and all it takes is a spark."" Britton walked away from Hugo to let him clean up the location, where televisions were destroyed and windows were smashed. Someone had attempted to steal the cash register. Britton moved to Nashville 16 months ago and became friends with the pizza shop owners. On Saturday night, he and other tenants stood in front of their apartment building in hopes of impeding any vandalism to their homes. ""They were friendly toward people, but not toward businesses,"" he said. ""They had sledgehammers. They had evil in their eyes. But this isn't about me. It's about the business owners who are dealing with this today.""

Clouds of tear gas mushroomed across Public Square Park. Windows shattered, and spray paint tagged the walls. As conflict and destruction erupted in the aftermath of a peaceful protest in Nashville on Saturday, it left a mark on a city already scarred. The decimation of deadly tornadoes. The forced isolation of a pandemic. A peaceful rise against injustice overtaken by vandals. Nashville has endured the unimaginable this year. On Saturday afternoon, protesters streamed through Nashville's streets toward the courthouse as part of the ""I Will Breathe"" rally to decry police brutality and the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and other black men and women across the country. The scene of Nashville's protest reflected images of 60 years ago, when thousands marched silently to the courthouse steps as part of Nashville's sit-in movement. That nonviolent uprising led to the integration of Nashville's lunch counters, a historic moment in the city's history. This time, near dusk on Saturday, tensions flared. At least 30 Nashville businesses were damaged. The Metro Nashville Police Department arrested 28 people during the protests or after the 10 p.m. curfew. Eleven of those people were white, 16 black and one Hispanic. Seven of the arrestswere made after midnight on Broadway downtown. Early Sunday morning, the scream of security alarms stillechoed on empty downtown streets, highlighting the trauma. The name George Floyd emblazoned the wall of Bridgestone Arena, written in yellow spray paint. Windows lay in shards at the historic Ryman Auditorium and dozens of stores and famous honky tonks along the city's tourism corridor. The cash register terminal and sound equipment were smashed at The Stage, where the staff had fortified in a back office for protection. The smoldering flames singed the air from a fire at Boot Barn a few doors down. At the courthouse, graffiti marked the building's limestone facade. The letters BLM, for Black Lives Matter, tagged the towering doors. The words ""sleep now in fire"" marred a corner of the building. On the entry columns, the phrase ""F--- 12"" was scrawled in black spray paint, a slang term used repeatedly during ongoing protests and riots. The ""12"" standing for L, the 12th letter in the alphabet, and for the word ""law."" And the granite plaque commemorating Diane Nash, a civil rights leader in Nashville, was broken to pieces — its fragments used to shatter windows. Nashville Fire Department investigators worked to determine who started the multiple fires downtown. Nashville police arrested a 25-year-old man on felony arson and vandalism charges Sunday night. An 8 p.m. curfew was put in place after Mayor John Cooper, declared a state of emergency. The order came, even as more rallies, including one in Murfreesboro on Sunday, prepared to begin. “It is our firm belief that those individuals defacing and destroying public property after the rally were not a part of the original event,"" The Equity Alliance co-founders and co-Executive Directors Charlane Oliver and Tequila Johnson said in a statement. ""The actions by this small group reflect neither the beliefs of the groups that led today's peaceful assembly nor those of the majority of the attendees. This behavior dishonors the memory of George Floyd and other black Americans that have died unjustly at the hands of police. “The Equity Alliance condemns and disavows tonight’s violent rioting. We urge anyone feeling heartfelt, honest anger over the murder of George Floyd to direct that energy toward November’s election. The only true way to change our nation for the better is by taking up our civic duty as Americans and making it clear with our vote that we reject racism in all its forms.” A critical time to speak 'against senseless killing' Before Nashville's rally, many in the city stood together. Earlier in the week, Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson, filled with disdain and ""emotionally shaken,"" condemned the police behavior in Minneapolis. Cooper urged his fellow city leaders in the Metro Council to join him at the ""I Will Breathe"" rally. ""This is an especially critical time for all of us, as Metro’s leaders, to show up and listen to Black voices speaking out from across Davidson County,"" he said, ""as they speak out against the senseless killing of George Floyd and the deep-seated issues of racial injustice in our country."" Thousands gathered without incident on a crowded Legislative Plaza at 3 p.m. Saturday. As speakers stepped up to a megaphone, the throngs cheered and chanted ""I can’t breathe!"" and ""No justice, no peace!"" Police stood on the outskirts of the rally directing traffic and didn’t interact with the demonstrators. About 4:40 p.m., protesters began marching downtown on Charlotte Avenue, with organizers urging participants to remain peaceful. Problems then began to emerge. A little more than a mile from the Capitol, several people were arrested when windows were smashed in a Metro Nashville police cruiser near Sixth Avenue South and Korean Veterans Boulevard. Some protesters later threw rocks and bottles at officers. Tensions ratcheted up as evening set in, and protesters started a fire at the Metro Nashville Courthouse. A short time later, police with riot gear arrived as flames licked the inside of City Hall. Officers deployed tear gas at people clustered in the center of Public Square Park. Nashville police issued a 10 p.m. curfew in the city on Saturday night. Cooper declared a state of civil emergency, and Gov. Bill Lee deployed the National Guard. ""The threat to both peace and property is unacceptable and we will work with local law enforcement and community leaders to restore safety and order. This is not a reflection of our state or the fundamental American right to peaceful protest,"" Lee wrote on Twitter. Citizens come together to clean up: 'That's not who we are' Early Sunday, police stood in front of a chain-link fence outside of the Metro Nashville Courthouse to allow a city crew to clean up. Store owners assessed what had been broken or stolen — mobile phones, tourist trinkets, boots, a drum kit and more. Butch Spyridon, president of Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp., said it was too early to assess the extend of the damage, but he estimated it could be hundreds of thousands of dollars based on what he watched unfold on television ""I'm without question at a loss for words, stunned by what I saw, and sad for Nashville,"" he said, ""because that's not who we are."" In the aftermath, the city's spirit emerged. Before daybreak, a construction worker boarded up windows without being asked. City preachers spoke about the rally and about violence against black people. The Rev. John Faison Sr. wrapped up Watson Grove Missionary Baptist Church’s morning worship service with a discussion about the purpose of protests. He was joined by local activist Justin Jones and Metro Councilperson Delishia Porterfield. ""It’s designed to create tension,"" Jones said. ""A protest with permission is a parade. A protest is not meant to be comfortable."" The words echoed even as Nashville citizens and law enforcement came together with spray bottles and rags, volunteering to remove the graffiti on the side of Bridgestone Arena downtown.

(Photo: Shelley Mays / The Tennessean) ""I think my emotions are the same as everyone who loves the city,"" said Sean Henry, president and CEO of the Predators. ""You understand the anger and passions that are out there, because far too often we see examples of extreme racism boiling up. ""In this case, a peaceful protest turned to violence, and we understand that underlying anger is there. There are many emotions involved — rightful emotions by the way — and we hope be part of the conversation to bring people together short term and long term. ""We have this wonderful history of coming through things differently than other cities,"" Henry added. ""And we do it together. I think that spirit will come through again.""

Bill Lee said Sunday he is increasing a deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to help with law enforcement, this time in all three divisions of the state. The governor made the announcement one day after 75 guardsmen were deployed in Nashville in response to an eruption of violence. The rancor occurred after a peaceful rally attended by thousands of Tennesseans who were protesting police brutality and racism. The governor did not say how many and exactly where the guardsmen will be deployed Sunday. Additionally, Lee announced a joint effort between the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement to investigate Saturday's violence in Nashville, which he said was provoked by many non-Tennesseans. “The right to peaceful protest is foundational to our country, but the violence and vandalism that occurred in Nashville last night was unlawful and tears at the fabric of our community,” Lee said in a statement. “We have reason to believe that many of those involved in unlawful acts are not Tennesseans and we will be working with law enforcement to investigate this further and bring those responsible to justice.” The violence occurred hours after thousands of people gathered near the Capitol for a peaceful rally, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Organizers of Saturday's rally urged participants to remain peaceful but violence later erupted throughout the city's downtown area, including windows being smashed and a fire being set at the city's historic Metro Courthouse, which includes city hall offices. In total, 28 Metro Nashville police arrested 28 people Saturday night, many after the 10 p.m. curfew. Of those, 21 are from Nashville, four from elsewhere in Tennessee and three from out of state: Texas, Illinois and New York. Saturday's deployment of the National Guard, which was aimed at providing assistance to the Tennessee Highway Patrol and Metro Police Department, was likely the first such move for law enforcement purposes in decades. The guardsmen first reported to the Capitol grounds, where a statue was toppled over. The troops later moved to Lower Broadway, to provide assistance after businesses were damaged.

Roberson said there are no estimates of the total cost of the various damage to state-owned properties.

The governor made the announcement shortly after 9 p.m. Lee signed an executive order, effectively affirming a 10 p.m. curfew Cooper implemented. ""I mobilized the National Guard to assist in protecting the lives and property of Tennesseans, which is a critical responsibility of government,"" the governor's executive order stated. The governor signed another executive order on Sunday to once again coincide with Nashville's latest curfew, which is set for 8 p.m. Tennessee's last major deployment of its National Guard for law enforcement purposes occurred in 1968, after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As many as 4,000 guardsmen were deployed in Nashville the day King was murdered, according to The Tennessean's archives. Troops were stationed throughout the city, including standing guard, complete with rifles and bayonets, outside the state Capitol. The National Guard was deployed throughout Nashville for several days after King's assassination. Guardsmen were also deployed in Memphis.

The words of a Bible verse, carved on a plaque hung outside the Nashville courthouse to commemorate the civil rights movement in Nashville, were smashed to pieces Saturday and replaced with spray painted profanities. The windows of city hall were smashed using the granite pieces, giving people access to start multiple fires inside and outside the very same civic plaza where 60 years ago thousands marched to end segregation. Mayor John Cooper closely watched events unfold Saturday night, following the ""I Will Breathe"" rally he attended earlier in the day organized to decry police brutality and the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and other black men and women in Nashville and across the country. When a standoff between police, protesters and others turned tense, Cooper said he knew further action was needed. Coordinating with Gov. Bill Lee, Cooper a few hours later declared a state of emergency in the city, imposed a curfew and requested Lee bring in the Tennessee National Guard. But when hundreds of phones buzzed on the Public Square Park lawn, notifying those outside they will be arrested if they violate the 10 p.m. curfew, the emergency alerts went largely ignored as some lobbed water bottles and rocks at police, who, wearing riot gear, returned tear gas and flash bangs. By the end of the night, at least 30 Nashville businesses were damaged as crowds moved to Lower Broadway. The Metro Nashville Police Department arrested 28 people. City leaders and the public watching the mayhem play out in images and videos condemned certain actions. ""A healing event evolved into simple hooliganism,"" Cooper said as he sat in the mayor's office Sunday morning after walking through the damage at what is now being investigated as an arson site. ""(Metro Courthouse) has been the scene of social justice improvement,"" he said. ""Ironic is too small of a word to use here."" An 8 p.m. curfew was in place Sunday and will be considered on a day-to day-basis going forward, he said, along with his executive order as other cities have seen repeated days of protests. The National Guard will continue to assist as needed. Rally organizers: Concerns shouldn't be overshadowed While organizers of the rally have said the events that happened after the rally were not a part of their efforts, they say the frustrations expressed Saturday should not be overshadowed by the actions of a few. ""I'm irritated about how the narrative is changing to how people are protesting to what the real problem is,"" said Odessa Kelly, executive director of Stand Up Nashville. ""Rioting is the language of people who feel their voices are never heard. I'm tired of hearing peaceful protests. Do we want that to happen? Yes. But the crux of that is that we have a messed up system here. The police system needs to be fixed to not allow these atrocities to happen,"" Kelly said. Attention from city leaders, she said, has moved to condemnation rather than how they can use their position and platforms to address the issues the black community has talked about for decades. Nashville Mayor John Cooper moves through the crowd gathered Saturday, May 30, 2020, for the “I Will Breathe” rally to protest the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after being pinned down by a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day. (Photo: Larry McCormack/ The Tennessean) The Equity Alliance had to release a statement Saturday night when protesting turned violent that they were not associated with the events outside the courthouse. “It was frustrating to come out and say we didn’t do it because we don’t want people to feel like they can’t express themselves; that their anger or frustration is unheard or we are particularly condemning their frustration or anger,” said Tequila Johnson, co-executive director of The Equity Alliance. “At the same time, we have to be diligent and say there were bad apples with the intention of destroying property. We don’t stand by that, we don’t encourage that,” she said. Protests ripple across nation Protests have rippled across the country after the deaths this month of Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, and Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman, in Louisville. Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer kept a knee pressed into his neck for more than eight minutes. Taylor, an aspiring nurse, was killed in her apartment, shot at least eight times by Louisville police officers who officials have said were executing a warrant. The ongoing debate over policing and racial bias has been prominent in Nashville for years. In 2018, white police officer Andrew Delke shot Daniel Hambrick, 25, a black man, while he was running away during a foot pursuit. Before that, white police officer Josh Lippert shot and killed Jocques Clemmons after a traffic stop, foot chase and confrontation in the James A. Cayce Homes. Protesters gather in Nashville, Tenn., Saturday, May 30, 2020 for the “I Will Breathe” rally to protest the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after being pinned down by a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day. (Photo: Larry McCormack/ The Tennessean) Debate has raged on about who was out in downtown Nashville on Saturday night and with what agenda, just as in other cities across the country. Police said they are trying to identify individuals who hijacked a peaceful protest against racism and used it “as a cover for the destruction they wanted to employ.” Many seen leading vandalism outside the police central precinct and city hall were white, with several instances of black protesters trying to stop them from inciting violence. Still, many local residents were out protesting and expressing their frustrations, though they were perhaps not a part of Nashville's established social justice groups. But it has prompted questions from those who asked why one would wreck their own community. The answer is complicated, especially for marginalized groups that say they have been squeezed out during Nashville's recent boom years. ""To me, the courthouse being burnt out is less about the actual thing but a personification of what has happened to black people on a larger scale,"" Johnson said. ""When you saw that courthouse burning, it was a reflection of what a lot of people here are feeling right now. They feel the burn inside from mistreatment, marginalization, from oppression.""

""Any time we rebuild or vitalize the city, it's done off the backs of black people who are being pushed out of the city."" Beyond policing, there are compounding issues including lack of affordable housing, cost burden and further stigma. ""All that goes into what happened last night,"" Kelly said. ""People burning down property is not good but that can be restored. People's lives cannot be restored. So when we equate to two in the same breath, that's where I'm irritated and looking for our leadership to step up."" Cooper: 'We want to adjust' “Of course we want to adjust,"" Cooper said Sunday, when asked how his administration plans to address the calls for changes. ""You have to acknowledge the failures of keeping the full American promise to everybody for equal justice under law. It's a constant challenge and something we have struggled with."" The reality as a result of the past few months with COVID-19 and the March tornado, he said, has meant his office hasn't been a platform for much change, instead, one of ""healing and delivering services."" Metro Council's Minority Caucus penned a letter to Cooper on Saturday, telling him that listening to the concerns of the black community will not suffice and that action is necessary. The city, wrote at-large council member and caucus chair Sharon Hurt, must call for support of the oversight board and accountability of police. Cooper must also fund body cameras, send a fair share of CARES Act relief for COVID-19 directly to the black community and also ensure more economic equity in Metro contracts with black businesses. The city, Hurt said, also needs a chief diversity officer in the administration. ""We want to address that,"" Cooper said, about the calls to action heard Saturday during the rally. Chants broke out Saturday to defund police and for Anderson to resign.

(Photo: Larry McCormack/ The Tennessean) Cooper pointed out the ""quality policing"" seen Saturday night and said the city should also get credit for other areas it has been effective in, including the agreement between Metro police and the Community Oversight Board. The city, he said, will have a full body camera program when it's past its ""crisis budget."" But advocates and members of the Community Oversight Board have been critical of police Chief Steve Anderson and the police department for failing to cooperate with the civilian panel and the very idea that an agreement is necessary to get one Metro department to work with another. Asked if he supported Anderson, Cooper said what played out Saturday on live television showed the actions of the police department working well in a very difficult moment. ""He is the chief. And I think deservingly should take some credit,"" Cooper said. Cooper ended a interview before he could respond to a question asked about Metro police's relationship with the oversight board. Jamel Campbell-Gooch, deputy director of Gideon's Army and the vice chair of the oversight board, said the time has come for not asking but demanding changes. Residents can push to make sure the oversight board has access to information from the police department, call for the city to get rid of bad officers and push for changes to the budget to make changes to public safety on the front end, Campbell-Gooch said. “There are things we can be reaching for locally right now,” he said. “It’s time. All the changes they want to see need to be invested by the mayor’s office to actually stop violence.” Read or Share this story: https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2020/05/31/nashville-mayor-john-cooper-curfew-sunday-night/5299774002/",0.0

The violence ensued afterward and it was an attempt to set back civil rights progress in Nashville. Story Highlights David Plazas is the director of opinion and engagement for the USA TODAY Network Tennessee. Nashville wanted and deserved a peaceful protest on Saturday. The afternoon rally at Tennessee’s Legislative Plaza in downtown Nashville was peaceful and an amazing example of civic engagement and good citizenship. The violence that ensued after it finished, perpetrated by troublemakers separate from rally organizers, was atrocious and an affront to basic decency. The Old Courthouse that houses city hall was set on fire. A plaque commemorating the protests of 1960 that ended the desegregation of lunch counters was destroyed. Downtown businesses were vandalized and looted. The bad actors, whoever they are, wanted to stain Nashville, delegitimize the rally, sow distrust among citizens and set our civil rights progress way behind. It is important to decouple the two events. CLOSE Protesters set fire outside a window at Nashville's Metropolitan Courthouse Saturday, May 30, 2020 Nashville Tennessean Nashville's civil rights history is complicated In the first, more than a thousand people of diverse races and backgrounds gathered to denounce police brutality, demand justice for African Americans and communities of color, and call for transformational systemic change that has disproportionately kept marginalized people from benefiting from America’s promise. The afternoon rally was inspired by the brutal and unjustified killing of George Floyd, an African American man, by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25. Derek Chauvin was fired from the police force and is now charged with Floyd’s murder.

(Photo: Larry McCormack/ The Tennessean) Nashville has a complicated legacy when it comes to civil rights. The student sit-in movement was birthed, nurtured and sustained in Music City. But the remnants of segregation persist in housing patterns and displacement and in inequitable access to health care, education and job opportunities. African Americans and communities of color are disproportionately incarcerated at a higher rate than white citizens. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed the problem; African Americans are getting sicker and dying at a disproportionately higher rate than their white peers. In addition, Metro Nashville Police Department’s handling of the killings of two black men — Jocques Clemmons in 2017 and Daniel Hambrick in 2018 — at the hands of white police officers has been highly criticized. So much so, that 60% of Nashville voters approved a community oversight board of police in November 2018. The African American community’s call for such a board had been made for at least 40 years. To his credit, Metro Nashville Police Department Chief Steve Anderson — who has long been a target of community criticism for over policing minority communities — condemned Floyd’s killing. Blame the perpetrators of violence for the mayhem Metro Nashville-Davidson County Mayor John Cooper invited the Metro Council and the community to join him at Saturday’s peaceful rally. It was a call for unity, peace and collaboration at a fraught time in our nation and contrasted the divisive, toxic and violent rhetoric of other leaders. On his social media posts, Cooper has faced criticism from people blaming him for the violence. But he is not to blame. The people who committed the atrocious acts are, and they should be held accountable for their misdeeds. Nashville is in a state of stress and healing in the aftermath of the March 3 tornadoes, COVID-19, the economic fallout from the pandemic and now Saturday night’s violence. However, it is incumbent upon our leaders and fellow citizens to continue to do the work, despite the setbacks, struggles and frustration, to move Nashville toward a place where equity and inclusion are not just talked about but are achieved by all in the community. We cannot be deterred. We will not be deterred.

1621701036,2020-05-31 12:48:01,Woman charged with rioting in downtown Memphis,https://wreg.com/news/woman-charged-with-rioting-in-downtown-memphis/,en,False,,78089,wreg.com,http://www.wreg.com/#spider,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Multiple people are facing charges after a second demonstration in downtown Memphis on Saturday night. According to a Facebook post from the Memphis Police Department, this began around 11:33 p.m. while police were trying to disperse a crowd in the area of Beale Street and Main Street. Officers gave an order for the crowd to disperse and several people got mad and allegedly jumped on top of squad cars. Additional officers were called in and bike racks were used to help contain the crowd. MPD says the crowds began to push through the bike racks and officers, causing the racks to fall over. The two individuals and officers holding down the bike racks fell to the ground. Officers also say they saw several people throwing bottles into the crowd from a rooftop in the area of B.B. King and Beale Street. According to police, people were throwing fireworks at them and rocks were thrown at businesses and squad cars for several hours. People were driving erratically and MPD received multiple shots-fired calls. Around 2:30 a.m., a person driving near Beale Street and Fourth allegedly fired shots at an officer. The officer was not hit but the suspect was taken into custody. Another person shot at an officer an hour later but the alleged suspect fled the scene and has not been taken into custody. Memphis Police Department Director Michael Rallings released a statement on Facebook surrounding the fact police were wearing riot gear: “Some have asked why our officers were wearing riot gear protection. I feel that this question is asked because some do not know all of the details. Clearly, you can see that our officers were wearing riot gear protection to protect themselves and so that they can protect our citizens. I have said that we support peaceful protest, but we will not stand by and let the few that want to wreak havoc tear down our city. The peaceful protest that took place earlier in the day was powerful and had meaning. The riot that occurred later in the downtown area only brought chaos and civil unrest. My hat goes off to those who seek justice through peaceful protest; they have meaning, heart, and purpose.” Michael Rallings, Dir. of Memphis Police Department Local Activist Hunter Demster witnessed the events from Saturday night and says there is far more to the story. “I don’t understand how they can’t grasp that to form that line of riot cops brandishing their billy clubs, paramilitary assault uniforms, AR-15s, how that is not going to escalate the situation,” Demster said. Multiple people were taken into custody and are facing weapon charges, obstruction of roadways, rioting and evading arrest. Activists say that many of the people arrested Saturday were not a part of the protest and took issue with the arrests. Victoria Jones, Geno McGary, Damion Smith, Kameron Miller, Likisha Davis and Rodney White have since been released on their own recognizance.",0.0
1621723906,2020-05-31 15:15:00,Target Says It Will Temporarily Close Stores In Several States As Protests Continue,https://www.wmot.org/post/target-says-it-will-temporarily-close-stores-several-states-protests-continue,en,False,,310386,wmot.org,http://wmot.org/,"Amid continuing protests over the death of George Floyd, Target has temporarily closed or adjusted hours at more than 200 stores nationwide. The announcement on Saturday from the nation's eighth largest retailer came after Target stores in multiple cities became scenes of violence and unrest. Among the stores where aisles were ransacked was a Target in Minneapolis located near the city's 3rd police precinct, where the four officers who were fired after Floyd's death worked. The station was damaged by a fire last week. ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,"" the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. ""At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores."" A Target spokesperson said that the company is evaluating closures and limiting hours on a store-by-store basis. The majority of stores being closed are located in Minnesota, and in California, where protests in Los Angeles led the National Guard to be deployed. Stores will also close in Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Despite the violence that has hit its stores, the company has voiced support for demonstrators. ""The murder of George Floyd has unleashed the pent-up pain of years, as have the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote in a public letter on Friday. ""We say their names and hold a too-long list of others in our hearts."" It remains unclear whether the looting at Target stores was committed by demonstrators or whether they were the actions of unaffiliated bad actors. But the ongoing demonstrations have focused scrutiny on Target's past work with law enforcement — including partnerships with agencies in at least 2o cities. In Minneapolis, the company partnered with police on a program that helped install closed-circuit television cameras in the downtown area. A 2010 report released with support from the company said the ""genesis of the program was a widespread feeling some years ago in the city of Minneapolis that the downtown business district was not a pleasant place to work or visit.""

The president has said that members of the loosely defined far-left group Antifa — short for ""anti-fascists"" — have led clashes with police and looting in cities across the country since the killing of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis. It's unclear if any group or groups are primarily responsible for escalating protests that began following George Floyd's death on May 25 as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has told the press he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence. In one tweet Sunday, Trump said the United States ""will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" It's something he's previously floated, and last year two Republican senators introduced a resolution that sought to designate the group as a domestic terrorist organization. Following Trump's tweet, Attorney General William Barr said in a statement that ""[f]ederal law enforcement actions will be directed at apprehending and charging the violent radical agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest."" Barr added: ""The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly."" The clashes, spreading to dozens of cities across the U.S., follow a series of racist incidents and deaths of black people, including Floyd's on Monday. Chauvin, now a former Minneapolis police officer, was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck while holding him in custody, as Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers present at the scene have been fired, but not arrested or charged. Protests and clashes that have since followed come at a time of unprecedented crisis for the country, with confirmed deaths from the coronavirus pandemic topping 100,000 and millions out of work as a result of broad business shutdowns. Minorities, including African Americans, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 deaths and pandemic-induced economic peril. ""The death of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis was a grave tragedy. It should never have happened. It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger, and grief."" pic.twitter.com/lirAMSv4Wo — The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 30, 2020 Trump addressed the demonstrations Saturday, striking a milder tone during prepared remarks following a manned space launch in Florida than he has on Twitter. He said Floyd's death ""has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger and grief."" He added that he ""understands the pain that people are feeling"" and supports peaceful protest, but that ""the memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists."" ""He should just sometimes stop talking"" Apart from Saturday's remarks, though, Trump has not often played a unifying role in recent days. His tweets about radical-left anarchists have also included criticism of Democratic leadership in Minnesota. In another tweet on Sunday he blamed the mainstream media for fomenting ""hatred and anarchy."" Time for a change! #2020 https://t.co/AECy2GBfys — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020 On Friday, Trump tweeted provocatively that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase with a racist history that Trump said he was not aware of. Later on, he said his intent was not to make a threat, but to register a statement of concern that armed violence can accompany looting. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, said on Fox News Sunday that the president's tweets about demonstrations turning violent are ""not constructive."" Speaking on ABC's This Week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Sunday morning that she's not paying attention to Trump's inflammatory tweets. Instead, she said he ""should be a unifying force in our country. We have seen that with Democratic and Republican presidents all along. They have seen their responsibility to be the president of the United States, to unify our country, and not to fuel the flame."" Also Sunday, Keisha Lance Bottoms — mayor of Atlanta, one city that's seen protests and clashes with police — told CBS' Face The Nation that Trump's tweets are ""making it worse"" and ""he should just sometimes stop talking."" In his own statement Saturday, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, wrote that ""protesting [Floyd's killing] is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not."" He added that as president, he'd lead the conversation about turning the nation's ""anguish to purpose."" ",0.0
1621723969,2020-05-31 15:30:59,President Trump wants to declare antifa a terrorist group. Here's what we know about their Tennessee activities.,http://rssfeeds.tennessean.com/~/625702726/0/nashville/home~President-Trump-wants-to-declare-antifa-a-terrorist-group-Heres-what-we-know-about-their-Tennessee-activities/,en,False,,73100,blogs.tennessean.com,http://blogs.tennessean.com/#spider,"President Donald Trump has announced he intends to designate a militant anti-racist movement a terrorist organization as violent protests attended by a variety of activists have erupted in cities around the country, including Nashville. The protests, some of which have resulted in destruction of property and violent clashes with police, are being held in response to police killing George Floyd in Minneapolis and other black individuals who have recently died at the hands of law enforcement. ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,"" Trump said during remarks at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday, though it's unclear by what legal mechanism he can designate a domestic organization to be a terrorist group. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a left-wing activist movement active globally, including in Tennessee. The loosely affiliated groups frequently advocate for anti-racist policies, though often take an anarchist and militant approach. There is no formal leadership or unified national structure to the movement. It is not one organization, but rather loose network of activists using a ""black bloc"" tactic at protests — dressing in all black and concealing their faces with masks and bandannas. Multiple antifa groups have been based in Nashville in recent years. No clear evidence antifa organized violent protests in Nashville While many of the protesters in Nashville on Saturday fit that description, it's unclear if any affiliate with antifa organizations. Metro Nashville Police Department Chief Steve Anderson said Sunday the city is investigating a small group of people they believe used the protest as a cover for violence and other criminal acts. The police chief did not say if any organized groups might be behind the violence in Nashville. A peaceful rally held downtown Saturday afternoon evolved throughout the evening, eventually turning from a march into a chaotic eruption of vandalism to public and private property. Metro Nashville's historic courthouse and city hall were set afire in the process, among other significant damage the building sustained. Antifa groups have, however, openly mobilized overwhelmingly nonviolent counterprotests at events like the October 2017 ""White Lives Matter Rally"" in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro, as well as made appearances at the annual American Renaissance conference held at Tennessee's Montgomery Bell State Park. The conference, which was canceled this year due to the coronavirus and therefore did not prompt a protest, is held by a white nationalist organization. The protest groups are typically met with a large number of park rangers and forced to demonstrate behind barriers, limiting the possibility for physical confrontations with the conference-goers. While some small altercations have taken place between protesters and counterprotesters at those events, there is no evidence that antifa activists have been responsible for inciting any type of significant violence in Tennessee. They frequently inhabit a very insular online space, trading jabs with individuals they believe to espouse white supremacist beliefs. As with other antifa activists around the nation, Jam City Antifa, a Nashville-based network, has been known to track area white supremacists and post photos and other identifying information about them online, sometimes encouraging followers to show up to heckle them at events. White supremacists have in turn done the same for antifa activists in the area. Last year, U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Knoxville, filed the ""Unmasking Antifa Act,"" legislation that sought to punish up to 15 years a person wearing a mask or disguise while committing a crime, including threatening or intimidating another individual ""exercising their constitutional rights or privileges,"" according to a statement from Burchett's office at the time. ""It’s time we get tough on this issue. These cowards wouldn’t act the way they do if the whole world could see their faces,” Burchett said at the time, which was pre-coronavirus pandemic. Trump's administration quick to cast blame on antifa amid protests U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Sunday also blamed antifa and other similar groups over the violent protests around the country. Barr did not say what specific groups may have been involved or where they came from, but he said the Justice Department and the FBI will work on identifying “criminal organizers and instigators” to be arrested and charged Trump's national security advisor Robert O'Brien told CNN Sunday that the administration planned to ""get to the bottom"" of antifa's role in the protests. And he said the president and Barr want to know what the FBI is doing to ""to track and dismantle and surveil and prosecute antifa."" O'Brien denounced ""these antifa militant radicals who come into our cities and cross state lines. ""They're organized, and use Molotov cocktails and fireworks and gas to burn down our cities, especially businesses in minority neighborhoods. It's got to be stopped,"" he said on ""State of the Union."" But some have blamed right-wing provocateurs seeking to incite a race war for the violence. ""The truth is nobody really knows,"" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Sunday on NBC News' ""Meet the Press."" ""What the exact political motivation is is unclear at this point. We need to investigate it,"" Ellison said. USA Today and Adam Tamburin contributed to this report. Reach Natalie Allison at nallison@tennessean.com. Follow her on Twitter at @natalie_allison.

They had closed early as a peaceful protest against police brutality and the killing of George Floyd was followed by destruction in downtown Nashville. The staff, unable to leave in time, waited for it to end. When the sun rose Sunday, it revealed broken glass, a smashed cash register, stage equipment dragged into the street and potential evidence that someone tried — unsuccessfully — to start a fire. At least 30 businesses were damaged overnight. ""We've had a lot of folks helping (clean up), and that's the main thing, that everybody's OK,"" owner Brenda Sanderson told The Tennessean on Sunday morning. Multiple community members volunteered in the cleanup effort Sunday, scrubbing spray paint off walls, boarding windows and sweeping shattered glass. Tom Morales, owner of Acme Feed & Seed and The Southern, said Nashville faces the challenge of rebuilding both its businesses and public trust. His businesses made it through unmarred. ""I really believe the people who are trying to deliver the message (against police brutality) were hijacked by a small group of men, boys and kids that society produces because they're trapped in a situation where they have no opportunity,"" Morales said. The Equity Alliance, which organized the peaceful demonstration attended by both protesters and local officials Saturday afternoon, condemned the violence Sunday, stating that ""those individuals defacing and destroying public property after the rally were not a part of the original event."" In Morales' view, discrimination, the existing financial struggles of many and the widespread impacts of the pandemic brought tensions to a boiling point. ""You look at all of the broken parts of American society, and this is revealing it (all), and that's the sad part,"" Morales said. ""This is endemic of how frustrated people get,"" he said. ""When Americans go one week (without pay) and they're out of money, and now they're going to start evicting them, the height of the frustration has not even gotten to the ivory towers yet. If we don't, as a country, come together, all of these towers they're building in Nashville are going to be like gravestones."" Steve Smith, owner of Tootsie's, Honky Tonk Central and Rippy's Bar and Grill, said none of his buildings were damaged and no one in his establishments was hurt. ""It's horrible,"" he said. ""People should be out lighting candles for this young man that got killed. They shouldn't be out burning businesses down and destroying property."" Smith's bars have long staffed armed security guards, and Smith said they've been told to shoot if anyone puts their customers or staff in danger. ""If somebody comes in and sets your house on fire, are you going to shoot them?"" Smith said. ""I am.""

""I'm without question at a loss for words, stunned by what I saw, and sad for Nashville, because that's not who we are,"" he said. Spyridon does not yet know the extent of the damage, but he estimated it could be hundreds of thousands of dollars based on what he saw unfold on television. Although repairs will slow the city's recovery from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Spyridon has faith in Nashville's ability to bounce back. After the streets cleared Saturday night, a construction worker began boarding up broken windows along Broadway on his own volition. He's an example of Nashville's strength, Spyridon said. ""That's Nashville, responding immediately, even faster than immediately — that's the sign of who we are,"" he said. Jessica Bliss contributed to this report.

Leaders of the statewide non-profit issued the following statement attributed to co-founders and co-executive directors Charlane Oliver and Tequila Johnson: “Our organization, in cooperation with other activists, held a peaceful rally today to protest the murder of Minneapolis resident George Floyd by police as well as to deliver a clear message to Metro and state government leaders that Tennesseans deeply oppose racism and police brutality. The event drew some 4,000 attendees and our staff registered over 300 new voters. It was a peaceful assembly. “It is our firm belief that those individuals defacing and destroying public property after the rally were not a part of the original event. The actions by this small group reflect neither the beliefs of the groups that led today’s peaceful assembly nor those of the majority of the attendees. This behavior dishonors the memory of George Floyd and other black Americans that have died unjustly at the hands of police. “The Equity Alliance condemns and disavows tonight’s violent rioting. We urge anyone feeling heartfelt, honest anger over the murder of George Floyd to direct that energy toward November’s election. The only true way to change our nation for the better is by taking up our civic duty as Americans and making it clear with our vote that we reject racism in all its forms.” 10:38 p.m. A window was broken at the historic Ryman Auditorium in downtown Nashville tonight.

They didn’t interact with the demonstrators. Original story: Nashville Mayor John Cooper said he would attend a Saturday afternoon rally protesting police brutality and racism following the death of George Floyd. Cooper encouraged members of the city council to join him at the 3 p.m. rally at Legislative Plaza, which follows a wave of protests in other cities. The mayor said it was ""an especially critical time for all of us, as Metro’s leaders, to show up and listen to black voices speaking out from across Davidson County."" Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer kept a knee pressed into his neck for more than eight minutes. The officer, Derek Michael Chauvin, 44, was arrested and charged with murder. Floyd's death intensified anger and frustration for many who say it is an example of pervasive racism among law enforcement nationwide. Protests have swept through many major cities. Friday night protests in Memphis and Knoxville were peaceful, but violence has erupted during protests in Minneapolis, Louisville and Atlanta. Organizers of the Nashville rally said they wanted to create a peaceful and safe space for people to express their grief and call for change. Organizer Hamid Abdullah said Floyd's death had become a tipping point within the movement against racism and police brutality. ""More people are coming together. More people are listening. More people are paying attention,"" Abdullah said. ""People are fed up with brutality and they want to do something."" Abdullah said he welcomed ""all people of good will"" to the rally. He said he hoped Cooper would understand the need to make changes to prevent similar deaths in the future.

The ongoing debate over policing and racial bias has been a prominent part of life in Nashville for years. In 2018, local activists spurred a citywide vote that created the Community Oversight Board, a civilian panel that investigates allegations of police misconduct. The vote came after a white police officer shot Daniel Hambrick, 25, a black man, while he was running away during a foot pursuit. That officer, Andrew Delke, 26, was arrested and charged with murder. The case is pending. Reach Adam Tamburin at 615-726-5986 and atamburin@tennessean.com. Follow him on Twitter @tamburintweets.

Bill Lee said Sunday he is increasing a deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to help with law enforcement, this time in all three divisions of the state. The governor made the announcement one day after 75 guardsmen were deployed in Nashville in response to an eruption of violence. The rancor occurred after a peaceful rally attended by thousands of Tennesseans who were protesting police brutality and racism. The governor did not say how many and exactly where the guardsmen will be deployed Sunday. Additionally, Lee announced a joint effort between the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement to investigate Saturday's violence in Nashville, which he said was provoked by many non-Tennesseans. “The right to peaceful protest is foundational to our country, but the violence and vandalism that occurred in Nashville last night was unlawful and tears at the fabric of our community,” Lee said in a statement. “We have reason to believe that many of those involved in unlawful acts are not Tennesseans and we will be working with law enforcement to investigate this further and bring those responsible to justice.” The violence occurred hours after thousands of people gathered near the Capitol for a peaceful rally, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Organizers of Saturday's rally urged participants to remain peaceful but violence later erupted throughout the city's downtown area, including windows being smashed and a fire being set at the city's historic Metro Courthouse, which includes city hall offices. In total, 28 Metro Nashville police arrested 28 people Saturday night, many after the 10 p.m. curfew. Of those, 21 are from Nashville, four from elsewhere in Tennessee and three from out of state: Texas, Illinois and New York. Saturday's deployment of the National Guard, which was aimed at providing assistance to the Tennessee Highway Patrol and Metro Police Department, was likely the first such move for law enforcement purposes in decades. The guardsmen first reported to the Capitol grounds, where a statue was toppled over. The troops later moved to Lower Broadway, to provide assistance after businesses were damaged.

(Photo: Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean) David Roberson, a spokesman for the Department of General Services, said the extent of damage to state-owned property included graffiti and broken windows and doors. Roberson said windows were broken at the War Memorial building, the Rachel Jackson and Andrew Jackson buildings and Citizens Plaza, where graffiti was also found. A door was broken at the state Supreme Court. Graffiti was found on the Capitol grounds, including on a wall. The toppled statue was to be removed Sunday. Roberson said there are no estimates of the total cost of the various damage to state-owned properties. Lee's deployment of the National Guard came at the request of Nashville Mayor John Cooper, said Laine Arnold, the governor's spokeswoman. The governor made the announcement shortly after 9 p.m. Lee signed an executive order, effectively affirming a 10 p.m. curfew Cooper implemented. ""I mobilized the National Guard to assist in protecting the lives and property of Tennesseans, which is a critical responsibility of government,"" the governor's executive order stated. The governor signed another executive order on Sunday to once again coincide with Nashville's latest curfew, which is set for 8 p.m. Tennessee's last major deployment of its National Guard for law enforcement purposes occurred in 1968, after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As many as 4,000 guardsmen were deployed in Nashville the day King was murdered, according to The Tennessean's archives. Troops were stationed throughout the city, including standing guard, complete with rifles and bayonets, outside the state Capitol. The National Guard was deployed throughout Nashville for several days after King's assassination. Guardsmen were also deployed in Memphis.

1621727289,2020-05-31 15:30:59,President Trump wants to declare antifa a terrorist group. Here's what we know about their Tennessee activities.,http://rssfeeds.knoxnews.com/~/625702726/0/knoxville/home/~President-Trump-wants-to-declare-antifa-a-terrorist-group-Heres-what-we-know-about-their-Tennessee-activities/,en,False,,89,The Knoxville News Sentinel ,http://www.knoxnews.com/,"President Donald Trump has announced he intends to designate a militant anti-racist movement a terrorist organization as violent protests attended by a variety of activists have erupted in cities around the country, including Nashville. The protests, some of which have resulted in destruction of property and violent clashes with police, are being held in response to police killing George Floyd in Minneapolis and other black individuals who have recently died at the hands of law enforcement. ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,"" Trump said during remarks at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday, though it's unclear by what legal mechanism he can designate a domestic organization to be a terrorist group. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a left-wing activist movement active globally, including in Tennessee. The loosely affiliated groups frequently advocate for anti-racist policies, though often take an anarchist and militant approach. There is no formal leadership or unified national structure to the movement. It is not one organization, but rather loose network of activists using a ""black bloc"" tactic at protests — dressing in all black and concealing their faces with masks and bandannas. Multiple antifa groups have been based in Nashville in recent years. No clear evidence antifa organized violent protests in Nashville While many of the protesters in Nashville on Saturday fit that description, it's unclear if any affiliate with antifa organizations. Metro Nashville Police Department Chief Steve Anderson said Sunday the city is investigating a small group of people they believe used the protest as a cover for violence and other criminal acts. The police chief did not say if any organized groups might be behind the violence in Nashville. A peaceful rally held downtown Saturday afternoon evolved throughout the evening, eventually turning from a march into a chaotic eruption of vandalism to public and private property. Metro Nashville's historic courthouse and city hall were set afire in the process, among other significant damage the building sustained. Antifa groups have, however, openly mobilized overwhelmingly nonviolent counterprotests at events like the October 2017 ""White Lives Matter Rally"" in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro, as well as made appearances at the annual American Renaissance conference held at Tennessee's Montgomery Bell State Park. The conference, which was canceled this year due to the coronavirus and therefore did not prompt a protest, is held by a white nationalist organization. The protest groups are typically met with a large number of park rangers and forced to demonstrate behind barriers, limiting the possibility for physical confrontations with the conference-goers. While some small altercations have taken place between protesters and counterprotesters at those events, there is no evidence that antifa activists have been responsible for inciting any type of significant violence in Tennessee. They frequently inhabit a very insular online space, trading jabs with individuals they believe to espouse white supremacist beliefs. As with other antifa activists around the nation, Jam City Antifa, a Nashville-based network, has been known to track area white supremacists and post photos and other identifying information about them online, sometimes encouraging followers to show up to heckle them at events. White supremacists have in turn done the same for antifa activists in the area. Last year, U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Knoxville, filed the ""Unmasking Antifa Act,"" legislation that sought to punish up to 15 years a person wearing a mask or disguise while committing a crime, including threatening or intimidating another individual ""exercising their constitutional rights or privileges,"" according to a statement from Burchett's office at the time. ""It’s time we get tough on this issue. These cowards wouldn’t act the way they do if the whole world could see their faces,” Burchett said at the time, which was pre-coronavirus pandemic. Trump's administration quick to cast blame on antifa amid protests U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Sunday also blamed antifa and other similar groups over the violent protests around the country. Barr did not say what specific groups may have been involved or where they came from, but he said the Justice Department and the FBI will work on identifying “criminal organizers and instigators” to be arrested and charged Trump's national security advisor Robert O'Brien told CNN Sunday that the administration planned to ""get to the bottom"" of antifa's role in the protests. And he said the president and Barr want to know what the FBI is doing to ""to track and dismantle and surveil and prosecute antifa."" O'Brien denounced ""these antifa militant radicals who come into our cities and cross state lines. ""They're organized, and use Molotov cocktails and fireworks and gas to burn down our cities, especially businesses in minority neighborhoods. It's got to be stopped,"" he said on ""State of the Union."" But some have blamed right-wing provocateurs seeking to incite a race war for the violence. ""The truth is nobody really knows,"" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Sunday on NBC News' ""Meet the Press."" ""What the exact political motivation is is unclear at this point. We need to investigate it,"" Ellison said. USA Today and Adam Tamburin contributed to this report. Reach Natalie Allison at nallison@tennessean.com. Follow her on Twitter at @natalie_allison.

Hayes said on Facebook that he ""watched teens around me"" get shot by the pepper-filled balls and added, ""minor damage to a couple windows and trashcans did not warrant the behavior shown by kpd."" Scott Erland, Knoxville Police Department spokesperson, confirmed to Knox News that police shot the balls at protesters after two orders to disperse had been given and ""to prevent further unlawful activity and uphold public safety."" A crowd of 50 to 100 people moved quickly through Market Square late Saturday night, smashing windows and destroying planters. It was not initially clear if Hayes was connected to the group at Market Square. Derek Valentine of Knoxville said he was in the square at about 11:30 p.m. Saturday and saw dozens of people had amassed in front of Urban Outfitters. He said several police cars arrived and officers, including some in riot gear, confronted the crowd, some shooting pepper-filled balls. He said the crowd then moved quickly across the square, and a small number in the group destroyed property as they fled from the police.

(Photo: Chuck Campbell/News Sentinel) The Knoxville Police Department issued a statement Sunday morning about the vandalism on Market Square. According to KPD's release, two people were arrested, including a 20-year-old male who was arrested outside the Market Square Garage around 1 a.m. after officers searched him and the vehicle. Police confiscated six handguns, two shotguns, two rifles and narcotics. He was charged with possession with intent to sell Schedule I drugs, possession with intent to sell Schedule II drugs and possession of firearm during commission of dangerous felony. An 18-year-old male was arrested after allegedly throwing an object into a police SUV that struck a KPD officer in the head. The officer was uninjured. The 18-year-old was taken into custody and charged with assault, disorderly conduct, evading arrest, resisting arrest and inciting to riot. A second KPD officer sustained a minor injury during the arrest and was driven to Knoxville Fire Department Station 1 to receive first aid. No other injuries were reported, according to the release. By 2 a.m. all the groups had left the downtown area. KPD is assessing vandalism that happened in the area overnight. Erland told Knox News that the organizers of Saturday's protest have not been identified, but ""it was apparent that they were coordinated in some capacity."" Friday protest was peaceful Outrage over police brutality continued to boil over in cities across the nation, including in Nashville Saturday night, though a large demonstration in Knoxville on Friday evening was notably peaceful, with no arrests or reports of violence, according to the Knoxville Police Department. Yet Knoxville businesses began to shutter early and helicopters swirled over downtown Saturday evening as protests across the country turned violent. Black Lives Matter supporters marched by the hundreds through the heart of downtown Knoxville Friday without conflict, demanding justice in the police killing of George Floyd. Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon, who had said in a statement Friday afternoon that she was ""outraged"" by the brutal actions of police in Floyd's death, told Knox News on Saturday that for Friday's demonstration she wanted the city's police ""to keep as low of a profile as possible"" in an effort to avoid confrontation.

1621729847,2020-05-31 12:55:36,75 National Guardsmen were deployed Saturday in Nashville during protests,http://rssfeeds.knoxnews.com/~/625694590/0/knoxville/home/~National-Guardsmen-were-deployed-Saturday-in-Nashville-during-protests/,en,False,,607964,Shopper News,https://www.knoxnews.com/shopper-news/,"Faced with the possibility of additional violence, Gov. Bill Lee said Sunday he is increasing a deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to help with law enforcement, this time in all three divisions of the state. The governor made the announcement one day after 75 guardsmen were deployed in Nashville in response to an eruption of violence. The rancor occurred after a peaceful rally attended by thousands of Tennesseans who were protesting police brutality and racism. The governor did not say how many and exactly where the guardsmen will be deployed Sunday. Additionally, Lee announced a joint effort between the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement to investigate Saturday's violence in Nashville, which he said was provoked by many non-Tennesseans. “The right to peaceful protest is foundational to our country, but the violence and vandalism that occurred in Nashville last night was unlawful and tears at the fabric of our community,” Lee said in a statement. “We have reason to believe that many of those involved in unlawful acts are not Tennesseans and we will be working with law enforcement to investigate this further and bring those responsible to justice.” The violence occurred hours after thousands of people gathered near the Capitol for a peaceful rally, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Organizers of Saturday's rally urged participants to remain peaceful but violence later erupted throughout the city's downtown area, including windows being smashed and a fire being set at the city's historic Metro Courthouse, which includes city hall offices. In total, 28 Metro Nashville police arrested 28 people Saturday night, many after the 10 p.m. curfew. Of those, 21 are from Nashville, four from elsewhere in Tennessee and three from out of state: Texas, Illinois and New York. Saturday's deployment of the National Guard, which was aimed at providing assistance to the Tennessee Highway Patrol and Metro Police Department, was likely the first such move for law enforcement purposes in decades. The guardsmen first reported to the Capitol grounds, where a statue was toppled over. The troops later moved to Lower Broadway, to provide assistance after businesses were damaged.

(Photo: Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean) David Roberson, a spokesman for the Department of General Services, said the extent of damage to state-owned property included graffiti and broken windows and doors. Roberson said windows were broken at the War Memorial building, the Rachel Jackson and Andrew Jackson buildings and Citizens Plaza, where graffiti was also found. A door was broken at the state Supreme Court. Graffiti was found on the Capitol grounds, including on a wall. The toppled statue was to be removed Sunday. Roberson said there are no estimates of the total cost of the various damage to state-owned properties. Lee's deployment of the National Guard came at the request of Nashville Mayor John Cooper, said Laine Arnold, the governor's spokeswoman. The governor made the announcement shortly after 9 p.m. Lee signed an executive order, effectively affirming a 10 p.m. curfew Cooper implemented. ""I mobilized the National Guard to assist in protecting the lives and property of Tennesseans, which is a critical responsibility of government,"" the governor's executive order stated. The governor signed another executive order on Sunday to once again coincide with Nashville's latest curfew, which is set for 8 p.m. Tennessee's last major deployment of its National Guard for law enforcement purposes occurred in 1968, after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As many as 4,000 guardsmen were deployed in Nashville the day King was murdered, according to The Tennessean's archives. Troops were stationed throughout the city, including standing guard, complete with rifles and bayonets, outside the state Capitol. The National Guard was deployed throughout Nashville for several days after King's assassination. Guardsmen were also deployed in Memphis.

1621729845,2020-05-31 15:30:59,President Trump wants to declare antifa a terrorist group. Here's what we know about their Tennessee activities.,http://rssfeeds.knoxnews.com/~/625702726/0/knoxville/home/~President-Trump-wants-to-declare-antifa-a-terrorist-group-Heres-what-we-know-about-their-Tennessee-activities/,en,False,,607964,Shopper News,https://www.knoxnews.com/shopper-news/,"President Donald Trump has announced he intends to designate a militant anti-racist movement a terrorist organization as violent protests attended by a variety of activists have erupted in cities around the country, including Nashville. The protests, some of which have resulted in destruction of property and violent clashes with police, are being held in response to police killing George Floyd in Minneapolis and other black individuals who have recently died at the hands of law enforcement. ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,"" Trump said during remarks at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday, though it's unclear by what legal mechanism he can designate a domestic organization to be a terrorist group. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a left-wing activist movement active globally, including in Tennessee. The loosely affiliated groups frequently advocate for anti-racist policies, though often take an anarchist and militant approach. There is no formal leadership or unified national structure to the movement. It is not one organization, but rather loose network of activists using a ""black bloc"" tactic at protests — dressing in all black and concealing their faces with masks and bandannas. Multiple antifa groups have been based in Nashville in recent years. No clear evidence antifa organized violent protests in Nashville While many of the protesters in Nashville on Saturday fit that description, it's unclear if any affiliate with antifa organizations. Metro Nashville Police Department Chief Steve Anderson said Sunday the city is investigating a small group of people they believe used the protest as a cover for violence and other criminal acts. The police chief did not say if any organized groups might be behind the violence in Nashville. A peaceful rally held downtown Saturday afternoon evolved throughout the evening, eventually turning from a march into a chaotic eruption of vandalism to public and private property. Metro Nashville's historic courthouse and city hall were set afire in the process, among other significant damage the building sustained. Antifa groups have, however, openly mobilized overwhelmingly nonviolent counterprotests at events like the October 2017 ""White Lives Matter Rally"" in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro, as well as made appearances at the annual American Renaissance conference held at Tennessee's Montgomery Bell State Park. The conference, which was canceled this year due to the coronavirus and therefore did not prompt a protest, is held by a white nationalist organization. The protest groups are typically met with a large number of park rangers and forced to demonstrate behind barriers, limiting the possibility for physical confrontations with the conference-goers. While some small altercations have taken place between protesters and counterprotesters at those events, there is no evidence that antifa activists have been responsible for inciting any type of significant violence in Tennessee. They frequently inhabit a very insular online space, trading jabs with individuals they believe to espouse white supremacist beliefs. As with other antifa activists around the nation, Jam City Antifa, a Nashville-based network, has been known to track area white supremacists and post photos and other identifying information about them online, sometimes encouraging followers to show up to heckle them at events. White supremacists have in turn done the same for antifa activists in the area. Last year, U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Knoxville, filed the ""Unmasking Antifa Act,"" legislation that sought to punish up to 15 years a person wearing a mask or disguise while committing a crime, including threatening or intimidating another individual ""exercising their constitutional rights or privileges,"" according to a statement from Burchett's office at the time. ""It’s time we get tough on this issue. These cowards wouldn’t act the way they do if the whole world could see their faces,” Burchett said at the time, which was pre-coronavirus pandemic. Trump's administration quick to cast blame on antifa amid protests U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Sunday also blamed antifa and other similar groups over the violent protests around the country. Barr did not say what specific groups may have been involved or where they came from, but he said the Justice Department and the FBI will work on identifying “criminal organizers and instigators” to be arrested and charged Trump's national security advisor Robert O'Brien told CNN Sunday that the administration planned to ""get to the bottom"" of antifa's role in the protests. And he said the president and Barr want to know what the FBI is doing to ""to track and dismantle and surveil and prosecute antifa."" O'Brien denounced ""these antifa militant radicals who come into our cities and cross state lines. ""They're organized, and use Molotov cocktails and fireworks and gas to burn down our cities, especially businesses in minority neighborhoods. It's got to be stopped,"" he said on ""State of the Union."" But some have blamed right-wing provocateurs seeking to incite a race war for the violence. ""The truth is nobody really knows,"" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Sunday on NBC News' ""Meet the Press."" ""What the exact political motivation is is unclear at this point. We need to investigate it,"" Ellison said. USA Today and Adam Tamburin contributed to this report. Reach Natalie Allison at nallison@tennessean.com. Follow her on Twitter at @natalie_allison.

Hayes said on Facebook that he ""watched teens around me"" get shot by the pepper-filled balls and added, ""minor damage to a couple windows and trashcans did not warrant the behavior shown by kpd."" Scott Erland, Knoxville Police Department spokesperson, confirmed to Knox News that police shot the balls at protesters after two orders to disperse had been given and ""to prevent further unlawful activity and uphold public safety."" A crowd of 50 to 100 people moved quickly through Market Square late Saturday night, smashing windows and destroying planters. It was not initially clear if Hayes was connected to the group at Market Square. Derek Valentine of Knoxville said he was in the square at about 11:30 p.m. Saturday and saw dozens of people had amassed in front of Urban Outfitters. He said several police cars arrived and officers, including some in riot gear, confronted the crowd, some shooting pepper-filled balls. He said the crowd then moved quickly across the square, and a small number in the group destroyed property as they fled from the police.

(Photo: Chuck Campbell/News Sentinel) The Knoxville Police Department issued a statement Sunday morning about the vandalism on Market Square. According to KPD's release, two people were arrested, including a 20-year-old male who was arrested outside the Market Square Garage around 1 a.m. after officers searched him and the vehicle. Police confiscated six handguns, two shotguns, two rifles and narcotics. He was charged with possession with intent to sell Schedule I drugs, possession with intent to sell Schedule II drugs and possession of firearm during commission of dangerous felony. An 18-year-old male was arrested after allegedly throwing an object into a police SUV that struck a KPD officer in the head. The officer was uninjured. The 18-year-old was taken into custody and charged with assault, disorderly conduct, evading arrest, resisting arrest and inciting to riot. A second KPD officer sustained a minor injury during the arrest and was driven to Knoxville Fire Department Station 1 to receive first aid. No other injuries were reported, according to the release. By 2 a.m. all the groups had left the downtown area. KPD is assessing vandalism that happened in the area overnight. Erland told Knox News that the organizers of Saturday's protest have not been identified, but ""it was apparent that they were coordinated in some capacity."" Friday protest was peaceful Outrage over police brutality continued to boil over in cities across the nation, including in Nashville Saturday night, though a large demonstration in Knoxville on Friday evening was notably peaceful, with no arrests or reports of violence, according to the Knoxville Police Department. Yet Knoxville businesses began to shutter early and helicopters swirled over downtown Saturday evening as protests across the country turned violent. Black Lives Matter supporters marched by the hundreds through the heart of downtown Knoxville Friday without conflict, demanding justice in the police killing of George Floyd. Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon, who had said in a statement Friday afternoon that she was ""outraged"" by the brutal actions of police in Floyd's death, told Knox News on Saturday that for Friday's demonstration she wanted the city's police ""to keep as low of a profile as possible"" in an effort to avoid confrontation. Peaceful protests turned destructive in Nashville Saturday as demonstrators set fire to the Metro Courthouse and tore down a controversial statue, and the city was put on curfew. Mayor John Cooper declared a state of civil emergency and Gov. Bill Lee deployed the National Guard.

(AP Photo/Kimberlee Kruesi) NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Nashville’s honky tonks and other businesses boarded up their smashed store fronts, while cleanup crews began scrubbing graffiti and removing debris Sunday following a protest in response to the death of George Floyd. According to Metro Nashville Police, at least 30 businesses and buildings were damaged after a peaceful “I Will Breathe” demonstration turned violent on Saturday. The rally was held to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck. RELATED: Protests emerge across Tennessee after the death of George Floyd in Minnesota However, after the two-hour organized rally concluded, tensions escalated as protesters moved away from the state Capitol to a downtown Nashville police precinct. Fires were lit inside and outside the city’s historic courthouse, and a statue of a former state lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views was toppled. Only until a 10 p.m. curfew was ordered did the protesters finally begin to disperse. By Sunday, the same area was quiet with business owners covering up smashed windows as spectators somberly took photos of the destruction. Yet the emotions of the night were still being felt as one black man stood quietly holding one arm up watching the courthouse be cleaned. Mayor John Cooper described Saturday as a “heartbreaking night” for Nashville, noting that the area had recently already been ravaged by a fatal tornado nearly three months before that shortly followed the COVID-19 pandemic. Cooper ordered a new curfew of 8 p.m. Sunday night. He and other community leaders, lamented that most of the destruction centered around Metro Nashville Courthouse and City Hall, where multiple fires went off in and around the building after protesters smashed in windows and spray-painted obscenities along the walls and nearby structures. “Our metro courthouse, iconic for its role in the civil rights movement, was the site of much of tonight’s reprehensible vandalism,” Cooper said. “Sixty years ago, 3,000 nonviolent protesters marched to that same courthouse in a milestone moment for integration and yet tonight that same courthouse was defaced and set on fire.” In 1960, area college student leaders in the sit-in movement challenged the injustice of desegregated lunch counters in a confrontation on the courthouse steps. After the mayor agreed that it was wrong, Nashville became the first southern city in the U.S. to desegregate its lunch counters. Gov. Bill Lee authorized the National Guard to mobilize at the request of Cooper. More than 300 guardsman had been tapped to help in the “restoring order and limiting the destruction of property for as long as needed,” according to a statement. Meanwhile, Metro Nashville Police tweeted that 28 people were arrested during the protest and four others were arrested after a 10 p.m. curfew was implemented Saturday evening. Demonstrators earlier in the evening pulled down a statue outside the state Capitol of Edward Carmack. Carmack was a politician in the early 1900s who wrote editorials lambasting the writings of prominent Tennessee civil rights journalist Ida B. Wells. He was fatally shot in 1908 by a political rival.

(AP Photo/Kimberlee Kruesi) Meanwhile, two Nashville malls announced they would remain closed on Sunday following the protest. The decision comes after retail stores have just recently been allowed to reopen due to the coronavirus outbreak. Other parts of Tennessee also saw smaller protests clash with police on Saturday. As in Nashville, police donned riot gear in Memphis due to a standoff with a crowd on Beale Street. Earlier that evening, protesters had held a demonstration at the National Civil Rights Museum, marking the fourth night in a row people had gathered in response to George Floyd’s death. In Knoxville, police officials say a group of 50-100 individuals committed “numerous acts of vandalism” in the downtown area late Saturday by shooting fireworks, throwing trash cans into the road and smashing a portable toilet. Police say an 18-year-old male was arrested after he allegedly threw an object into a police SUV, which hit a police officer on the head. LATEST STORIES:",0.0
1621738633,2020-05-31 22:57:00,Protestors Damaged Property Throughout Downtown Chattanooga; Threw Rocks At Police; Fought Officers; Blocked Roadways,http://www.chattanoogan.com/2020/5/31/409826/Protestors-Damaged-Property-Throughout.aspx,en,False,,663090,Chattanoogan,http://www.chattanoogan.com/Breaking-News/,"Chattanooga Police said protestors damaged property throughout downtown Chattanooga, threw rocks at police, fought with officers, and blocked roadways during several hours of tumult late Saturday night and early Sunday morning. Twelve were arrested, including several from out of town. After the arrests the group of around 150 protestors surrounded the downtown jail and courts area before finally dispersing around 3 a.m. There were several separate protests downtown on Saturday relating to the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. Marchers yelled ""No Justice. No Peace"" as they marched across the Walnut Street Bridge early Saturday evening. Police said they tried to break up the large ""rancorous"" crowd unsuccessfully for around three hours, then acts of vandalism and confrontations with officers began around 11 p.m. in North Chattanooga. They continued for several more tense hours. Officers who were summoned to the scene included Chattanooga Police, Sheriff's officers and Tennessee Highway Patrol. Police Chief David Roddy was at the scene throughout the day attempting to communicate with the group. The protestors occupied all four lanes of the Market Street Bridge as they headed toward the north side of the river. At the intersection of Market and Frazier they began a ""sit in"" at the busy intersection. Ordered to quit blocking the roadway, the group rose and began marching down the center of Frazier Avenue heading east. A pedestrian lane was open and attempts were made to steer the group toward Coolidge Park. The group resisted and camped at the intersection of Frazier and Tremont, while completely taking over the eastbound lanes. Officers formed a line and were able to move the protestors off the roadway, then there was a surge back onto Frazier by the group, police said. At this time Caleb Jenkins, Erica Chacon, Taira Truss and Colby Prigmore were taken into custody. Jenkins is from 404 Coffee Lane, Loudon, Tn. Ms. Chacon is from 175 Corvin Meadows Lane, Dayton, Tn., Ms. Truss is from 709 N. Holly St., and Prigmore is from 210 Railroad St., Dayton, Tn. Police also arrested Sydnie R. Jeffers, of 901 Mountain Creek Road, Apt. 155, for refusing repeated commands to get out of the roadway. Police said prior to 1 a.m., the large group headed back toward downtown over the Walnut Street Bridge. They ""proceeded to travel around the city damaging property all over the downtown area. They went as far south as MLK Boulevard, then along Chestnut ""continuing to damage property around the city."" At 7th and Market, an officer took Kristin Holloway, of 821 W. 14th St. Court, into custody for ""obstructing a roadway when asked, inciting a riot, and disorderly conduct."" Police said he refused to move out of the roadway and was also seen knocking a civilian down. They next gathered near Buffalo Wild Wings at 100 Market St. just before 1 a.m. They ""were continually ordered to peacefully disperse."" Police said two individuals began throwing rocks at officers. They said Denishia Price, of 261 Long Island Road, South Pittsburg, was taken into custody after a chase. Police said during this arrest an individual named Dylan Hardwick approached police yelling. He ""was detained until police could calm the scene down."" Hardwick, of 4112 E. Stump St., East Ridge, was arrested. A large rock was then thrown at officers seeking to disperse the crowd. It struck a patrol car and came close to an officer who was standing behind the vehicle. At that point an officer noticed an individual in a dark shirt running up the hill from Market Street toward the Hunter Museum. The officer said he began to crest the hill at Aquarium Way as bits of concrete were still being thrown at him. Another officer joined in the pursuit as they got to the top of the hill and saw two individuals running away. The pair refused commands to halt. The officers caught up with the pair at the Hunter Museum. One of the officers drew his tazer on Skyler Dover and he took the tazer away. An officer said he then ""stunned (Dover) in the small of his back and it was effective."" Dover, of 1406 Morris Hill Road, was then taken into custody along with the female with him. Back at Market Street near Buffalo Wild Wings officers formed a line to try to keep protestors from entering the streets. Police said a white male tried to push through the line of officers and physically made contact with them. Police said the man, Eric L. Morton, of 310 Marilyn Dr., Jasper, Tn., again tried to push through officers and became physical. It took several officers to take him to the ground and get him into custody, it was stated. At the same location, police said Darryon Wood pushed officers and tried to assist a friend to get away. Wood, of 1109 E. 8th St., was then taken into custody. A short time later, police said an officer was pushed by Shaun McAfee, of 1446 Bradt St. McAfee was removed from the protest area and taken into custody. Click here for video of the march on Walnut Street. In Nashville protestors set fire to the courthouse. They also toppled a statue to Edward Ward Carmack, a politician and newspaperman who had a running battle with civil rights activist Ida B. Wells. Tennessee Governor Bill Lee responded by calling out the National Guard, and a 10 p.m. curfew was set. The governor said, ""At the request of Mayor Cooper, I am authorizing the National Guard to mobilize in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville. The threat to both peace and property is unacceptable and we will work with local law enforcement and community leaders to restore safety and order. This is not a reflection of our state or the fundamental American right to peaceful protest.”",0.0

The announcement on Saturday from the nation's eighth-largest retailer came after Target stores in multiple cities became scenes of violence and unrest. Among the stores where aisles were ransacked was a Target in Minneapolis near the city's 3rd police precinct, where the four officers who were fired after Floyd's death worked. The 3rd Precinct police station was damaged by a fire last week. ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,"" the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. ""At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores."" A Target spokesperson said that the company is evaluating closures and limiting hours on a store-by-store basis. The majority of stores being closed are located in Minnesota and California, where protests in Los Angeles led the National Guard to be deployed. Stores will also close in Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Despite the violence that has hit its stores, the company has voiced support for demonstrators. ""The murder of George Floyd has unleashed the pent-up pain of years, as have the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote in a public letter on Friday. ""We say their names and hold a too-long list of others in our hearts."" It remains unclear whether the looting at Target stores was committed by demonstrators or whether they were the actions of unaffiliated bad actors. But the ongoing demonstrations have focused scrutiny on Target's past work with law enforcement — including partnerships with agencies in at least 2o cities. In Minneapolis, the company partnered with police on a program that helped install closed-circuit television cameras in the downtown area. A 2010 report released with support from the company said the ""genesis of the program was a widespread feeling some years ago in the city of Minneapolis that the downtown business district was not a pleasant place to work or visit.""

The president has said that members of the loosely defined far-left group Antifa — short for ""anti-fascists"" — have led clashes with police and looting in cities across the U.S. since the killing of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis. It's unclear if any group or groups are primarily responsible for escalating protests that began following George Floyd's death on May 25 as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has told the press that he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence. In one tweet on Sunday, Trump said the U.S. ""will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" It's something he has previously floated, and last year two Republican senators introduced a resolution that sought to designate the group as a domestic terrorist organization. Following Trump's tweet, Attorney General William Barr said in a statement that ""[f]ederal law enforcement actions will be directed at apprehending and charging the violent radical agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest."" Barr added: ""The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly."" The clashes, spreading to dozens of cities across the U.S., follow a series of racist incidents and deaths of black people, including Floyd's on Monday. Chauvin, now a former Minneapolis police officer, was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck while holding him in custody as Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers present at the scene have been fired but not arrested or charged. Protests and clashes that have since followed come at a time of unprecedented crisis for the country, with confirmed deaths from the coronavirus pandemic topping 100,000 and millions of people out of work as a result of broad business shutdowns. Minorities, including African Americans, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 deaths and pandemic-induced economic peril.

It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger, and grief."" pic.twitter.com/lirAMSv4Wo — The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 30, 2020 Trump addressed the demonstrations Saturday, striking a milder tone than he has on Twitter during prepared remarks following a space launch in Florida. He said Floyd's death ""has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger and grief."" He added that he ""understands the pain that people are feeling"" and supports peaceful protest, but that ""the memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists."" ""He should just sometimes stop talking"" Apart from Saturday's remarks, though, Trump has not often played a unifying role in recent days. His tweets about radical-left anarchists have also included criticism of Democratic leadership in Minnesota. In another tweet on Sunday, he blamed the mainstream media for fomenting ""hatred and anarchy."" Time for a change! #2020 https://t.co/AECy2GBfys — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020 On Friday, Trump tweeted provocatively that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase with a racist history that Trump said he was not aware of. Later on, he said his intent was not to make a threat but to register a statement of concern that armed violence can accompany looting. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, said on Fox News Sunday that the president's tweets about demonstrations turning violent are ""not constructive."" Speaking on ABC's This Week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Sunday morning that she's not paying attention to Trump's inflammatory tweets. Instead, she said he ""should be a unifying force in our country. We have seen that with Democratic and Republican presidents all along.

Also Sunday, Keisha Lance Bottoms — mayor of Atlanta, one city that has seen protests and clashes with police — told CBS' Face the Nation that Trump's tweets are ""making it worse"" and ""he should just sometimes stop talking."" In his own statement on Saturday, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, wrote that ""Protesting [Floyd's killing] is right and necessary.

""This is not a reflection of our state or the fundamental American right to peaceful protest."" Unrest in Memphis, Chattanooga and Knoxville In Memphis, about two hours after a demonstration against police brutality ended peacefully Saturday, a chaotic few seconds changed the tone. In a dramatic standoff, some people who remained in the crowd of about 60 demonstrators crossed a barricade near the Orpheum Theatre, which was set up to separate protesters from police. When they did, horses holding mounted officers spooked and shuffled. Barricades tumbled to the ground and people fell down. Police moved forward. Glass bottles flew through the air. The unrest marked a shift from the previous days — and that night's earlier events during which demonstrators marched and police largely let demonstrations play out on their own, without interference or arrests. Most of the crowd from Saturday's protest left around 9 p.m. from the National Civil Rights Museum, a short walk from Beale Street. But several dozen stayed. By 11:30 p.m., there were about 35 officers with riot shields, including one armed with a long gun, on the scene near the crowd. stand (Photo: Joe Rondone) A key leader of the earlier protest, DeVante Hill, commented on Twitter: ""Tonight just when I thought things were over and we could successfully say we had a peaceful protest, there were young men and women who staggered around near Beale and Main.

A crowd of 30 staggering people met with intense force like that is just uneasy for not only me to understand but a group of my other white brothers and sisters present as well,"" Hill wrote. In Chattanooga on Saturday night, overturned trash cans littered the streets as protesters threw rocks and at least one firework, sending others scattering as it exploded. Groups of demonstrators crowded Market Street after midnight, and several arrests were made. A crowd moved quickly through Market Square in Knoxville late Saturday night, smashing windows and destroying planters. Two men were arrested in separate incidents, including a 20-year-old male with six handguns, two shotguns, two rifles and narcotics. In the unrest, activist and former Knoxville City Council candidate David Hayes said on social media that he was shot with pepper-filled balls by police while he was escorting young protesters. Nashville activist: 'The narrative is changing' Nashville, too, saw conflict and destruction erupt in the aftermath of a peaceful protest. The historic Metro Courthouse burned, flames swelling through the first-floor windows. Clouds of tear gas mushroomed across Public Square Plaza. Spray paint tagged the walls. And the granite plaque commemorating Diane Nash, a civil rights leader in Nashville, was broken to pieces — its shards used to shatter windows. It left a mark on a city already scarred by the decimation of deadly tornadoes and the forced isolation of a pandemic. An 8 p.m. curfew was put in place for Nashville on Sunday after Mayor John Cooper, who had earlier Saturday attended the ""I Will Breathe"" rally to decry police brutality, declared a state of emergency. The order came, even as more demonstrations, including a Sunday vigil honoring Floyd's memory prepared to begin in Murfreesboro. Late morning, several streets leading to the Public Square were blocked by dump trucks and garbage trucks as fencing was set up and business owners preemptively boarded up their windows. ""We felt comfortable and knew it would be peaceful,"" said Scarlett Murphy, who owns Domenico's deli with husband Jeff Murphy. ""Then we started getting texts and calls that the people who weren't involved in the peaceful part were also coming, so we decided it would be best to be safe than sorry."" At 3:30 p.m., Murfreesboro organizers led a prayer circle where a diverse crowd of approximately 300 people gathered. Attendees chanted, ""No justice, no peace,"" followed by ""No racist, no peace,"" before heading on a march around the square where they continued chanting as they walked.

1621757463,2020-05-31 15:30:59,President Trump wants to declare antifa a terrorist group. Here's what we know about their Tennessee activities.,http://rssfeeds.commercialappeal.com/~/625702726/0/memphis/home~President-Trump-wants-to-declare-antifa-a-terrorist-group-Heres-what-we-know-about-their-Tennessee-activities/,en,False,,71,The Commercial Appeal,http://www.commercialappeal.com/,"President Donald Trump has announced he intends to designate a militant anti-racist movement a terrorist organization as violent protests attended by a variety of activists have erupted in cities around the country, including Nashville. The protests, some of which have resulted in destruction of property and violent clashes with police, are being held in response to police killing George Floyd in Minneapolis and other black individuals who have recently died at the hands of law enforcement. ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,"" Trump said during remarks at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday, though it's unclear by what legal mechanism he can designate a domestic organization to be a terrorist group. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a left-wing activist movement active globally, including in Tennessee. The loosely affiliated groups frequently advocate for anti-racist policies, though often take an anarchist and militant approach. There is no formal leadership or unified national structure to the movement. It is not one organization, but rather loose network of activists using a ""black bloc"" tactic at protests — dressing in all black and concealing their faces with masks and bandannas. Multiple antifa groups have been based in Nashville in recent years. No clear evidence antifa organized violent protests in Nashville While many of the protesters in Nashville on Saturday fit that description, it's unclear if any affiliate with antifa organizations. Metro Nashville Police Department Chief Steve Anderson said Sunday the city is investigating a small group of people they believe used the protest as a cover for violence and other criminal acts. The police chief did not say if any organized groups might be behind the violence in Nashville. A peaceful rally held downtown Saturday afternoon evolved throughout the evening, eventually turning from a march into a chaotic eruption of vandalism to public and private property. Metro Nashville's historic courthouse and city hall were set afire in the process, among other significant damage the building sustained. Antifa groups have, however, openly mobilized overwhelmingly nonviolent counterprotests at events like the October 2017 ""White Lives Matter Rally"" in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro, as well as made appearances at the annual American Renaissance conference held at Tennessee's Montgomery Bell State Park. The conference, which was canceled this year due to the coronavirus and therefore did not prompt a protest, is held by a white nationalist organization. The protest groups are typically met with a large number of park rangers and forced to demonstrate behind barriers, limiting the possibility for physical confrontations with the conference-goers. While some small altercations have taken place between protesters and counterprotesters at those events, there is no evidence that antifa activists have been responsible for inciting any type of significant violence in Tennessee. They frequently inhabit a very insular online space, trading jabs with individuals they believe to espouse white supremacist beliefs. As with other antifa activists around the nation, Jam City Antifa, a Nashville-based network, has been known to track area white supremacists and post photos and other identifying information about them online, sometimes encouraging followers to show up to heckle them at events. White supremacists have in turn done the same for antifa activists in the area. Last year, U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Knoxville, filed the ""Unmasking Antifa Act,"" legislation that sought to punish up to 15 years a person wearing a mask or disguise while committing a crime, including threatening or intimidating another individual ""exercising their constitutional rights or privileges,"" according to a statement from Burchett's office at the time. ""It’s time we get tough on this issue. These cowards wouldn’t act the way they do if the whole world could see their faces,” Burchett said at the time, which was pre-coronavirus pandemic. Trump's administration quick to cast blame on antifa amid protests U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Sunday also blamed antifa and other similar groups over the violent protests around the country. Barr did not say what specific groups may have been involved or where they came from, but he said the Justice Department and the FBI will work on identifying “criminal organizers and instigators” to be arrested and charged Trump's national security advisor Robert O'Brien told CNN Sunday that the administration planned to ""get to the bottom"" of antifa's role in the protests. And he said the president and Barr want to know what the FBI is doing to ""to track and dismantle and surveil and prosecute antifa."" O'Brien denounced ""these antifa militant radicals who come into our cities and cross state lines. ""They're organized, and use Molotov cocktails and fireworks and gas to burn down our cities, especially businesses in minority neighborhoods. It's got to be stopped,"" he said on ""State of the Union."" But some have blamed right-wing provocateurs seeking to incite a race war for the violence. ""The truth is nobody really knows,"" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Sunday on NBC News' ""Meet the Press."" ""What the exact political motivation is is unclear at this point. We need to investigate it,"" Ellison said. USA Today and Adam Tamburin contributed to this report. Reach Natalie Allison at nallison@tennessean.com. Follow her on Twitter at @natalie_allison.

Video footage from the Central Precinct and the Metro Courthouse in downtown Nashville showed isolated agitators leading the violence, destruction and arson. Photos and video from the Nashvilleprotest showed people dressed in all black with backpacks moving through the crowd that gathered to protest the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes. Other photos show unidentified individuals breaking windows and starting fires inside the Metro Courthouse. Many of the people seen vandalizing buildings appeared to be white.

(Photo: Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean) Anderson said police detectives were working to identify the people they believed to be insurgents. Police are establishing a dedicated email to collect tips about the protest. People can send information, photos and videos to NashvilleArsonInvestigation2020@nashville.gov. Anderson did not know if any of the isolated agitators were among the 28 people arrested during and after the protest. Most of the people taken into custody Saturday were charged with relatively minor misdemeanor violations such as disorderly conduct. None are charged in connection with the arson at the courthouse. Eleven of the arrestees were white. Sixteen were black. Three had out-of-state addresses, according to police. Gov. Bill Lee on Sunday said state authorities had ""reason to believe that many of those involved in unlawful acts are not Tennesseans."" The state Department of Safety and Homeland Security is launching an investigation into the matter along with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and other agencies. President Donald Trump on Sunday connected left-wing activist movement antifa with violence overtaking protests in multiple cities. In a tweet, he said the United States government would label the group a terrorist organization. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is active globally, including in Tennessee. The loosely affiliated groups frequently advocate for anti-racist policies, though often via an anarchist and militant approach. The police chief did not say if organized groups might have been behind the violence in Nashville. Spokesman Don Aaron said police suspected antifa and white supremacist groups could have been involved, although he said it was too soon to know for sure. Local prosecutors are working with police as the investigation moves forward. “We have a lot of work to do to identify individuals and determine their motives,” Nashville District Attorney Glenn Funk said. “Arson is a very serious crime.” Police also are collaborating with federal authorities as they continue to investigate. U.S. Attorney Don Cochran, who handles federal prosecutions in Middle Tennessee, met with officers Saturday. The feds are focusing on anyone who might have crossed state lines to participate in violent protests. Demonstration mirrored peaceful protests for most of the day Nashville, a hub of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, has seen a wave of protests over the past few years as activists spoke out against police officers killing black people — nationwide and here at home. Anderson said much of Saturday's demonstration, which began with a rally at Legislative Plaza and continued with a march through the city, mirrored peaceful Black Lives Matter protests in the past. Protesters have called police violence an outgrowth of systemic racism embedded in many facets of policing and American life. When protesters took to Nashville streets in 2014 after a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, local police officers handed out hot chocolate and set up rolling roadblocks. Protests bubbled up again in 2018 after white Nashville police officer Andrew Delke, 26, shot and killed Daniel Hambrick, who was black, as he was running away during a foot pursuit. Those protests remained largely peaceful. “Every previous march we’ve had, for the very most part, was people trying to express their thoughts, their ideas,” Anderson said. “That’s exactly what they did yesterday. But there was an element in the crowd that had other thoughts in mind."" Protesters stand in Legislative Plaza in Nashville, Tenn., Saturday, May 30, 2020 for the “I Will Breathe” rally to protest the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after being pinned down by a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day. (Photo: Larry McCormack/ The Tennessean) When chaos erupted, Anderson said, “only a small number were actually involved in defacing, setting fires, breaking windows or damaging cars.” “This was a peaceful gathering, a very peaceful march through downtown,"" Anderson said. “Then people within that group, using it as a cover, became the criminals that we’re seeking to identify at this point."" Lee called in the National Guard to assist police at Mayor John Cooper's request. State forces are expected to continue collaborating with local law enforcement moving forward. Anderson believed the ""attack on the courthouse,"" which included multiple fires, break-ins and vandalism, was premeditated. “That was a planned attack,” he said. “There was an organized effort and then they may have gathered up a following as they went along."" Police wearing riot gear lined the courthouse after fires became visible, lobbing cans of tear gas into the crowd and asking demonstrators to disperse. “It wasn’t until the arson attack on the courthouse that I authorized chemical spray,"" Anderson said. “When there’s a fire we've got to get the fire department in there and they’ve got to be safe.” Anderson said a heightened police presence would be planned downtown in the coming days. Activists at the heart of the peaceful rally and march said their message should not be lost while law enforcement pieces together the details of the day. They said the Community Oversight Board, a civilian panel that investigates allegations of police misconduct, should be further empowered to root out corruption in the police department. Organizers have criticized Anderson and the police department for failing to cooperate with the board. Progress will require more commitment to and investment in institutions focused on eliminating racism and discrimination at every level of government, said Jamel Campbell-Gooch, deputy director of the nonprofit Gideon’s Army and vice chair of the Community Oversight Board. “There are things we can be reaching for locally right now,” Campbell-Gooch said. “It’s time. All the changes they want to see needs to be invested by the mayor’s office to actually stop violence.” Yihyun Jeong and Natalie Allison contributed to this report.

Police said that protesters vandalized an armored vehicle and threw a brick through the window of Whiskey Dix, a local saloon. At one point, officers in gas masks fired tear gas to chase away protesters who were blocking an intersection by lying in the street, said Larry Flowers, a police spokesman. Mayor Shane McFarland enacted a 6:30 p.m. curfew to quell protests, but police struggled to enforce it. Gov.

The events that have happened are painful, but everyone was calm and peaceful as they conveyed their emotions,” Oppmann said. In downtown Murfreesboro, the meeting between police and protesters was not so amicable. A line of cops, some on horseback, advanced on protesters while threatening mass arrests for violating curfew. Crowds responded by screaming insults and curse words. At one point, officers could be seen tackling a young man of color as the crowd shouted and cars blared their horns in protest. Tempers flared, but the cops ultimately drove the protesters away by about 8:30 p.m., emptying the streets of downtown Murfreesboro.

(Photo: HELEN COMER/DNJ) The protests in Murfreesboro occurred alongside similar events in cities across the nation, many of which turned to riots and violence. Protests have been spurred by the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died as a police officer pinned him to the ground with a knee on the back of his neck. The killing inflamed long simmering fury over the deaths of people of color at the hands of police. On Saturday, a peaceful rally in Nashville descended into the violence and vandalism, culminating in a small group of rioters lighting a fire inside City Hall. The protests in Murfreesboro began with a peaceful vigil in Public Square intended to honor Floyd’s memory. The event initially drew just 100 people, but quickly grew to fill the square. “Our community has come together in ways I never imagined to stand in solidarity against injustice and overstep of police power,"" said Mike McDougal, the vigil organizer, during the event.

What carried forth as peaceful demonstrations by day turned destructive in some communities after dark. City sites scorched by arson, historic buildings marred by graffiti and a state of emergency declared by city leaders in response to the unrest. It has left communities across Tennessee shaken, and as tensions mount, it's unclear what's to come. What is certain is residents statewide joined together to scrub graffiti, board up broken windows and sweep shards of glass from the streets as activists and city leaders look for solutions. ""There's a historic anger, and there's an historic lack of trust in the community, and right now we need calm, compassionate leadership. We don't need confrontation,"" said Nashville business owner Tom Morales, who operates Acme Feed & Seed on Broadway where unrest erupted Saturday night. ""We cannot ignore what creates the problem. ... I think that a bunch of (instigators) hijacked a positive message."" Protests have rippled across the country decrying the brutal force used against George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer kept a knee pressed on his neck for more than eight minutes. Demonstrations came to Tennessee on Saturday as peaceful gatherings of hundreds and thousands took place in Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga and Jackson. Memphis staged its fourth day of protests. A peaceful protest in front of Jackson City Hall occurred Saturday, May 30, 2020 in the afternoon. The protestors helds signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and “I can’t breathe” after George Floyd's death May 25 in Minneapolis. (Photo: Stephanie Amador / The Jackson Sun) But as dusk fell, what had been nonviolent became tense. ""The threat to both peace and property is unacceptable and we will work with local law enforcement and community leaders to restore safety and order,"" Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee wrote on Twitter. ""This is not a reflection of our state or the fundamental American right to peaceful protest."" Unrest in Memphis, Chattanooga and Knoxville In Memphis, about two hours after a demonstration against police brutality ended peacefully Saturday, a chaotic few seconds changed the tone. In a dramatic standoff, some people who remained in the crowd of about 60 demonstrators crossed a barricade near the Orpheum Theatre, which was set up to separate protesters from police. When they did, horses holding mounted officers spooked and shuffled. Barricades tumbled to the ground and people fell down. Police moved forward. Glass bottles flew through the air. The unrest marked a shift from the previous days — and that night's earlier events during which demonstrators marched and police largely let demonstrations play out on their own, without interference or arrests. Most of the crowd from Saturday's protest left around 9 p.m. from the National Civil Rights Museum, a short walk from Beale Street. But several dozen stayed. By 11:30 p.m., there were about 35 officers with riot shields, including one armed with a long gun, on the scene near the crowd. stand (Photo: Joe Rondone) A key leader of the earlier protest, DeVante Hill, commented on Twitter: ""Tonight just when I thought things were over and we could successfully say we had a peaceful protest, there were young men and women who staggered around near Beale and Main. MPD definitely (incited) them with riot gear, horses and AR-15s ..."" ""I really believe we can do this. I truly believe we can do this another way. A crowd of 30 staggering people met with intense force like that is just uneasy for not only me to understand but a group of my other white brothers and sisters present as well,"" Hill wrote. In Chattanooga on Saturday night, overturned trash cans littered the streets as protesters threw rocks and at least one firework, sending others scattering as it exploded. Groups of demonstrators crowded Market Street after midnight, and several arrests were made. A crowd moved quickly through Market Square in Knoxville late Saturday night, smashing windows and destroying planters. Two men were arrested in separate incidents, including a 20-year-old male with six handguns, two shotguns, two rifles and narcotics. In the unrest, activist and former Knoxville City Council candidate David Hayes said on social media that he was shot with pepper-filled balls by police while he was escorting young protesters. Nashville activist: 'The narrative is changing' Nashville, too, saw conflict and destruction erupt in the aftermath of a peaceful protest. The historic Metro Courthouse burned, flames swelling through the first-floor windows. Clouds of tear gas mushroomed across Public Square Plaza. Spray paint tagged the walls. And the granite plaque commemorating Diane Nash, a civil rights leader in Nashville, was broken to pieces — its shards used to shatter windows. It left a mark on a city already scarred by the decimation of deadly tornadoes and the forced isolation of a pandemic. An 8 p.m. curfew was put in place for Nashville on Sunday after Mayor John Cooper, who had earlier Saturday attended the ""I Will Breathe"" rally to decry police brutality, declared a state of emergency. The order came, even as more demonstrations, including a Sunday vigil honoring Floyd's memory prepared to begin in Murfreesboro. Late morning, several streets leading to the Public Square were blocked by dump trucks and garbage trucks as fencing was set up and business owners preemptively boarded up their windows. ""We felt comfortable and knew it would be peaceful,"" said Scarlett Murphy, who owns Domenico's deli with husband Jeff Murphy. ""Then we started getting texts and calls that the people who weren't involved in the peaceful part were also coming, so we decided it would be best to be safe than sorry."" At 3:30 p.m., Murfreesboro organizers led a prayer circle where a diverse crowd of approximately 300 people gathered. Attendees chanted, ""No justice, no peace,"" followed by ""No racist, no peace,"" before heading on a march around the square where they continued chanting as they walked.

The plaque was shattered and used to break the windows of the Metro Courthouse during the previous night’s protests Sunday, May 31, 2020. NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — Mayor John Cooper condemned the violence that escalated in downtown Nashville following a peaceful protest Saturday night. Cooper told News 2 that the Historic Courthouse in Nashville will be back online Monday morning following arsonists setting a fire inside and vandals covering the walls in graffiti. Cooper said, “It is heartbreaking what happened at the courthouse. One of the heartbreaking things is the windows were smashed out but what was used to smash out the windows was the famous Diane Nashe commemorative plaque that commemorated how Nashville, with such civility, hosted on that very spot the great moment of civil rights in the struggle which is the lunch counter integration.” Cooper said the incident was vandalism and arson, and has nothing to do with social justice. Earlier Saturday, a continued fight for equal justice sparked a rally at the Legislative Plaza. Activists, politicians, protesters, and Mayor Cooper himself were in attendance. Cooper told News 2 that he wanted to remind people to socially distance to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. “We need to come together as a community realizes that a relatively I believe in the end small group of determined opportunistic vandals hijacked what is a message that we all need to hear kind of all the time. Equal justice under law is hard and we have to recommit ourselves every few years to getting that done,” Cooper said. The original rally organizers said that when their protest ended, the riots began. Mayor Cooper said first responders did have a plan in place going into the event. “We were seeing a disciplined police department not responding to what could be viewed as provocation very beautifully. We were being a national lesson and uh, you know in the end I think we’re going to realize that we need more officers, more help from the state sooner but what we need is we need for the public and for the leaders of every community to disavow this kind of action,” Cooper said. Cooper said action distracted from the main goal of most people there. There will be a curfew Sunday night from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. tomorrow morning. The Mayor said they’ll keep The National Guard in place and all of their resources to help the people downtown feel safe.

""It seems like five or six officers jumped on top of her. It’s overly aggressive to me for one to jump on the one black female. Those officers just surrounded her on the ground. I don’t think it was handled well from what I saw on that tweet,"" Turner said. While some, such as Turner, criticized MPD's use of force, the police department said the donning of riot gear and heavy response to a Downtown confrontation that lasted from about 11 p.m. Saturday to almost 1 a.m. Sunday was necessary. MPD also said shots were fired at officers Downtown twice between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. MPD Director Mike Rallings also praised the peaceful protest that took place hours before the confrontation as ""powerful and had meaning."" The tweet Turner referenced was from Commercial Appeal reporter Desiree Stennett, who captured a woman, whom Turner identified as Victoria Jones, being detained by police. In the video, Jones is seen backing away from a marching line of law enforcement officers wearing riot gear. Law enforcement can be heard telling the crowd to move and seen pushing people back. Then a police officer is heard saying, ""Somebody get her. Somebody get the girl in the gray hoodie.” Jones then turns away from an outstretched arm of an officer and is knocked to the ground. Multiple officers jump on top of her. She tries to get to her feet and manages to get on her hands and knees and then is knocked to the ground again.

Some bottles and glass were thrown at police and at least one firework, though the MPD described it as more than one. Jones was charged with misdemeanor rioting, resisting official detention and disorderly conduct. She is the founder of The Collective, an arts nonprofit in Orange Mound that is dedicating to uplifting black artists and encouraging them to be change-agents in Memphis. Both Turner and Sawyer described her as a personal friend. In a statement, Rallings said law enforcement donned riot gear to protect themselves and residents. He did not address the video of Jones' arrest, but drew a distinction between the confrontation and the peaceful protest against police brutality hundreds that took place earlier on Saturday evening. “Some have asked why our officers were wearing riot gear protection. I feel that this question is asked because some do not know all of the details. Clearly, you can see that our officers were wearing riot gear protection to protect themselves and so that they can protect our citizens. I have said that we support peaceful protest, but we will not stand by and let the few that want to wreak havoc tear down our city,” said Rallings. He said, ""The peaceful protest that took place earlier in the day was powerful and had meaning. The riot that occurred later in the downtown area only brought chaos and civil unrest. My hat goes off to those who seek justice through peaceful protest; they have meaning, heart, and purpose.” Buy Photo The fourth night of demonstrations in Memphis, Tenn., on Saturday, May 30, 2020, saw protesters face off with police in riot gear near the Orpheum on South Main Street.

Jones' arrest comes just days after a Memphis police officer knocked a woman over with a riot shield during a protest on Union Avenue in Midtown Memphis. On Friday, Strickland called for an investigation into that incident. The events have unfolded against the back-drop of nationwide protests against police brutality following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis Monday. Four nights of protests in Memphis, including Saturday night, have been largely peaceful and much more orderly than what has been seen in Nashville, Minneapolis, Oakland and other cities. The Sunday morning confrontation between law enforcement and the crowd appeared to be separate and distinct from the earlier protest.

(WKRN) — Governor Bill Lee said the Tennessee National Guard will remain mobilized across the state and multiple state agencies will begin investigating “unlawful incidents that occurred overnight.” “The right to peaceful protest is foundational to our country, but the violence and vandalism that occurred in Nashville last night was unlawful and tears at the fabric of our community,” said Gov. Lee. “We have reason to believe that many of those involved in unlawful acts are not Tennesseans and we will be working with law enforcement to investigate this further and bring those responsible to justice.” Personnel with the National Guard are mobilized to assist state and local law enforcement, standing by to ensure order and safety are maintained in the supported areas for as long as is warranted. In addition to support from the Guard, Governor Lee has authorized the continuation of a curfew in Nashville and will support similar measures in other Tennessee cities as requested.

The most serious incidents occurred along Paulista Avenue in the heart of Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, where the pro-Bolsonaro forces demanded the “closure” of both Parliament and the Supreme Court and a “military intervention” but encountered a huge opposition group that had gathered for a protest “in defense of democracy.” Tensions rose among those aligning themselves with the “conservative values” proclaimed by the ultrarightist Bolsonaro as they confronted those demonstrating in favor of “democratic institutions” and against the “authoritarianism” they accuse the reserve army captain turned president, who was inaugurated in January 2019, of fomenting and pursuing. The pro-democracy forces carried signs to that effect and were joined by the fans of several soccer clubs. The demonstrations, convened in several cities around the country, come at a point where Brazil, with almost half a million confirmed coronavirus cases, finds itself in the No. 2 spot worldwide in terms of people infected with the virus and No. 4 in terms of deaths, with 28,834, according to the latest official tally. Although there were incidents in other cities like Rio de Janeiro, the most serious violence occurred in Sao Paulo and left a number of people injured, including a photographer from Agencia EFE, Spain’s international news agency, Fernando Bizerra, who was hit in the leg by splinters from a small noise-bomb. The day of protests amid the pandemic reflects the heightened temperature of the political debate in Brazil, turmoil whipped up by Bolsonaro and his followers with criticism of Parliament and the high court and heavy pressure against the quarantines of greater or lesser rigidity imposed by state governors and city mayors to try and limit the spread of the coronavirus and the sometimes deadly Covid-19 pneumonia often caused by it. Also on Sunday, in Brasilia Bolsonaro attended an event organized by his supporters at which there were also harsh words for Parliament and the Supreme Court and calls for a military intervention to impose “order and progress,” the slogan on the Brazilian flag. Bolsonaro made no remarks at the event, limiting himself to greeting and embracing many of those attending, lifting children in his arms and posing for selfies with the crowd, all without wearing a facemask, although doing so is obligatory for the general public in moving about the streets of the capital. After greeting his some 3,000 followers participating in the event, the president headed over to a group of mounted policemen, got into the saddle on one of the horses and took the horse through the crowd, after which the throng dispersed without any further incident. The demonstration came after, on Saturday night, a small group of ultrarightist activists who have been camping out for days in downtown Brasilia headed toward the Supreme Court building in a torchlit march. In a scenario evoking neo-Nazi memories, dressed in black and some wearing facemasks, the demonstrators chanted slogans against the high court, which they accused of “yielding to communist interests.” Bolsonaro and three of his sons who are active in politics are currently being investigated in several probes being pursued by the Attorney General’s Office and supervised by the Supreme Court. The president is suspected of trying to illegally intervene in the Federal Police, an autonomous entity that is under the authority of the Ministry of Justice, the former head of which, Sergio Moro, has denounced those alleged irregularities. On Saturday, Bolsonaro posted a series of messages on the social networks alluding to the problems his administration is having with the judiciary and complained – as he has been doing almost daily – about the treatment that the press, exclusively “leftist” in his opinion, is giving to the investigations that have tainted him, his sons and several allies. Bolsonaro concluded his chain of online messages with the blunt phrase “Everything is pointing toward a crisis.” EFE",0.0
1621781599,2020-05-31 15:35:31,College Football Hall of Fame damaged in Atlanta protests,https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/sports/20200531/college-football-hall-of-fame-damaged-in-atlanta-protests?rssfeed=true,en,False,,106478,columbiadailyherald.com,http://columbiadailyherald.com/,"ATLANTA — The College Football Hall of Fame is boarded up and assessing damage from a destructive night of protests in downtown Atlanta. The facility’s most valuable trophies and artifacts were moved to a secure facility in case additional trouble breaks out amid nationwide unrest over the death in Minneapolis of a handcuffed black man who pleaded to police that he could not breathe. Kimberly Beaudin, the hall’s chief executive director, said Sunday that the extensive glass facade of the nearly 95,000-square-foot building was shattered Friday night. Rioters also broke into the street-level gift shop, stole merchandise and left it “pretty trashed,” she added. But, other than some broken glass that fell into a large exhibition area shaped like a football field, the interior of the hall was not breached by the protesters. “All of it can repaired. All of it can be recovered. All of the merchandise can be replaced,” Beaudin told The Associated Press. “We’re very thankful.” Previously located in South Bend, Indiana, the Hall of Fame opened a new $68.5 million facility in Atlanta in 2014, taking a prime spot adjacent to the Georgia World Congress Center and right across the street from Centennial Olympic Park. It is part of a hub of downtown tourist attractions that also includes the Georgia Aquarium, the World of Coca-Cola, CNN Center, the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, and a giant Ferris wheel. That area became the epicenter of Atlanta’s protests over the death of George Floyd. Thousands of people jammed the streets, clashing with police and damaging businesses. The Hall of Fame had been making plans to reopen after shutting down in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Beaudin said those plans likely will be pushed back because of the time needed to make repairs. “We had been working through scenario A and scenario B,” she said. “Now, we have scenario C.” More protests were staged Saturday in Atlanta, but no additional damage was reported to the Hall of Fame or other businesses around Centennial Olympic Park. The city was under a curfew and a heavy presence of police and National Guard soldiers curtailed a repeat of Friday night’s carnage. Beaudin and other Hall of Fame officials surveyed the damage Saturday morning and were heartened to be joined by dozens of fellow citizens who turned up with brooms and trash bags to help clean up the debris. The front of the facility was hastily boarded up and the collection of historic items — including a Heisman Trophy, a national championship trophy and countless other items documenting the history of college football — were removed from the hall. “We very much wanted to get our eyes on everything,” Beaudin said. “We took the extra precaution to … move all the valuable artifacts, the trophies and everything else. We wanted to take an abundance of caution, so we moved them off site to a secure facility. There are some iconic items. We don’t want them falling into the wrong hands.” In addition to welcoming thousands of visitors each year, the Hall of Fame hosts college football’s annual awards night and other events such as the Southeastern Conference media days. The SEC was set to host its preseason media function at the hall for the second time in mid-July, though those plans are up in the air because of the pandemic. If the league decides to stage the event in Atlanta, rather that holding it virtually, the Hall of Fame will have enough time to make repairs, Beaudin said. “We will be full prepared to host that event if the SEC decides to move forward with it,” she said.",0.0

And it’s not just in the U.S. — London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday that certainly violated government social distancing rules. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms warned that “there is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. Violent protests over the death of George Floyd by police have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some protests have turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. City officials ordered overnight curfews to quell the violence. Floyd, a black man, died May 25 in Minneapolis saying “I can’t breathe” after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck. It was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in America. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. “Whether they’re fired up or not, that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd’s death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting “No justice! No peace!” while carrying signs reading “Justice for George Floyd” and “Racism is a global issue.” Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close. The area has reported more nearly 2,500 infections and hospitals are reaching their limits. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Sunday that he would ask Parliament for a final two-week extension of the nation’s state of emergency that is set to expire on June 7. That allows the government to keep ordering lockdown measures to control its coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 27,000 lives, many of them in overwhelmed nursing homes. “We have almost reached safe harbor,” Sánchez said. Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. But England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation remained precarious even before Sunday’s protest in London. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States, and the Conservative government has been criticized for being to slow to react to the crisis. “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment,” he said. “We have to get this right.” At the Vatican, Pope Francis cautioned people against being pessimistic as they emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that “nothing will return as before.” That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that “the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.”",0.0

The chaos reached into every corner of the country, and the scars extended even to buildings near the White House. Some elected officials prepared to deploy additional National Guard troops in anticipation of more turmoil. Tens of thousands of people marched peacefully to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. But many demonstrations sank into violence as night fell: Cars and stores were torched. The words “I can’t breathe” were spray-painted all over buildings. Police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. The scale of the protests, including nearly every part of the country and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam eras. And by Sunday morning, the fury had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington, D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” People set fire to squad cars, threw bottles at officers and broke storefront windows. They carried away TVs and other merchandise even as some protesters urged them to stop. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead after multiple shootings that happened during downtown violence. Those slayings added to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up the demonstrations. The show of force came after three days in which police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured more than 4,000 National Guard troops into Minneapolis. Authorities said that number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. President Donald Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis and declaring “No games!” He said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a late-night statement. On Sunday, maintenance crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump and anti-police sentiments. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. County Commissioner Angela Conley showed up shortly after the curfew lifted, saying that police had trampled flowers and photos of Floyd. “The community needs healing, and what happened last night only exacerbated the pain that’s been felt,” she said of police action. Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who put his knee on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. “We’ll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,” Conley said. Meanwhile, a church located at the intersection set up chairs for an outdoor service. Tracy Gordon, of the Worldwide Outreach for Christ, said it was important “to bring some hope to the community and let everyone know that God is in control.” Few parts of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia , and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Some leaders prepared to put more soldiers in the streets by evening. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to Athens, Savannah and any other cities where more demonstrations were planned. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. “The protesters need to know we’re going to support their efforts in a peaceful, nonviolent protest,” the Republican told television station WSB late Saturday. “The agitators need to know that we’ll be there … to take them to jail if they’re destroying lives and property.” In Virginia’s capital city, graffiti invoking Floyd or directing slurs at the police dotted downtown, including many of Richmond’s some prominent Confederate monuments. At the headquarters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which news outlets reported was vandalized and set ablaze, a few men with long guns were among a small crowd gathered outside. One man said they were there to protect the building. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, six officers were hurt after being hit with rocks and fireworks. Police have arrested nearly 1,700 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.",0.0

Trent Ogilvie, a founding member of the Stand Together Fellowship, an organization spearheaded by local pastors and civic leaders who stand for the purpose of a united voice against racism and division, took to social media on Sunday morning. “Today, I pray that our worship would not be about what we want, but what God wants,” Ogilvie said in a statement shared on Sunday morning. “God created us to love and to be loved unconditionally, not to choose sides. I believe that every disciple of Jesus Christ has the power to transform our community, nation, and world by loving God and loving your neighbor. It is also described as just mercy. We need it now more than ever to combat all the forces of hate, evil, discrimination and injustice within our land today. I don't have all the answers, but I can start with the question in my own heart this Sunday morning.” A leader at Columbia's Bethel Chapel African American Methodist Church, Ogilvie offered insight through faith. “Today, based on culture and preference we selectively choose who to love and choose to worship with people we feel love us,” Ogilvie said. “It gives a sense of power. This is where the segregation comes in. The evil systems of racism, injustice, and hatred are also built on love and power, but not God's love and power. When individuals choose to love money, power, race, heritage or even country more than God's love it leads to destruction of people who God loves. Unfortunately, this is still the most segregated day in America. The segregation did not start this week. It has always existed. The reason for this segregation is complex, but also simple.” Ogilvie serves as the chief executive officer of the Columbia Housing and Redevelopment Corporation. In 2018, he served as chairman of the Maury County Chamber & Economic Alliance. “It's Sunday morning and God has blessed everyone … with another day of life, purpose, and power,” Ogilvie said. “The greatest commandment given to all worshipers irrespective of color is to love God with all of your heart, mind, soul, and strength. And love your neighbor as you love yourself. This morning I ask that you pause and ask God, am I worshiping you the way that you choose to be worshiped? Why do I worship with this group of people and not others? What does this reveal about me?” The Stand Together Fellowship continues to hold monthly meetings for ongoing discussions with Columbia's elected officials, law enforcement and the greater community continuing its work finding solutions through a collective focus, concentrating on education and the criminal justice system. The group was formed in the wake of the June shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S. C. In Columbia, a prayer vigil led by religious leaders of multiple backgrounds was held at St. Paul's African Methodist Episcopal Church. The group maintains a relationship with the Columbia Police Department, the Maury County Sheriff's Department, with Sheriff Bucky Rowland serving as another active member of the organization. The group is also actively involved with local county and city governments. Former Maury County Mayor Charlie Norman is another founding member of the group. Other community leaders spoke of the ongoing tension during local services on Sunday. Elder James Gavin at Columbia's New Life Church of God In Christ offered a message of love. “I would be remiss not to acknowledge what is happening,” Gavin said. “We are not as loving as we used to. We have to love our brothers and our sisters. We have to love one another. “It is time to wake up and stay awoke,” he continued. “People are dying. People are hurt. We are distracted. We need to come to a palace where we see God and God only. The racists, we need to pray for them. The ones that do us wrong. We need to make sure our holiness is still right. We need to walk this thing out. Don't let it distract you from what God is preparing.” Gavin told members of the congregation that now is a time for prayer not fighting. “Let's watch and be sober,” Gavin said. “We kill people when we are not sober.” Russ Adcox, the pastor at Columbia and Spring Hill's Maury Hills Church and a fellow prominent member of the Stand Together Fellowship welcomed members of the congregation back into the pews of the church for the first time since the coronavirus took hold of the state in March. “The conversations and actions of this group are more critical than ever,” Adcox said of the fellowship. “People are frustrated and emotionally exhausted (and rightfully so).” The group plans to resume its in-person meetings on Friday, June 5. “Tornadoes, pandemic closures, and riots are testing the resolve of honest, hard working, law abiding Tennesseans so far this year, and we will not be defeated,” said U.S. Rep. Scott DesJarlais, R-Tenn., on Sunday. DesJarlais represents the state's 4th Congressional District including portions of Maury County and 15 others across Middle and East Tennessee. Maury County Mayor Andy Ogles said he was praying for peace on Saturday afternoon and celebrating the peaceful demonstration that was held on the steps of the Maury County Courthouse earlier that morning. “I appreciate you for setting the example for our community,” Ogles said. “Encouraging a peaceful resolution to these types of race tensions that we have in our community.

Here's what we know about their Tennessee activities.,http://rssfeeds.dnj.com/~/625702726/0/murfreesboro/home~President-Trump-wants-to-declare-antifa-a-terrorist-group-Heres-what-we-know-about-their-Tennessee-activities/,en,False,,90683,dnj.com,http://www.dnj.com/#spider,"President Donald Trump has announced he intends to designate a militant anti-racist movement a terrorist organization as violent protests attended by a variety of activists have erupted in cities around the country, including Nashville. The protests, some of which have resulted in destruction of property and violent clashes with police, are being held in response to police killing George Floyd in Minneapolis and other black individuals who have recently died at the hands of law enforcement. ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,"" Trump said during remarks at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday, though it's unclear by what legal mechanism he can designate a domestic organization to be a terrorist group. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a left-wing activist movement active globally, including in Tennessee. The loosely affiliated groups frequently advocate for anti-racist policies, though often take an anarchist and militant approach. There is no formal leadership or unified national structure to the movement. It is not one organization, but rather loose network of activists using a ""black bloc"" tactic at protests — dressing in all black and concealing their faces with masks and bandannas. Multiple antifa groups have been based in Nashville in recent years. No clear evidence antifa organized violent protests in Nashville While many of the protesters in Nashville on Saturday fit that description, it's unclear if any affiliate with antifa organizations. Metro Nashville Police Department Chief Steve Anderson said Sunday the city is investigating a small group of people they believe used the protest as a cover for violence and other criminal acts. The police chief did not say if any organized groups might be behind the violence in Nashville. A peaceful rally held downtown Saturday afternoon evolved throughout the evening, eventually turning from a march into a chaotic eruption of vandalism to public and private property. Metro Nashville's historic courthouse and city hall were set afire in the process, among other significant damage the building sustained. Antifa groups have, however, openly mobilized overwhelmingly nonviolent counterprotests at events like the October 2017 ""White Lives Matter Rally"" in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro, as well as made appearances at the annual American Renaissance conference held at Tennessee's Montgomery Bell State Park. The conference, which was canceled this year due to the coronavirus and therefore did not prompt a protest, is held by a white nationalist organization. The protest groups are typically met with a large number of park rangers and forced to demonstrate behind barriers, limiting the possibility for physical confrontations with the conference-goers. While some small altercations have taken place between protesters and counterprotesters at those events, there is no evidence that antifa activists have been responsible for inciting any type of significant violence in Tennessee. They frequently inhabit a very insular online space, trading jabs with individuals they believe to espouse white supremacist beliefs. As with other antifa activists around the nation, Jam City Antifa, a Nashville-based network, has been known to track area white supremacists and post photos and other identifying information about them online, sometimes encouraging followers to show up to heckle them at events. White supremacists have in turn done the same for antifa activists in the area. Last year, U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Knoxville, filed the ""Unmasking Antifa Act,"" legislation that sought to punish up to 15 years a person wearing a mask or disguise while committing a crime, including threatening or intimidating another individual ""exercising their constitutional rights or privileges,"" according to a statement from Burchett's office at the time. ""It’s time we get tough on this issue. These cowards wouldn’t act the way they do if the whole world could see their faces,” Burchett said at the time, which was pre-coronavirus pandemic. Trump's administration quick to cast blame on antifa amid protests U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Sunday also blamed antifa and other similar groups over the violent protests around the country. Barr did not say what specific groups may have been involved or where they came from, but he said the Justice Department and the FBI will work on identifying “criminal organizers and instigators” to be arrested and charged Trump's national security advisor Robert O'Brien told CNN Sunday that the administration planned to ""get to the bottom"" of antifa's role in the protests. And he said the president and Barr want to know what the FBI is doing to ""to track and dismantle and surveil and prosecute antifa."" O'Brien denounced ""these antifa militant radicals who come into our cities and cross state lines. ""They're organized, and use Molotov cocktails and fireworks and gas to burn down our cities, especially businesses in minority neighborhoods. It's got to be stopped,"" he said on ""State of the Union."" But some have blamed right-wing provocateurs seeking to incite a race war for the violence. ""The truth is nobody really knows,"" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Sunday on NBC News' ""Meet the Press."" ""What the exact political motivation is is unclear at this point. We need to investigate it,"" Ellison said. USA Today and Adam Tamburin contributed to this report. Reach Natalie Allison at nallison@tennessean.com. Follow her on Twitter at @natalie_allison.

1621795413,2020-05-31 17:19:28,"In Tennessee, peaceful demonstrations by day turned destructive after dark",http://rssfeeds.dnj.com/~/625705564/0/murfreesboro/home~In-Tennessee-peaceful-demonstrations-by-day-turned-destructive-after-dark/,en,False,,90683,dnj.com,http://www.dnj.com/#spider,"Thousands in Tennessee massed to protest against police brutality. What carried forth as peaceful demonstrations by day turned destructive in some communities after dark. City sites scorched by arson, historic buildings marred by graffiti and a state of emergency declared by city leaders in response to the unrest. It has left communities across Tennessee shaken, and as tensions mount, it's unclear what's to come. What is certain is residents statewide joined together to scrub graffiti, board up broken windows and sweep shards of glass from the streets as activists and city leaders look for solutions. ""There's a historic anger, and there's an historic lack of trust in the community, and right now we need calm, compassionate leadership. We don't need confrontation,"" said Nashville business owner Tom Morales, who operates Acme Feed & Seed on Broadway where unrest erupted Saturday night. ""We cannot ignore what creates the problem. ... I think that a bunch of (instigators) hijacked a positive message."" Protests have rippled across the country decrying the brutal force used against George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer kept a knee pressed on his neck for more than eight minutes. Demonstrations came to Tennessee on Saturday as peaceful gatherings of hundreds and thousands took place in Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga and Jackson. Memphis staged its fourth day of protests. A peaceful protest in front of Jackson City Hall occurred Saturday, May 30, 2020 in the afternoon. The protestors helds signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and “I can’t breathe” after George Floyd's death May 25 in Minneapolis. (Photo: Stephanie Amador / The Jackson Sun) But as dusk fell, what had been nonviolent became tense. ""The threat to both peace and property is unacceptable and we will work with local law enforcement and community leaders to restore safety and order,"" Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee wrote on Twitter. ""This is not a reflection of our state or the fundamental American right to peaceful protest."" Unrest in Memphis, Chattanooga and Knoxville In Memphis, about two hours after a demonstration against police brutality ended peacefully Saturday, a chaotic few seconds changed the tone. In a dramatic standoff, some people who remained in the crowd of about 60 demonstrators crossed a barricade near the Orpheum Theatre, which was set up to separate protesters from police. When they did, horses holding mounted officers spooked and shuffled. Barricades tumbled to the ground and people fell down. Police moved forward. Glass bottles flew through the air. The unrest marked a shift from the previous days — and that night's earlier events during which demonstrators marched and police largely let demonstrations play out on their own, without interference or arrests. Most of the crowd from Saturday's protest left around 9 p.m. from the National Civil Rights Museum, a short walk from Beale Street. But several dozen stayed. By 11:30 p.m., there were about 35 officers with riot shields, including one armed with a long gun, on the scene near the crowd. stand (Photo: Joe Rondone) A key leader of the earlier protest, DeVante Hill, commented on Twitter: ""Tonight just when I thought things were over and we could successfully say we had a peaceful protest, there were young men and women who staggered around near Beale and Main. MPD definitely (incited) them with riot gear, horses and AR-15s ..."" ""I really believe we can do this. I truly believe we can do this another way. A crowd of 30 staggering people met with intense force like that is just uneasy for not only me to understand but a group of my other white brothers and sisters present as well,"" Hill wrote. In Chattanooga on Saturday night, overturned trash cans littered the streets as protesters threw rocks and at least one firework, sending others scattering as it exploded. Groups of demonstrators crowded Market Street after midnight, and several arrests were made. A crowd moved quickly through Market Square in Knoxville late Saturday night, smashing windows and destroying planters. Two men were arrested in separate incidents, including a 20-year-old male with six handguns, two shotguns, two rifles and narcotics. In the unrest, activist and former Knoxville City Council candidate David Hayes said on social media that he was shot with pepper-filled balls by police while he was escorting young protesters. Nashville activist: 'The narrative is changing' Nashville, too, saw conflict and destruction erupt in the aftermath of a peaceful protest. The historic Metro Courthouse burned, flames swelling through the first-floor windows. Clouds of tear gas mushroomed across Public Square Plaza. Spray paint tagged the walls. And the granite plaque commemorating Diane Nash, a civil rights leader in Nashville, was broken to pieces — its shards used to shatter windows. It left a mark on a city already scarred by the decimation of deadly tornadoes and the forced isolation of a pandemic. An 8 p.m. curfew was put in place for Nashville on Sunday after Mayor John Cooper, who had earlier Saturday attended the ""I Will Breathe"" rally to decry police brutality, declared a state of emergency. The order came, even as more demonstrations, including a Sunday vigil honoring Floyd's memory prepared to begin in Murfreesboro. Late morning, several streets leading to the Public Square were blocked by dump trucks and garbage trucks as fencing was set up and business owners preemptively boarded up their windows. ""We felt comfortable and knew it would be peaceful,"" said Scarlett Murphy, who owns Domenico's deli with husband Jeff Murphy. ""Then we started getting texts and calls that the people who weren't involved in the peaceful part were also coming, so we decided it would be best to be safe than sorry."" At 3:30 p.m., Murfreesboro organizers led a prayer circle where a diverse crowd of approximately 300 people gathered. Attendees chanted, ""No justice, no peace,"" followed by ""No racist, no peace,"" before heading on a march around the square where they continued chanting as they walked. Nashville Mayor John Cooper moves through the crowd gathered Saturday, May 30, 2020, for the “I Will Breathe” rally to protest the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after being pinned down by a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day. (Photo: Larry McCormack/ The Tennessean) As she reflected on the weekend's events, Odessa Kelly, executive director of activist group Stand Up Nashville, said: ""I'm irritated about how the narrative is changing to how people are protesting to what the real problem is."" ""Rioting is the language of people who feel their voices are never heard. I'm tired of hearing peaceful protests. Do we want that to happen? Yes. But the crux of that is that we have a messed up system here. The police system needs to be fixed to not allow these atrocities to happen.""

1621795411,2020-05-31 17:19:54,Gov. Lee orders more National Guard members deployed across Tennessee to assist police,http://rssfeeds.dnj.com/~/625694590/0/murfreesboro/home~Gov-Lee-orders-more-National-Guard-members-deployed-across-Tennessee-to-assist-police/,en,False,,90683,dnj.com,http://www.dnj.com/#spider,"Faced with the possibility of additional violence, Gov. Bill Lee said Sunday he is increasing a deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to help with law enforcement, this time in all three divisions of the state. The governor made the announcement one day after 75 guardsmen were deployed in Nashville in response to an eruption of violence. The rancor occurred after a peaceful rally attended by thousands of Tennesseans who were protesting police brutality and racism. The governor did not say how many and exactly where the guardsmen will be deployed Sunday. Additionally, Lee announced a joint effort between the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement to investigate Saturday's violence in Nashville, which he said was provoked by many non-Tennesseans. “The right to peaceful protest is foundational to our country, but the violence and vandalism that occurred in Nashville last night was unlawful and tears at the fabric of our community,” Lee said in a statement. “We have reason to believe that many of those involved in unlawful acts are not Tennesseans and we will be working with law enforcement to investigate this further and bring those responsible to justice.” The violence occurred hours after thousands of people gathered near the Capitol for a peaceful rally, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Organizers of Saturday's rally urged participants to remain peaceful but violence later erupted throughout the city's downtown area, including windows being smashed and a fire being set at the city's historic Metro Courthouse, which includes city hall offices. In total, 28 Metro Nashville police arrested 28 people Saturday night, many after the 10 p.m. curfew. Of those, 21 are from Nashville, four from elsewhere in Tennessee and three from out of state: Texas, Illinois and New York. Saturday's deployment of the National Guard, which was aimed at providing assistance to the Tennessee Highway Patrol and Metro Police Department, was likely the first such move for law enforcement purposes in decades. The guardsmen first reported to the Capitol grounds, where a statue was toppled over. The troops later moved to Lower Broadway, to provide assistance after businesses were damaged.

(Photo: Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean) David Roberson, a spokesman for the Department of General Services, said the extent of damage to state-owned property included graffiti and broken windows and doors. Roberson said windows were broken at the War Memorial building, the Rachel Jackson and Andrew Jackson buildings and Citizens Plaza, where graffiti was also found. A door was broken at the state Supreme Court. Graffiti was found on the Capitol grounds, including on a wall. The toppled statue was to be removed Sunday. Roberson said there are no estimates of the total cost of the various damage to state-owned properties. Lee's deployment of the National Guard came at the request of Nashville Mayor John Cooper, said Laine Arnold, the governor's spokeswoman. The governor made the announcement shortly after 9 p.m. Lee signed an executive order, effectively affirming a 10 p.m. curfew Cooper implemented. ""I mobilized the National Guard to assist in protecting the lives and property of Tennesseans, which is a critical responsibility of government,"" the governor's executive order stated. The governor signed another executive order on Sunday to once again coincide with Nashville's latest curfew, which is set for 8 p.m. Tennessee's last major deployment of its National Guard for law enforcement purposes occurred in 1968, after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As many as 4,000 guardsmen were deployed in Nashville the day King was murdered, according to The Tennessean's archives. Troops were stationed throughout the city, including standing guard, complete with rifles and bayonets, outside the state Capitol. The National Guard was deployed throughout Nashville for several days after King's assassination. Guardsmen were also deployed in Memphis.

By 8:15 p.m. Saturday, flames could be seen shooting from a first-floor window of the Metro Nashville Courthouse and City Hall. That event led police to issue a 10 p.m. curfew, Mayor John Cooper to declare a state of civil emergency and Gov. Bill Lee to order the National Guard into the city. Multiple people were arrested before the curfew began. “After the arson and vandalism at the courthouse, this has taken on a much different response,” police spokesman Don Aaron said. “Those who continue to harm the city — those who continue to participate in this destruction — are being warned that they’re engaging in unlawful assembly and officers are prepared for arrests.” Police detained people on Broadway after 10 p.m. and urged people on the pedestrian bridge to leave downtown. The afternoon started with a large and peaceful rally at the Legislative Plaza, but problems began to emerge as demonstrators started to march. A little more than a mile from the Capitol, several people were arrested when windows were smashed in a Metro Nashville police cruiser near Sixth Avenue South and Korean Veterans Boulevard; some protesters later threw rocks and bottles at officers. ""It's a mess right now,"" Nashville police central precinct commander Gordon Howey said late Saturday afternoon. About 90 minutes after that first violent confrontation, a handful of protesters had made their way to Nashville's Metro Courthouse and City Hall where some were throwing rocks and smashing windows on the building. Police met those protesters with force but dozens of other demonstrators arrived a short time later; officers under a barrage of rocks and bottles, in the shadow of City Hall, sprayed pepper spray in an attempt to gain control of the situation. Demonstrators smash a Metro Nashville Police car outside Central Precinct in Nashville, Tenn., Saturday, May 30, 2020 after the “I Will Breathe” rally to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being pinned down by a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day. (Photo: Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean) Organizers of the rally released a statement late Saturday night condemning the violence. “Our organization, in cooperation with other activists, held a peaceful rally today to protest the murder of Minneapolis resident George Floyd by police as well as to deliver a clear message to Metro and state government leaders that Tennesseans deeply oppose racism and police brutality. The event drew some 4,000 attendees and our staff registered over 300 new voters. It was a peaceful assembly,"" said Charlane Oliver and Tequila Johnson in a statement attributed to the founders and executive directors of The Equity Alliance “It is our firm belief that those individuals defacing and destroying public property after the rally were not a part of the original event. The actions by this small group reflect neither the beliefs of the groups that led today’s peaceful assembly nor those of the majority of the attendees. This behavior dishonors the memory of George Floyd and other black Americans that have died unjustly at the hands of police."" PROTEST UPDATES: Protesters marching in downtown Nashville; multiple arrests made The rally began at the Legislative Plaza about 3 p.m. Saturday where several thousand people gathered for a demonstration that included lawmakers and community leaders speaking at the event. Nashville Mayor John Cooper was among them and he encouraged members of the city council to join him. The mayor said it was ""an especially critical time for all of us, as Metro’s leaders, to show up and listen to black voices speaking out from across Davidson County.""

It was a little more than a mile to the south of the Legislative Plaza where the first violent clashes occurred. Protesters bashed in the windows of a police cruiser outside the police department's Central Precinct at Sixth Avenue and Korean Veterans Boulevard. By about 6 p.m. Saturday, a series of officers in riot gear with masks, helmets and batons arrived at the precinct. A crowd converged around them and few plastic water bottles flew toward the officers. Officers on horseback soon followed and some in the crowd threw rocks and water bottles toward the officers. The crowd moved down Broadway and through Nashville's popular honky tonk district, with some vandalizing buildings along the way, including Bridgestone Arena. By 7 p.m., a small group of protesters had arrived at City Hall where some were smashing the building's windows with rocks and other items. Tension near City Hall abated for a while, with protesters and officers talking while police held a line. By 8 p.m., a statue outside the state Capital of controversial lawmaker and newspaper publisher Edward Carmack had been torn down.

A short time later, police with riot gear arrived as a fire burned inside a window at city hall. Officers deployed tear gas as rioters clustered in the center of public square park. ""This afternoon’s rally for George Floyd and racial justice was peaceful. I attended and listened,"" Cooper said on Twitter at 8:22 p.m.. ""We cannot let today’s message of reform descend into further violence. If you mean our city harm, go home."" At 8:45 p.m., Cooper declared a civil state of emergency and police issued a 10 p.m. curfew. Shortly after 9 p.m. Lee said he was, at Cooper's request, authorizing the National Guard in response to the protests. ""The threat to both peace and property is unacceptable and we will work with local law enforcement and community leaders to restore safety and order,"" Lee tweeted. ""This is not a reflection of our state or the fundamental American right to peaceful protest."" As the curfew neared, police said anyone outside after 10 p.m. would be arrested.

Police said that protesters vandalized an armored vehicle and threw a brick through the window of Whiskey Dix, a local saloon. At one point, officers in gas masks fired tear gas to chase away protesters who were blocking an intersection by lying in the street, said Larry Flowers, a police spokesman. Mayor Shane McFarland enacted a 6:30 p.m. curfew to quell protests, but police struggled to enforce it. Gov.

The events that have happened are painful, but everyone was calm and peaceful as they conveyed their emotions,” Oppmann said. In downtown Murfreesboro, the meeting between police and protesters was not so amicable. A line of cops, some on horseback, advanced on protesters while threatening mass arrests for violating curfew. Crowds responded by screaming insults and curse words. At one point, officers could be seen tackling a young man of color as the crowd shouted and cars blared their horns in protest. Tempers flared, but the cops ultimately drove the protesters away by about 8:30 p.m., emptying the streets of downtown Murfreesboro.

Protests have been spurred by the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died as a police officer pinned him to the ground with a knee on the back of his neck. The killing inflamed long simmering fury over the deaths of people of color at the hands of police. On Saturday, a peaceful rally in Nashville descended into the violence and vandalism, culminating in a small group of rioters lighting a fire inside City Hall. The protests in Murfreesboro began with a peaceful vigil in Public Square intended to honor Floyd’s memory.

Floyd, a black man, was killed while in police custody on Memorial Day. Memphis experienced four straight nights of largely peaceful demonstrations before tensions escalated between a small group of mostly African-Americans and dozens of officers outfitted in riot gear. The confrontation, which included some bottles thrown at police and at least one firework, resulted in the arrests of five people. The second-year Tigers staff member took to social media Sunday to weigh in. “As a privileged white male working for, working with and coaching some of the most amazing and strong African American men it is absolutely heartbreaking to know the unconscionable inequality that still exists in our world,” Toppert’s statement reads. “As the brother-in-law of an African American deaf man and as the uncle of two African American young adults, I am truly scared for where we are as a society. “But rather than spend time feeling defeated, it is simply time to act, time to walk a path of togetherness, time to use daily actions to snuff out racism and create a world of true equality that will be the foundation for coming generations. We can create the world we want but it will only happen one act at a time. As the stonecutter’s credo says… . When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred-and-first blow, it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before. So now is the time to pick up our ‘hammers’ and pound the stone… .” Earlier this week, Memphis forward Lance Thomas spoke out on Twitter in response to Floyd's death. “Not even going to lie I’m never pledging allegiance to the American Flag before any of my games or anywhere I’m at ever again,"" Thomas wrote on Twitter, as read on air Thursday by Sports 56 radio host Peter Edmiston. ""I refuse to pledge allegiance to a country that practices killing black people for sport.” Thomas, a junior forward from Norcross, Georgia, who transferred from Louisville before the 2018-19 season, deleted the tweet on Wednesday. Later, he posted a tweet that read, ""made me take it down."" Thomas also tweeted an apology ""to anyone who took offense to my tweet ... "" On Thursday, Memphis athletics director Laird Veatch said he supports Thomas. ""I'm looking forward to having conversations with Penny (Hardaway) and possibly Lance directly about it,"" Veatch said. ""I certainly want to be supportive of, first of all, his right to free speech — but, also, the challenges he's going through.""

Police did not say that the shots fired incidents were tied to an earlier peaceful protest Downtown or confrontations between police and protesters near Beale Street after the protest. Martinease Jamison, 39, was arrested in connection to shots that were fired at police in downtown Memphis early Sunday. (Photo: Shelby County Sheriff's Department) MPD said Sunday afternoon that an individual driving near the intersection of Beale Street and Fourth Street fired shots at an officer around 2:30 a.m. The officer was not struck. Martinease Jamison, 39, was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon, intentionally evading arrest in an automobile and driving with a revoked or suspended license. He was booked into the Shelby County Jail shortly after noon on Sunday, according to jail records. According to an affidavit, officers were in the entertainment district checking to see if businesses had been vandalized when several vehicles turned eastbound onto Beale Street from Fourth Street. The occupants of the vehicles were shouting obscenities towards the officers. Jamison was driving westbound on Beale but then put his car in reverse and joined the caravan traveling eastbound. Jamison allegedly fired a shot from the vehicle and officers immediately pursued him onto Danny Thomas Boulevard and then onto Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, where a traffic stop was made, according to court documents. Police ordered Jamison to leave the vehicle and saw a black handgun between the driver's seat and the center console. A search warrant was later executed on the vehicle and police recovered a handgun with 15 live rounds in the magazine and one live round in the chamber, according to the affidavit. Jamison told police he did not fire the handgun. At 3:20 a.m., a different individual fired shots at an officer. The individual fled the scene and has not yet been arrested, MPD said.

The confrontation started about an hour after the dispersal of a peaceful protest and march through Downtown Memphis that drew about 500 people. Seven other people were arrested Sunday in connection with a confrontation between police and protesters, MPD said. Police released statements about the shots fired incidents and the protesters arrested in the same Facebook post, but none of the protesters have been connected with either shots fired incident.

Bill Lee announced that the Tennessee National Guard will remain mobilized across the state.

Lee. “We have reason to believe that many of those involved in unlawful acts are not Tennesseans and we will be working with law enforcement to investigate this further and bring those responsible to justice.” The release says the National Guard will be available to assist state and local law enforcement across all three Grand Divisions.

What carried forth as peaceful demonstrations by day turned destructive in some communities after dark. City sites scorched by arson, historic buildings marred by graffiti and a state of emergency declared by city leaders in response to the unrest. It has left communities across Tennessee shaken, and as tensions mount, it's unclear what's to come. What is certain is residents statewide joined together to scrub graffiti, board up broken windows and sweep shards of glass from the streets as activists and city leaders look for solutions. ""There's a historic anger, and there's an historic lack of trust in the community, and right now we need calm, compassionate leadership. We don't need confrontation,"" said Nashville business owner Tom Morales, who operates Acme Feed & Seed on Broadway where unrest erupted Saturday night. ""We cannot ignore what creates the problem. ... I think that a bunch of (instigators) hijacked a positive message."" Protests have rippled across the country decrying the brutal force used against George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer kept a knee pressed on his neck for more than eight minutes. Demonstrations came to Tennessee on Saturday as peaceful gatherings of hundreds and thousands took place in Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga and Jackson. Memphis staged its fourth day of protests. A peaceful protest in front of Jackson City Hall occurred Saturday, May 30, 2020 in the afternoon. The protestors helds signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and “I can’t breathe” after George Floyd's death May 25 in Minneapolis. (Photo: Stephanie Amador / The Jackson Sun) But as dusk fell, what had been nonviolent became tense. ""The threat to both peace and property is unacceptable and we will work with local law enforcement and community leaders to restore safety and order,"" Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee wrote on Twitter. ""This is not a reflection of our state or the fundamental American right to peaceful protest."" Unrest in Memphis, Chattanooga and Knoxville In Memphis, about two hours after a demonstration against police brutality ended peacefully Saturday, a chaotic few seconds changed the tone. In a dramatic standoff, some people who remained in the crowd of about 60 demonstrators crossed a barricade near the Orpheum Theatre, which was set up to separate protesters from police. When they did, horses holding mounted officers spooked and shuffled. Barricades tumbled to the ground and people fell down. Police moved forward. Glass bottles flew through the air. The unrest marked a shift from the previous days — and that night's earlier events during which demonstrators marched and police largely let demonstrations play out on their own, without interference or arrests. Most of the crowd from Saturday's protest left around 9 p.m. from the National Civil Rights Museum, a short walk from Beale Street. But several dozen stayed. By 11:30 p.m., there were about 35 officers with riot shields, including one armed with a long gun, on the scene near the crowd. stand (Photo: Joe Rondone) A key leader of the earlier protest, DeVante Hill, commented on Twitter: ""Tonight just when I thought things were over and we could successfully say we had a peaceful protest, there were young men and women who staggered around near Beale and Main. MPD definitely (incited) them with riot gear, horses and AR-15s ..."" ""I really believe we can do this. I truly believe we can do this another way. A crowd of 30 staggering people met with intense force like that is just uneasy for not only me to understand but a group of my other white brothers and sisters present as well,"" Hill wrote. In Chattanooga on Saturday night, overturned trash cans littered the streets as protesters threw rocks and at least one firework, sending others scattering as it exploded. Groups of demonstrators crowded Market Street after midnight, and several arrests were made. A crowd moved quickly through Market Square in Knoxville late Saturday night, smashing windows and destroying planters. Two men were arrested in separate incidents, including a 20-year-old male with six handguns, two shotguns, two rifles and narcotics. In the unrest, activist and former Knoxville City Council candidate David Hayes said on social media that he was shot with pepper-filled balls by police while he was escorting young protesters. Nashville activist: 'The narrative is changing' Nashville, too, saw conflict and destruction erupt in the aftermath of a peaceful protest. The historic Metro Courthouse burned, flames swelling through the first-floor windows. Clouds of tear gas mushroomed across Public Square Plaza. Spray paint tagged the walls. And the granite plaque commemorating Diane Nash, a civil rights leader in Nashville, was broken to pieces — its shards used to shatter windows. It left a mark on a city already scarred by the decimation of deadly tornadoes and the forced isolation of a pandemic. An 8 p.m. curfew was put in place for Nashville on Sunday after Mayor John Cooper, who had earlier Saturday attended the ""I Will Breathe"" rally to decry police brutality, declared a state of emergency. The order came, even as more demonstrations, including a Sunday vigil honoring Floyd's memory prepared to begin in Murfreesboro. Late morning, several streets leading to the Public Square were blocked by dump trucks and garbage trucks as fencing was set up and business owners preemptively boarded up their windows. ""We felt comfortable and knew it would be peaceful,"" said Scarlett Murphy, who owns Domenico's deli with husband Jeff Murphy. ""Then we started getting texts and calls that the people who weren't involved in the peaceful part were also coming, so we decided it would be best to be safe than sorry."" At 3:30 p.m., Murfreesboro organizers led a prayer circle where a diverse crowd of approximately 300 people gathered. Attendees chanted, ""No justice, no peace,"" followed by ""No racist, no peace,"" before heading on a march around the square where they continued chanting as they walked.

(Photo: Larry McCormack/ The Tennessean) As she reflected on the weekend's events, Odessa Kelly, executive director of activist group Stand Up Nashville, said: ""I'm irritated about how the narrative is changing to how people are protesting to what the real problem is."" ""Rioting is the language of people who feel their voices are never heard. I'm tired of hearing peaceful protests. Do we want that to happen? Yes. But the crux of that is that we have a messed up system here. The police system needs to be fixed to not allow these atrocities to happen.""

Lee orders more National Guard members deployed across Tennessee to assist police,http://rssfeeds.theleafchronicle.com/~/625694590/0/clarksville/home~Gov-Lee-orders-more-National-Guard-members-deployed-across-Tennessee-to-assist-police/,en,False,,143905,theleafchronicle.com,http://theleafchronicle.com/,"Faced with the possibility of additional violence, Gov. Bill Lee said Sunday he is increasing a deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to help with law enforcement, this time in all three divisions of the state. The governor made the announcement one day after 75 guardsmen were deployed in Nashville in response to an eruption of violence. The rancor occurred after a peaceful rally attended by thousands of Tennesseans who were protesting police brutality and racism. The governor did not say how many and exactly where the guardsmen will be deployed Sunday. Additionally, Lee announced a joint effort between the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement to investigate Saturday's violence in Nashville, which he said was provoked by many non-Tennesseans. “The right to peaceful protest is foundational to our country, but the violence and vandalism that occurred in Nashville last night was unlawful and tears at the fabric of our community,” Lee said in a statement. “We have reason to believe that many of those involved in unlawful acts are not Tennesseans and we will be working with law enforcement to investigate this further and bring those responsible to justice.” The violence occurred hours after thousands of people gathered near the Capitol for a peaceful rally, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Organizers of Saturday's rally urged participants to remain peaceful but violence later erupted throughout the city's downtown area, including windows being smashed and a fire being set at the city's historic Metro Courthouse, which includes city hall offices. In total, 28 Metro Nashville police arrested 28 people Saturday night, many after the 10 p.m. curfew. Of those, 21 are from Nashville, four from elsewhere in Tennessee and three from out of state: Texas, Illinois and New York. Saturday's deployment of the National Guard, which was aimed at providing assistance to the Tennessee Highway Patrol and Metro Police Department, was likely the first such move for law enforcement purposes in decades. The guardsmen first reported to the Capitol grounds, where a statue was toppled over. The troops later moved to Lower Broadway, to provide assistance after businesses were damaged.

(Photo: Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean) David Roberson, a spokesman for the Department of General Services, said the extent of damage to state-owned property included graffiti and broken windows and doors. Roberson said windows were broken at the War Memorial building, the Rachel Jackson and Andrew Jackson buildings and Citizens Plaza, where graffiti was also found. A door was broken at the state Supreme Court. Graffiti was found on the Capitol grounds, including on a wall. The toppled statue was to be removed Sunday. Roberson said there are no estimates of the total cost of the various damage to state-owned properties. Lee's deployment of the National Guard came at the request of Nashville Mayor John Cooper, said Laine Arnold, the governor's spokeswoman. The governor made the announcement shortly after 9 p.m. Lee signed an executive order, effectively affirming a 10 p.m. curfew Cooper implemented. ""I mobilized the National Guard to assist in protecting the lives and property of Tennesseans, which is a critical responsibility of government,"" the governor's executive order stated. The governor signed another executive order on Sunday to once again coincide with Nashville's latest curfew, which is set for 8 p.m. Tennessee's last major deployment of its National Guard for law enforcement purposes occurred in 1968, after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As many as 4,000 guardsmen were deployed in Nashville the day King was murdered, according to The Tennessean's archives. Troops were stationed throughout the city, including standing guard, complete with rifles and bayonets, outside the state Capitol. The National Guard was deployed throughout Nashville for several days after King's assassination. Guardsmen were also deployed in Memphis.

1621817051,2020-05-31 15:30:59,President Trump wants to declare antifa a terrorist group. Here's what we know about their Tennessee activities.,http://rssfeeds.theleafchronicle.com/~/625702726/0/clarksville/home~President-Trump-wants-to-declare-antifa-a-terrorist-group-Heres-what-we-know-about-their-Tennessee-activities/,en,False,,143905,theleafchronicle.com,http://theleafchronicle.com/,"President Donald Trump has announced he intends to designate a militant anti-racist movement a terrorist organization as violent protests attended by a variety of activists have erupted in cities around the country, including Nashville. The protests, some of which have resulted in destruction of property and violent clashes with police, are being held in response to police killing George Floyd in Minneapolis and other black individuals who have recently died at the hands of law enforcement. ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,"" Trump said during remarks at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday, though it's unclear by what legal mechanism he can designate a domestic organization to be a terrorist group. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a left-wing activist movement active globally, including in Tennessee. The loosely affiliated groups frequently advocate for anti-racist policies, though often take an anarchist and militant approach. There is no formal leadership or unified national structure to the movement. It is not one organization, but rather loose network of activists using a ""black bloc"" tactic at protests — dressing in all black and concealing their faces with masks and bandannas. Multiple antifa groups have been based in Nashville in recent years. No clear evidence antifa organized violent protests in Nashville While many of the protesters in Nashville on Saturday fit that description, it's unclear if any affiliate with antifa organizations. Metro Nashville Police Department Chief Steve Anderson said Sunday the city is investigating a small group of people they believe used the protest as a cover for violence and other criminal acts. The police chief did not say if any organized groups might be behind the violence in Nashville. A peaceful rally held downtown Saturday afternoon evolved throughout the evening, eventually turning from a march into a chaotic eruption of vandalism to public and private property. Metro Nashville's historic courthouse and city hall were set afire in the process, among other significant damage the building sustained. Antifa groups have, however, openly mobilized overwhelmingly nonviolent counterprotests at events like the October 2017 ""White Lives Matter Rally"" in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro, as well as made appearances at the annual American Renaissance conference held at Tennessee's Montgomery Bell State Park. The conference, which was canceled this year due to the coronavirus and therefore did not prompt a protest, is held by a white nationalist organization. The protest groups are typically met with a large number of park rangers and forced to demonstrate behind barriers, limiting the possibility for physical confrontations with the conference-goers. While some small altercations have taken place between protesters and counterprotesters at those events, there is no evidence that antifa activists have been responsible for inciting any type of significant violence in Tennessee. They frequently inhabit a very insular online space, trading jabs with individuals they believe to espouse white supremacist beliefs. As with other antifa activists around the nation, Jam City Antifa, a Nashville-based network, has been known to track area white supremacists and post photos and other identifying information about them online, sometimes encouraging followers to show up to heckle them at events. White supremacists have in turn done the same for antifa activists in the area. Last year, U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Knoxville, filed the ""Unmasking Antifa Act,"" legislation that sought to punish up to 15 years a person wearing a mask or disguise while committing a crime, including threatening or intimidating another individual ""exercising their constitutional rights or privileges,"" according to a statement from Burchett's office at the time. ""It’s time we get tough on this issue. These cowards wouldn’t act the way they do if the whole world could see their faces,” Burchett said at the time, which was pre-coronavirus pandemic. Trump's administration quick to cast blame on antifa amid protests U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Sunday also blamed antifa and other similar groups over the violent protests around the country. Barr did not say what specific groups may have been involved or where they came from, but he said the Justice Department and the FBI will work on identifying “criminal organizers and instigators” to be arrested and charged Trump's national security advisor Robert O'Brien told CNN Sunday that the administration planned to ""get to the bottom"" of antifa's role in the protests. And he said the president and Barr want to know what the FBI is doing to ""to track and dismantle and surveil and prosecute antifa."" O'Brien denounced ""these antifa militant radicals who come into our cities and cross state lines. ""They're organized, and use Molotov cocktails and fireworks and gas to burn down our cities, especially businesses in minority neighborhoods. It's got to be stopped,"" he said on ""State of the Union."" But some have blamed right-wing provocateurs seeking to incite a race war for the violence. ""The truth is nobody really knows,"" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Sunday on NBC News' ""Meet the Press."" ""What the exact political motivation is is unclear at this point. We need to investigate it,"" Ellison said. USA Today and Adam Tamburin contributed to this report. Reach Natalie Allison at nallison@tennessean.com. Follow her on Twitter at @natalie_allison.

Hundreds showed up to express their outrage Saturday over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis with what was planned to be a ""somber, silent"" demonstration along Wilma Rudolph Boulevard. Tensions flared at times, and Clarksville Police were forced to close down the highway when protesters took to the street around Terminal Road. But unlike protests across the nation that delved into violence and looting, the protest in Clarksville stayed peaceful, with protesters encouraging dialogue over destruction. Some of the reason why might be because Pitts and his wife, Cynthia, along with other local leaders including City Council members Richard Garrett and Valerie Guzman as well as state Rep. Jason Hodges, all turned out to hear residents speak up. Buy Photo Clarksville Mayor Joe Pitts, with his wife, Cynthia, listens to protesters in the middle of Wilma Rudolph Boulevard on Saturday. (Photo: Tony Centonze/For The Leaf-Chronicle) Why leaders like Pitts came out On Sunday, Pitts said he felt a duty to go out and listen to the protesters after Clarksville Police Chief Al Ansley called to let him know what was happening. He said he now feels a duty to continue to hear them. ""Our intent was just to go out and listen and see if we could engage them in a conversation, and we did,"" said Pitts, who said he and his wife remained there for aboout two and a half hours. He said protesters asked what could be done to effect change and how to address this challenge. ""I am out here to listen to you. You tell me,"" Pitts told the crowd as they expressed anger over everything from the killing of Lloyd to the 2017 bounty hunter slaying of Jalen Johnson in Clarksville. ""You've got to register to vote. You've got to speak out."" CLOSE Hundreds of people lined Wilma Rudolph Boulevard in Clarksville on Saturday to protest the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle Some in attendance pointed out these conversations are essential. ""It won't change if we don't listen, and it starts with a conversation,"" said Treva Gordon, the founder of L.O.S.S. (Lending our Shared Stories), as she streamed the event online for hours to more than 3,000 viewers at times. ""Both sides just need to listen."" But others countered what's needed now is action, not words. ""Our people are scared when they walk down the street. The people that are supposed to protect us are killing us,"" one protester said. ""This country's built on lies. It's built on the backs of black people,"" another protester told the mayor. ""The government's doing nothing for the people."" Buy Photo People line Wilma Rudolph Boulevard on Saturday night to protest the death of George Floyd. (Photo: Tony Centonze/For The Leaf-Chronicle) ""My message was I'm available if you have specific concerns about Clarksville,"" Pitts said. ""That was our central message. But mainly, we just wanted to let folks know we're listening, and will continue to listen. Last night wasn't the end; it was merely the beginning."" What Pitts believes is the path forward Pitts said he gave out lots of business cards with his contact information. He hopes those who took the time to protest also will take the time to follow up with him. ""I'm hopeful that the people who said they have specific concerns will reach out to me. We will make ourselves available to them whenever they want to because that's got to be the key to not just pay lip service,"" he said. He's hopeful they'll also show up on election day. ""People should register to vote and then vote, because you vote for people who make policy and laws,"" said Pitts, who acknowledged efforts fell short to change the laws regarding bounty hunters in the wake of Johnson's killing. ""People need to register to vote and vote, and make sure candidates and people who hold office are held accountable."" Buy Photo The northbound lanes of Wilma Rudolph Boulevard were shut down Saturday night as people protesting the death of George Floyd spilled onto the highway. (Photo: Tony Centonze/For The Leaf-Chronicle) He knows what people want is change. ""There was a lot of people who wanted action. My message to them is I can effect change on the Clarksville level as mayor, but I can also – as a citizen – effect change on the state and national level as a voter and citizen, and I will. I invite folks to join together and back candidates and push initiatives that make a change,"" Pitts said. He credits both the Clarksville police and the protesters themselves with keeping the demonstration peaceful. ""Our Clarksville Police Department was phenomenal. They were there not to make sure there was order among the protesters, but to make sure the right to peaceably assemble was maintained and enforced. So I was very impressed with the level of professionalism by our officers. Secondly, those who were out there marching and talking and just having a conversation, they were extremely interested in talking and not letting it get out of hand. In fact, they were policing their own. If someone was angry, they would intervene and calm them down. I think it was a very successful night,"" Pitts said. Buy Photo The northbound lanes of Wilma Rudolph Boulevard were shut down Saturday night as people protesting the death of George Floyd spilled onto the highway. (Photo: Tony Centonze/For The Leaf-Chronicle) But he knows many challenges still lie ahead. ""My feeling was we've got a lot of work to do as a community, as a state and as a nation. If we don't do more listening than talking, this is not going to go away,"" Pitts said. ""My commitment to our community is I'm going to listen.""

Chattanooga Police said afterward the tear gas was thrown by the Sheriff's Office and not the city police. City Police also said they were not given warning that the tear gas was going to be used. In another tense night in downtown Chattanooga, some in the group knocked off a light post at the historic building, prompting the move to force them down. A witness said, ""They were on the steps of the courthouse on the jail side on Walnut Street. Some of the protesters went to the top of the steps and were pulling on a banner that was strung between two light posts. ""The posts were not very well supported and one started teetering when they were pulling on the banner. The original intent did not appear to be vandalism other than taking down the banner.   ""Law enforcement ran up the stairs and threw the two to the ground and handcuffed them. People got upset.    ""Some of them started approaching the officers. Many, many more officers came up the steps to hold them back. There was a little tussle at one point, but then everyone was staying back while officers were pointing very large guns at the crowd - maybe rubber bullet guns? maybe tear gas?   ""Then a couple of minutes later they fired the tear gas and everyone dispersed temporarily and went back around to the other side of the courthouse.""   Just as quickly, the protestors headed back toward Coolidge Park, where speakers on bullhorns had been denouncing the action of Minneapolis Police in the death of George Floyd. A number of those in the crowd held signs denouncing racism. In North Chattanooga as midnight approached, members of the National Guard joined with law enforcement at the intersection of Market Street and Frazier Avenue. They stood at the edge of the street holding weapons and wearing riot gear. Protestors milled around and periodically there were sounds that appeared to be fireworks that startled the crowd. Earlier in the standoff at the courthouse on the Georgia Avenue side, protestors on their knees had chanted ""Hands Up. Don't Shoot."" There was an earlier protest on Sunday afternoon at the County Courthouse with local activist Marie Mott exhorting a small group. Mayor Andy Berke, who had not commented following a night of violence and 11 arrests on Saturday, issued this statement on Sunday night, “We encourage everyone in Chattanooga to exercise their First Amendment rights and express themselves in a safe way.” Following incidents of violence in downtown Nashville, Governor Bill Lee announced Sunday that the Tennessee National Guard will remain mobilized across the state and that the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, in coordination with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement authorities, will launch an investigation into unlawful incidents that occurred overnight. “The right to peaceful protest is foundational to our country, but the violence and vandalism that occurred in Nashville last night was unlawful and tears at the fabric of our community,” said Governor Lee. “We have reason to believe that many of those involved in unlawful acts are not Tennesseans and we will be working with law enforcement to investigate this further and bring those responsible to justice.” National Guard personnel are now mobilized across all three Grand Divisions to assist state and local law enforcement. The Tennessee National Guard stands ready, in partnership with local law enforcement, the Department of Safety, and TEMA, to ensure order and safety are maintained in the supported areas for as long as is warranted by the situation. In addition to support from the Guard, Governor Lee has authorized the continuation of a curfew in Nashville and will support similar measures in other Tennessee cities as requested. Curfew in the downtown Nashville area and Urban Services District of Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County will be effective 8 p.m. CDT on Sunday and will continue until 6 a.m. CDT on Monday. The curfew will not apply to law enforcement and fire department personnel, first responders, and other officials assisting with maintaining public safety, including medical personnel in the performance of their duties, and any other persons lawfully on the streets and in public places with permission from law enforcement personnel. Governor Bill Lee also issued the following statement: “The protests in Murfreesboro are no longer peaceful demonstrations but have escalated to overt threats to public safety and property. I support Mayor McFarland’s 7 p.m. curfew and have authorized both the Tennessee Highway Patrol and the National Guard to provide support on the ground in restoring order for the safety of our citizens.”   ",0.0

(WKRN) — Murfreesboro Mayor Shane McFarland issued a local ‘State of Emergency’ after tear gas and smoke bombs were deployed downtown near the entrance to Middle Tennessee State University. This comes after an earlier peaceful protest rally occurred in Murfreesboro’s downtown square. Murfreesboro Police said in a tweet on Sunday night that a crowd of protesters vandalized an armored vehicle and threw a brick through a window of Whiskey Dix. I’m told by @MboroPoliceDept that people were laying in the street and tear gas was used to disperse the crowd.

Lee. So far as of 9:30 p.m., two people were arrested for violating the curfew. One person overcome by tear gas was treated at the scene and refused transport. Another person received medical treatment after a fainting episode on the Square. No police were injured. This is a developing story. Stay with News 2 and WKRN.com for updates.

While the Memphis Police Department has not yet confirmed how many arrests were made, Commercial Appeal reporters saw at least 10 people detained. Throughout the night of activism, the 200 protesters were far flung. They trekked nearly 10 miles from a demonstration on Interstate 55, weaving through Downtown and later attempting to occupy the Hernando de Soto Bridge, an effort that was thwarted by a tense but non-violent interaction as law enforcement officers from several agencies blocked their path. Protesters first attempted to walk onto the I-55 interchange at the Memphis-Arkansas Bridge, also known as the Old Bridge. There they met a wall of Sheriff's deputies and Memphis police. After about half an hour facing off with the officers blocking their path at the Old Bridge, protesters left the officers there and ran down a hill and walked onto the interstate past cars and semi-trucks, whose drivers honked in support. Walking onto the interstate. MPD is already there pic.twitter.com/pTLDSCR0t1 — Desiree Stennett 〽️ (@Desi_Stennett) June 1, 2020 From there, protesters attempted to take the bridge again and were again stymied by law enforcement officers who they asked repeatedly to join them and march alongside them as a condemnation of police brutality and the actions of since-fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Chauvin was arrested on third-degree murder charges after video of him holding his knee against Floyd's neck as Floyd, who died minutes later, repeatedly yelled, ""I can't breathe."" Despite cries to ""stand with us"" the deputies held their position and didn't let protesters through. The protesters later lined up inches from a row of Shelby County deputies in riot gear near the entrance of the Hernando de Soto Bridge. With no barricade between them, protesters got into a shoving match with law enforcement who sprayed those in front with what appeared to be pepper spray and shot canisters of it into the crowd. As protesters ran, dousing themselves in milk to ease the sting, Antwan Morrow, 20, stayed and stood silently in front of deputies for about 20 minutes. ""It's no point of us running away,"" said Morrow, who ended up being the last protester in the area staring down more than 40 deputies and Tennessee State Troopers. ""Maybe if I stay here, they (law enforcement) will learn something."" Morrow later returned to the protest and confirmed with Commercial Appeal reporters than he made it home safely and was not arrested or injured. Dissent among protest leaders The protest began as has become normal at the National Civil Rights Museum around 6:30 p.m. Before 7 p.m., they were headed onto Main Street. People are gathering outside the @NCRMuseum for another #BLM protest here in Memphis. As with previous nights, we have a team from @memphisnews covering. pic.twitter.com/GvmQnNLRSP — Katherine Burgess〽️ (@KathsBurgess) May 31, 2020 Early into the night, the group of nearly 1,000 broke apart. One faction was led by Rob Brown and other activists affiliated with the Memphis chapter of Black Lives Matter while the other was led by DeVante Hill, the pastor and activist who led protesters on several days of non-violent marches. As the protest fractured, Hill, failing several times to silence his Black Lives Matter dissenters, left amid criticism from seasoned activists. They took issue with his leadership because, when an incident ended with a show of violent force from the Memphis Police Department overnight, he left before the violence started and did not go to jail to bail out those arrested. Regina Clarke, leader of the Poor People’s Campaign, repeatedly asked Hill if he even knew the names of the arrested. Despite the disagreement over tactics, Clarke said the Black Lives Matter members wanted to continue with the group with another leader at the helm. ""We're here because of the George Floyds, the Breonna Taylors and the Ahmaud Arberys,"" Clarke said. ""We can't allow the actions of people who have the wrong motive on why they're doing this to distract us from the main purpose of what our job is."" When Hill left, the protesters who wanted to march with him milled around before eventually going home while about 250 people followed Brown. Less physical force, more police presence Memphis police faced criticism after a video showing a sea of officers tackling a woman and knocking her violently to the ground during an incident that began about 10:45 p.m. Saturday. I tried to send this earlier but couldn’t in the chaos. A Memphis police officer is yelling “Somebody get her. Somebody get the girl in the gray hoodie.”  Then they swarm. pic.twitter.com/MlJ5y8YYbs — Desiree Stennett 〽️ (@Desi_Stennett) May 31, 2020 During protests Sunday night, though Memphis police did arrest several protesters who were assembling peacefully, tactics during the arrests were noticeably milder. The same self control was apparent when protesters clashed with officers at both bridges where officers either threatened the use of pepper spray or actually used it instead of pushing through their own barricades to tackle protesters or yelling ""Somebody get the girl in the gray hoodie"" before pouncing on women. Though the physical violence lessened Sunday night, officers continued to employ riot gear and show up in overwhelming numbers with their vehicles covering miles of Downtown Memphis, posing in some places even when there were no protesters present. Officers also continued to appear on horseback in greater numbers and employed a row of Humvees to add to the number of law enforcement vehicles than blanketed the area. The pepper spray was also used far more on Sunday to disperse the larger crowd. Although a statement from Memphis Police Director Michael Rallings did not go so far to say he thought his officers acted appropriately during the Saturday incident, he did defend the use riot gear, saying it was needed to protect officers. That's despite no protester tuning violent in five days. At their most aggressive, protesters have pushed officers, thrown a small number of glass or plastic bottles or thrown sticks. Other protesters usually step in to stop those in their numbers from going further, even as protests around the country also sparked by the death of George Floyd turn violent, ending in countless arrests and injures as well as looting and destroying property. It's possible that the protesting will continue though it's unclear who will lead them. Brown said he hopes the march goes until Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and County Mayor Lee Harris meet with the group to give them what they want. “This is the people’s movement,” he said Hill could not be reached for comment. It's unclear if he will continue organizing the protests, which have drawn large crowds to Downtown.

Local authorities imposed curfews in 25 cities in 16 states and some 5,000 National Guard troops were deployed at various sites in 15 states and the District of Columbia, with their prospective efforts to maintain order being praised by President Donald Trump. In Washington DC, on Saturday night about 70 Secret Service agents and Metro Police officers were injured during the disturbances near the White House and elsewhere in downtown DC and where police arrested 18 people, both departments reported on Sunday. The law enforcement and presidential protection service personnel were injured by being punched, having bricks, stones, bottles, firecrackers and other objects thrown at them. None of the injuries were said to be fatal, but officers and agents were taken to local hospitals for treatment. The Secret Service said that nobody was able to penetrate into the grounds of the White House and none of the people inside the presidential residence, including Trump, were ever in danger. The preparations by local authorities, law enforcement and National Guard troops came after a night of chaos on Saturday with looting, burning and hundreds of arrests in various parts of the country. According to CNN, among the cities imposing nighttime curfews on Sunday are Los Angeles, Denver, Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, Louisville, Rochester, Cleveland, Portland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Charleston, Nashville, Salt Lake City and Seattle. Saturday night was the fifth consecutive night of riots and protests sparked by the death last Monday of a black man, George Floyd, after he was arrested and then subdued by white Minneapolis police officers, one of whom knelt with his full body weight on Floyd’s neck – despite his pleas and complaints that he could not breathe – for more than eight minutes, evidently killing him either through asphyxiation or by cutting off the blood supply to his brain. The incident was caught on several videos taken by passersby, and these videos went viral online, outraging millions both in the US and abroad. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Sunday announced another nighttime curfew from 8 pm to 6 am in Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul. At a Sunday morning press conference, Walz explained his decision, saying that it would be “naive and irresponsible to abandon strategy” considering how well the curfew had worked on Friday and Saturday night, combined with the fact that the Minnesota National Guard was fully mobilized on Saturday evening. “The curfew on Friday and Saturday night allowed our law enforcement to target those who meant to do harm to our communities,” Walz said. “Law enforcement made several arrests and seized weapons, narcotics, long guns, handguns, magazines and knives. We have reason to believe that bad actors continue to infiltrate the rightful protests of George Floyd’s murder, which is why we are extending the curfew by one day,” he added. New York authorities on Sunday promised that “rapid” and “independent” investigations will be conducted into the violent confrontations between police and demonstrators on Saturday. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a Sunday press conference that the police had done many things right, but they had also made some mistakes that will be thoroughly investigated. Besides Minnesota and the District of Columbia, the states that have activated their National Guard troops are: Ohio, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin. Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported that the US Defense Department has put an engineers unit and a small number of Military Police units on alert, thus making them ready to deploy quickly if asked to do so. In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker had ordered – at her request – a National Guard contingent to maintain a limited presence in the city on Lake Michigan to support the local police so that the disturbances that occurred on Saturday night would not be repeated. During the riots and other unrest this week, at least three people have died by gunfire in Indianapolis, Detroit and Oakland, although police evidently were not involved in those deaths. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump lashed out at the media on Sunday, saying on Twitter that “The Lamestream Media is doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy. As long as everybody understands what they are doing, that they are FAKE NEWS and truly bad people with a sick agenda, we can easily work through them to GREATNESS!”",0.0

Streeter and another police officer have been fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest arrest incident involving two college students, Atlanta’s mayor said Sunday, May 31, 2020. (Atlanta Police Department via AP) ATLANTA (AP) — Two police officers have been fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest arrest incident involving two college students, Atlanta’s mayor said Sunday. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a news conference that she and police Chief Erika Shields made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage of a Saturday night incident that first gained attention from video online and on local news. “Use of excessive force is never acceptable,” Bottoms told reporters. Shields called the footage “really shocking to watch.” Police on Sunday night identified the fired officers as Investigator Ivory Streeter, who was hired in December 2003, and Investigator Mark Gardner, who was hired in August 1997. Bottoms said the woman, Taniyah Pilgrim, was released without charges. She said the man, Messiah Young, was released, too, and she’s ordering the charges against him dropped. She didn’t specify what charges he faced. A police report says Young was charged with attempting to elude police and driving with a suspended license. Dramatic body camera video that police released Sunday night shows police taking another young man into custody in a downtown street alongside a line of stopped cars. The man is pleading with police to let him go, saying he didn’t do anything. Young, sitting in the driver’s seat of a car stopped in the street holds up his phone, appearing to shoot video as an officer approaches and pulls the driver’s side door open. Young pulls the door shut and says repeatedly, “I’m not dying today.” He urges the officers to release the other man and let him get in the car as the dark sedan advances a bit. The car gets stuck in traffic and officers run up to both sides of the car shouting orders. An officer uses a stun gun on Pilgrim as she’s trying to get out of the car and then officers pull her from the vehicle. Another officer yells at Young to put the car in park and open the window. An officer repeatedly hits the driver’s side window with a baton, and another officer finally manages to break it. As the glass shatters, an officer uses a stun gun on Young and officers pull him from the car as officers shout, “Get your hand out of your pockets,” and, “He got a gun. He got a gun. He got a gun.” Once he’s out of the car and on the ground, officers zip tie Young’s hands behind his back and lead him away. Police reports do not list a gun as having been recovered. The mayor said she had delayed the news conference several hours to review all the body-camera footage because she and Shields wanted to be certain about what happened. “I really wanted to believe that the body-worn camera footage would provide some larger view that could better rationalize why we got to this space,” Shields said. “And having spent most of the afternoon with the mayor, reviewing the footage exhaustively, I knew that I had only one option, and that is to terminate the employees.” Bottoms said she had spoken to leaders at Spelman College and Morehouse College, where she said the the young people were students. She said she’d also spoken to representatives for the students but hadn’t yet spoken directly to them. Shields offered an apology and said she knows the officers’ behavior was unacceptable and caused further fear. “Sometimes the best thing, the only thing you can do as a police chief is come in and clean up the mess that’s before you,” Shields said. “When wrong is wrong, we have to, as law enforcement, start dealing with it in the same manner that we would deal with it with non-law enforcement,” Shields said. “For some reason, we’ve fallen into a gray area where there’s a separate set of rules for law enforcement, and if we want to get out of this space that we’re in now we have to change how we manage internally.” Shields said she experienced a broad range of emotions as just a few hours before she saw the video, another of her officers was seriously injured. A preliminary investigation indicates the officer was in an intersection on foot to block traffic from passing into an area where there were protesters when a person on an ATV approached at a high rate of speed and hit him. Officer Maximilian Brewer suffered significant injuries to his legs and remained in the intensive care unit Sunday evening, Shields said, adding that she hopes he’ll be able to walk again. The ATV rider was taken into custody at the scene and to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police on Sunday night identified the driver of the ATV as 42-year-old Avery Goggans. He has been charged with DUI, serious injury by vehicle, reckless driving, possession of marijuana and several other traffic charges, police Sgt. John Chafee said in an email. Bottoms imposed a 9 p.m. curfew for Saturday and Sunday. Gov. Brian Kemp authorized up to 3,000 National Guard troops to be deployed in cities across the state to respond if needed to protests over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in coastal Georgia. Atlanta police said Sunday they had arrested more than 150 people as protesters threw rocks at officers and broke windows in the downtown area. The curfew was initially imposed after demonstrations Friday night turned violent with people setting fires and smashing windows at businesses and restaurants.",0.0

While the Memphis Police Department has not yet confirmed how many arrests were made, Commercial Appeal reporters saw at least 10 people detained. Throughout the night of activism, the 200 protesters were far flung. They trekked nearly 10 miles from a demonstration on Interstate 55, weaving through Downtown and later attempting to occupy the Hernando de Soto Bridge, an effort that was thwarted by a tense but non-violent interaction as law enforcement officers from several agencies blocked their path. Protesters first attempted to walk onto the I-55 interchange at the Memphis-Arkansas Bridge, also known as the Old Bridge. There they met a wall of Sheriff's deputies and Memphis police. After about half an hour facing off with the officers blocking their path at the Old Bridge, protesters left the officers there and ran down a hill and walked onto the interstate past cars and semi-trucks, whose drivers honked in support. Walking onto the interstate. MPD is already there pic.twitter.com/pTLDSCR0t1 — Desiree Stennett 〽️ (@Desi_Stennett) June 1, 2020 From there, protesters attempted to take the bridge again and were again stymied by law enforcement officers who they asked repeatedly to join them and march alongside them as a condemnation of police brutality and the actions of since-fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Chauvin was arrested on third-degree murder charges after video of him holding his knee against Floyd's neck as Floyd, who died minutes later, repeatedly yelled, ""I can't breathe."" Despite cries to ""stand with us"" the deputies held their position and didn't let protesters through. The protesters later lined up inches from a row of Shelby County deputies in riot gear near the entrance of the Hernando de Soto Bridge. With no barricade between them, protesters got into a shoving match with law enforcement who sprayed those in front with what appeared to be pepper spray and shot canisters of it into the crowd. As protesters ran, dousing themselves in milk to ease the sting, Antwan Morrow, 20, stayed and stood silently in front of deputies for about 20 minutes. ""It's no point of us running away,"" said Morrow, who ended up being the last protester in the area staring down more than 40 deputies and Tennessee State Troopers. ""Maybe if I stay here, they (law enforcement) will learn something."" Morrow later returned to the protest and confirmed with Commercial Appeal reporters than he made it home safely and was not arrested or injured. Dissent among protest leaders The protest began as has become normal at the National Civil Rights Museum around 6:30 p.m. Before 7 p.m., they were headed onto Main Street.

One faction was led by Rob Brown and other activists affiliated with the Memphis chapter of Black Lives Matter while the other was led by DeVante Hill, the pastor and activist who led protesters on several days of non-violent marches. As the protest fractured, Hill, failing several times to silence his Black Lives Matter dissenters, left amid criticism from seasoned activists. They took issue with his leadership because, when an incident ended with a show of violent force from the Memphis Police Department overnight, he left before the violence started and did not go to jail to bail out those arrested. Regina Clarke, leader of the Poor People’s Campaign, repeatedly asked Hill if he even knew the names of the arrested. Despite the disagreement over tactics, Clarke said the Black Lives Matter members wanted to continue with the group with another leader at the helm. ""We're here because of the George Floyds, the Breonna Taylors and the Ahmaud Arberys,"" Clarke said. ""We can't allow the actions of people who have the wrong motive on why they're doing this to distract us from the main purpose of what our job is."" When Hill left, the protesters who wanted to march with him milled around before eventually going home while about 250 people followed Brown. Less physical force, more police presence Memphis police faced criticism after a video showing a sea of officers tackling a woman and knocking her violently to the ground during an incident that began about 10:45 p.m. Saturday.

The same self control was apparent when protesters clashed with officers at both bridges where officers either threatened the use of pepper spray or actually used it instead of pushing through their own barricades to tackle protesters or yelling ""Somebody get the girl in the gray hoodie"" before pouncing on women. Though the physical violence lessened Sunday night, officers continued to employ riot gear and show up in overwhelming numbers with their vehicles covering miles of Downtown Memphis, posing in some places even when there were no protesters present. Officers also continued to appear on horseback in greater numbers and employed a row of Humvees to add to the number of law enforcement vehicles than blanketed the area. The pepper spray was also used far more on Sunday to disperse the larger crowd. Although a statement from Memphis Police Director Michael Rallings did not go so far to say he thought his officers acted appropriately during the Saturday incident, he did defend the use riot gear, saying it was needed to protect officers. That's despite no protester tuning violent in five days. At their most aggressive, protesters have pushed officers, thrown a small number of glass or plastic bottles or thrown sticks. Other protesters usually step in to stop those in their numbers from going further, even as protests around the country also sparked by the death of George Floyd turn violent, ending in countless arrests and injures as well as looting and destroying property. It's possible that the protesting will continue though it's unclear who will lead them. Brown said he hopes the march goes until Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and County Mayor Lee Harris meet with the group to give them what they want. “This is the people’s movement,” he said Hill could not be reached for comment. It's unclear if he will continue organizing the protests, which have drawn large crowds to Downtown.

Detectives from the specialized investigations division and SWAT officers took Wesley Somers, 25, into custody Sunday night at a home on Manzano Road in Madison, police said. Somers did not cooperate with detectives after his arrest, and Police Chief Steve Anderson said a motive had not been identified. Citizen tips and pictures from the scene led investigators to Somers, police said. Anderson said more arrests are expected as the arson investigation continued. Officials have said they believe a small, coordinated group of instigators infiltrated the ""I Will Breathe"" rally and march, which drew more than a thousand people to downtown Nashville. The demonstration — one of several happening across the country — was organized to protest police brutality and the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after an officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes. Protesters remained peaceful for hours before isolated bursts of violence and vandalism arose, first at the Central Precinct and then at the courthouse. Individuals threw rocks, smashed windows, pummeled police cruisers and damaged more than 30 buildings in the downtown corridor. The courthouse windows were smashed, its walls were spray painted with graffiti and fires were started inside the building, damaging a portion of the mayor's office. A plaque commemorating the civil rights movement in Nashville was destroyed. Officers dressed in riot gear deployed tear gas as people clustered in Public Square Park, the green space in front of the courthouse. Gov. Bill Lee authorized a curfew in Nashville and deployed the National Guard in an effort to diffuse the chaos. While Somers appeared to be local, Lee said there was evidence some of the individuals had traveled to Tennessee from out of state to commit crimes during the protest. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and other state agencies are looking into the matter. Anderson said the police department suspected some of the violence was premeditated. ""Obviously there was some organization that occurred,"" he said Monday during a media briefing. “It was a criminal element that entered into this group of people and organized what they did” Exclusive: Nashville police looking for 20-30 people they say drove violence during Saturday protest More: Fire seen at Nashville courthouse and City Hall building as protests turn violent A fire is started outside the Metro Courthouse in Nashville, Tennessee, on Saturday, May 30, 2020, after the “I Will Breathe” rally to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being pinned down while handcuffed by a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day. Police identified the man shown as Wesley Somers, 25, and charged him with arson on Sunday. (Photo: Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean) Somers is facing charges of aggravated arson and disorderly conduct. He was booked into the Metro Jail, and his bond was set at $755,000. BREAKING: Specialized Investigations Division detectives & SWAT officers moments ago arrested Wesley Somers, 25, on charges of felony arson, vandalism, & disorderly conduct for setting fire to Nashville's Historic Courthouse Saturday night. pic.twitter.com/tg0AFrU3OP — Metro Nashville PD (@MNPDNashville) June 1, 2020 Somers has prior criminal charges in Davidson and Sumner counties, including ones for drug paraphernalia, child neglect and domestic assault. In December 2016, officers said they observed Somers using heroin in a vehicle in a Walmart parking lot. His two young children, who were 2-year-old and 8-months-old at the time, were with him, the Davidson County affidavit shows. In another instance, in July 2017, Somers was accused of aggravated assault. A woman called police in Sumner County after jumping out a car Somers was driving, according to the arrest affidavit. Officers found her with a “busted” lip and swelling to the left side of her head. Wesley Ryan Baxter, who no longer lives in Tennessee, got to know Somers several years ago when they often met up on jobs for different environmental companies in the area several years ago. Baxter described Somers as a hard worker who sometimes put in 12 to 14 hour days, he said. “Never in a hundred-million years did I see anything like that coming,” Baxter said of the allegations Somers set fire to the courthouse.

1621877701,2020-05-31 21:46:31,George Floyd family lawyer says cop may have known victim; Donald Trump praises National Guard; major cities impose curfews: Live updates,http://rssfeeds.dnj.com/~/625679180/0/murfreesboro/home~George-Floyd-family-lawyer-says-cop-may-have-known-victim-Donald-Trump-praises-National-Guard-major-cities-impose-curfews-Live-updates/,en,False,,90683,dnj.com,http://www.dnj.com/#spider,"As cities nationwide launched clean-up efforts and President Donald Trump called antifa a terrorist organization, a special prosecutor was named in the case of George Floyd, whose death in the custody of Minneapolis police continued to reverberate across the nation. Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing the family of Floyd, said the police officer who pressed his knee on the man's neck may have known him and should be charged with first-degree murder. Officer Derek Chauvin was charged with second-degree manslaughter and third-degree murder and fired last week, days after the confrontation. Amid urging by Floyd family members and Minneapolis leaders, Gov. Tim Walz named state Attorney General Keith Ellison as special prosecutor to examine Floyd's death. In Chicago, one of dozens of cities dealing with sometimes-violent protests, more than 20 police officers were injured, dozens of buildings were damaged and several vehicles burned Saturday night. On Saturday's National Day of Protest, tens of thousands of people took to the streets. Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta were among cities enacting curfews to quell the upheaval prompted by Floyd's death, racial inequities and police brutality. In New York, fires burned, and a video shared on social media appeared to show a police car driving into a crowd of protesters. Some journalists covering the demonstrations were injured by tear gas, smoke bombs and nonlethal projectiles fired by police. In Pittsburgh at least three local journalists were injured by protesters, police said. Resources, ways to donate: How you can take action from home Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. Here are the latest developments: Minneapolis police chief: Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN in an interview George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. The killing of Mr. Floyd was an absolute truth that it was wrong. I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on -- this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to lead prosecution Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it – at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.” Semi-truck driver hospitalized, arrested after 'inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators' The Minnesota Department of Public Safety confirmed a semi-truck driver was hospitalized and arrested after video surfaced showing protesters scattering after a truck drove into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators on Interstate 35. The Department of Public Safety called the driver's actions ""very disturbing"" and added the driver was ""inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators."" Videos from the scene showed an 18-wheeler driving toward a large crowd of fleeing protesters before coming to a stop. The demonstrators converged on the truck after it stopped. ""The truck driver was injured & taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries,"" the Department of Public Safety tweeted. ""He is under arrest. It doesn’t appear any protesters were hit by the truck."" Cities nationwide brace for more protests After nights of chaos nationwide, cities braced for more protests in the wake of Floyd's death. Many protests have followed similar patterns – there's peace at first, but things eventually turn for the worse, typically at night. In Santa Monica, California, for example there was peaceful protest where hundreds gathered, marched and took a knee for more than two minutes. However, there were also reports of looting. A video on social media showed a woman attempting to stop looters from breaking into a store. Other cities also had peaceful demonstrations early and late afternoon Sunday. In Minneapolis, the epicenter of the protests, there was a sense of calm. Volunteer crews cleaned up broken glass and rubble left behind following widespread looting and protesting. In a change from previous days, city public works crews helped managed the process, which was undertaken primarily by volunteers. Still, some believed there was more damage to come. So far, just one of the four officers involved in the incident that ended with Floyd's death has been charged. Minneapolis residents want charges for the other three. 'We’re here to make a difference': Protesters return to White House Hundreds of protesters returned to the White House on Sunday, a day after demonstrations turned violent and police used tear gas to dispel crowds in Lafayette Park. The park was shuttered Sunday and nearby buildings remained boarded up, but police and members of U.S. Secret Service lined the facade of the White House as demonstrations carried on just outside the entrance at 16th and H streets. Clutching signs that read, “end police brutality” and “peace, but not patience. We need change now,” protesters chanted and clapped as the crowds swelled in the late afternoon sun. Amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, most people in the crowd wore face-coverings. – Courtney Subramanian, David Jackson and Kristine Phillips 'Perfect storm' of civil unrest following Floyd's death, experts say Why did Floyd’s death spark such widespread, visceral outrage, while three other deaths of African Americans this year – Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Tony McDade, a black transgender man killed by police officers in Tallahassee – did not? An array of combustible issues converged to form a “perfect storm” of civil unrest after Floyd’s death and could lead to longer-lasting changes, experts and protest organizers said. The coronavirus pandemic that has sequestered most Americans in their homes, forced millions into unemployment and has disproportionately infected African Americans already had many simmering with rage and frustration, said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the National Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “The depths of despair are enormous right now for black people in this country,” she said. “You pile on unchecked police violence and it makes for a perfect storm.” – Rick Jervis Major cities across US impose curfews into Monday morning amid protests As cities where protests have erupted try to quell the demonstrations, several governors and mayors across the country imposed or extended curfews Sunday in anticipation of another night of unrest. More than 20 cities imposed some type of curfew. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced he would extend curfew for Minneapolis and St. Paul through Monday morning. Other cities that have announced curfews include Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Seattle and Louisville – where Breonna Taylor was killed . Donald Trump says he'll designate Antifa as a terror organization President Donald Trump announced Sunday a left-wing group he thinks is leading the violence at anti-police brutality protests will be officially labeled terrorists. ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,"" Trump said. Antifa – short for ""anti-fascist"" – is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups involved in some violent clashes in recent years. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership. – William Cummings and Kristine Phillips Crump: Officer may have known George Floyd before confrontation The lawyer for Floyd's family says the owner of a nightclub where Floyd worked notified the family his accused killer, Derek Chauvin, was an off-duty officer there. ""They had to overlap,"" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump told CBS's Face the Nation. ""And so that is going to be an interesting aspect to this case and hopefully upgrading these charges to first-degree murder because we believe he knew who George Floyd was."" Both worked security at the El Nuevo Rodeo, according to former owner Maya Santamaria. But Santamaria said they may not have known each other since Chauvin, as an off-duty police officer, worked outside, while Floyd worked inside. Crump said Floyd showed intent to kill by keeping his knee in Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes while Floyd was ""begging and pleading for breath,"" Crump said. 60 Secret Service agents injured in protests More than 60 Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters in Washington, D.C., on Friday and Saturday, the agency said. Some were assaulted, “kicked, punched and exposed to bodily fluids,” officials said. Eleven were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Officials said protesters vandalized six Secret Service vehicles, repeatedly tried to knock over security barriers, and threw bricks, rocks, bottles, fireworks and other items at Secret Service personnel. Seventeen people were arrested during protests Saturday night when organized groups “bent” on destruction took over the demonstration, Mayor Muriel Bowser said. – Kristine Phillips 1 dead in Chicago Six people were shot, and one was killed, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. More than 20 officers went to the hospital, and at least two required surgery, said Superintendent David Brown. Police made 240 arrests, Brown said. In a Sunday morning news conference, Lightfoot called Saturday night’s destruction downtown “devastating.” She said cars were set on fire and windows were smashed. “Is that how we bring social justice? Is that how we bring change? Certainly not,” she said. Lightfoot said, in addition to the city’s curfew, she was bringing in the Illinois National Guard and limiting access to the downtown Loop area, where protests took place. Lightfoot also said she was suspending transit services to the Loop. – Grace Hauck Minneapolis 'picking up a broom' No loss of life nor major fire damage was reported after bursts of violence that on Saturday night once again rocked Minneapolis, a city under siege of protests for almost a week, Mayor Jacob Frey said. ""The events of last night were obviously difficult to watch, but the restoration of order was important,"" Frey said at a news conference Sunday. Frey said he was encouraged to see residents ""coming out of their homes, picking up a broom"" to help sweep away the debris from nights of violence. Trump tweeted congratulations to the National Guard for the ""great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis."" The city planned to impose an 8 p.m. curfew Sunday. Frey pledged to make the state and city a better place for people of color. ""The action of one officer and the inaction of three officers have forever change our city,"" he said. ""We must become a better city. We must become a more just city."" Former police officer Chauvin could face additional charges, and officers at the scene of George Floyd's death are “not out of the woods,” Attorney General Ellison said Sunday. Chauvin's partner and two other officers who arrived on the scene as events unfolded have not been charged. Ellison, speaking on NBC's Meet the Press, said County Prosecutor Mike Freeman could charge the other officers with aiding and abetting, among other counts. 'Multiple shootings,' 2 fatalities in Indianapolis The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department confirmed two fatalities, and said it was investigating ""multiple"" shootings, none of which were officer-involved, after a second night of violence raged through parts of downtown. Clashes broke out in a haze of tear gas a little after 9 p.m., about two hours after city officials asked protest organizers to wrap up their events and clear the streets. Several protesters were arrested and widespread vandalism was reported in the aftermath. It was a far different scene earlier in the day, when thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully through Downtown streets chanting slogans such as ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No Justice – No Peace."" – Tim Evans, Indianapolis Star Mississippi mayor apologizes for George Floyd Twitter post A Mississippi mayor has apologized for social media posts that seemed to defend the behavior of Minneapolis police in Floyd's death. Petal Mayor Hal Marx, however, denied his comments were racist and said he won't resign. ""I admit that my comments on the recent tragic death of George Floyd in Minnesota were made in haste and not well-thought out or expressed,"" he said. He apologized to the city's 10,000 residents and anyone who might have been offended. The post, which he deleted from Twitter, said, ""if you can say you can’t breathe, you’re breathing. Most likely that man died of overdose or heart attack. Video doesn’t show his resistance that got him in that position. Police being crucified."" – Lici Beveridge, Mississippi Clarion-Ledger 4 officers, 3 journalists injured in Pittsburgh Four police officers and three local journalists were injured by protesters in Pittsburgh, the city Public Safety Department said. At least two police cars were set ablaze, as was an American flag, police said. Forty-three adults and one juvenile were arrested. State police were called in, and downtown property damage was ""extensive"" with dozens of businesses looted, the public safety department tweeted. Mayor Bill Peduto accused white, male ""anarchists"" of hijacking the protest. “To those vandalizing downtown, you will be arrested,” Peduto said. “You have turned on the very mission, and more importantly – the people, you supposedly marched for."" Read this:Minnesota officials say 'outside agitators' are hijacking peaceful protests. So, who are they? Police join protest in Alaska An ""I Can't Breathe"" rally on the waterfront in Juneau, Alaska, was joined by local residents, elected officials – and police officers. Floyd uttered ""I can't breathe"" multiple times in the moments before he died. Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer said he and other members of his department attended the rally to show solidarity with residents, saying he won't ""tolerate excessive use of force."" The rally featured Alaska Native songs performed by members of Yees Ku Oo dance group, a multi-cultural group from Juneau. “I’m here just to show that we are in this community and let people know that our voices matter and for people to stop killing us,” Jennifer Gross, an African-American woman, told the Juneau Empire. 'Don’t go out of your homes': Tough response in Twin Cities Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised to bring ""the full force of goodness and righteousness"" as law enforcement enforced a curfew in Minneapolis. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Walz said. As part of the state's increased enforcement, the Minnesota National Guard said more than 4,100 service members had been deployed to the Twin Cities and projected more than 10,000 would soon be called up. Several hours after the 8 p.m. curfew began Saturday, there were ""no reported injuries of consequence,"" Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told the media. Follow USA TODAY reporters Trevor Hughes and Tyler Davis for reports from the ground in the Twin Cities. Los Angeles mayor asks for National Guard amid violence In Los Angeles, police cars burned after thousands of protesters gathered at Pan Pacific Park spilled out into streets. Mayor Eric Garcetti asked for the National Guard to be sent in to the nation's second-largest city as protesters torched police cars and vandalized and burglarized stores while clashing with lines of officers. Garcetti said he asked Gov. Gavin Newsom for 500 to 700 members of the Guard. Elsewhere in California, a few hundred chanting demonstrators marched through San Francisco while northeast of San Diego, police fired tear gas to try to break up a large group that defied orders to leave the La Mesa police headquarters. Fires at courthouse and City Hall building in Nashville Fires in Nashville led Mayor John Cooper to declare a state of civil emergency Saturday night. Police announced a 10 p.m. curfew for the city, and Gov. Bill Lee deployed the National Guard. Dozens of protesters had gathered on the steps of Nashville's criminal courthouse and City Hall after a rally and march. Demonstrators smashed windows with rocks and other materials, drawing a swarm of police. The situation at the building appeared to subside around 7:30 p.m. By 8:15 p.m., fire was visible from a first-floor office at the courthouse. A short time later, police with riot gear arrived as a fire burned inside a window at City Hall. Officers deployed tear gas as demonstrators clustered in the center of Public Square Park. — Staff of The Tennessean Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

While the Memphis Police Department has not yet confirmed how many arrests were made, Commercial Appeal reporters saw at least 10 people detained. Throughout the night of activism, the 200 protesters were far flung. They trekked nearly 10 miles from a demonstration on Interstate 55, weaving through Downtown and later attempting to occupy the Hernando de Soto Bridge, an effort that was thwarted by a tense but non-violent interaction as law enforcement officers from several agencies blocked their path. Protesters first attempted to walk onto the I-55 interchange at the Memphis-Arkansas Bridge, also known as the Old Bridge. There they met a wall of Sheriff's deputies and Memphis police. After about half an hour facing off with the officers blocking their path at the Old Bridge, protesters left the officers there and ran down a hill and walked onto the interstate past cars and semi-trucks, whose drivers honked in support.

Chauvin was arrested on third-degree murder charges after video of him holding his knee against Floyd's neck as Floyd, who died minutes later, repeatedly yelled, ""I can't breathe."" Despite cries to ""stand with us"" the deputies held their position and didn't let protesters through. The protesters later lined up inches from a row of Shelby County deputies in riot gear near the entrance of the Hernando de Soto Bridge. With no barricade between them, protesters got into a shoving match with law enforcement who sprayed those in front with what appeared to be pepper spray and shot canisters of it into the crowd. As protesters ran, dousing themselves in milk to ease the sting, Antwan Morrow, 20, stayed and stood silently in front of deputies for about 20 minutes. ""It's no point of us running away,"" said Morrow, who ended up being the last protester in the area staring down more than 40 deputies and Tennessee State Troopers. ""Maybe if I stay here, they (law enforcement) will learn something."" Morrow later returned to the protest and confirmed with Commercial Appeal reporters than he made it home safely and was not arrested or injured. Dissent among protest leaders The protest began as has become normal at the National Civil Rights Museum around 6:30 p.m. Before 7 p.m., they were headed onto Main Street.

One faction was led by Rob Brown and other activists affiliated with the Memphis chapter of Black Lives Matter while the other was led by DeVante Hill, the pastor and activist who led protesters on several days of non-violent marches. As the protest fractured, Hill, failing several times to silence his Black Lives Matter dissenters, left amid criticism from seasoned activists. They took issue with his leadership because, when an incident ended with a show of violent force from the Memphis Police Department overnight, he left before the violence started and did not go to jail to bail out those arrested. Regina Clarke, leader of the Poor People’s Campaign, repeatedly asked Hill if he even knew the names of the arrested. Despite the disagreement over tactics, Clarke said the Black Lives Matter members wanted to continue with the group with another leader at the helm. ""We're here because of the George Floyds, the Breonna Taylors and the Ahmaud Arberys,"" Clarke said. ""We can't allow the actions of people who have the wrong motive on why they're doing this to distract us from the main purpose of what our job is."" When Hill left, the protesters who wanted to march with him milled around before eventually going home while about 250 people followed Brown.

The same self control was apparent when protesters clashed with officers at both bridges where officers either threatened the use of pepper spray or actually used it instead of pushing through their own barricades to tackle protesters or yelling ""Somebody get the girl in the gray hoodie"" before pouncing on women. Though the physical violence lessened Sunday night, officers continued to employ riot gear and show up in overwhelming numbers with their vehicles covering miles of Downtown Memphis, posing in some places even when there were no protesters present. Officers also continued to appear on horseback in greater numbers and employed a row of Humvees to add to the number of law enforcement vehicles than blanketed the area. The pepper spray was also used far more on Sunday to disperse the larger crowd. Although a statement from Memphis Police Director Michael Rallings did not go so far to say he thought his officers acted appropriately during the Saturday incident, he did defend the use riot gear, saying it was needed to protect officers. That's despite no protester tuning violent in five days. At their most aggressive, protesters have pushed officers, thrown a small number of glass or plastic bottles or thrown sticks. Other protesters usually step in to stop those in their numbers from going further, even as protests around the country also sparked by the death of George Floyd turn violent, ending in countless arrests and injures as well as looting and destroying property. It's possible that the protesting will continue though it's unclear who will lead them. Brown said he hopes the march goes until Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and County Mayor Lee Harris meet with the group to give them what they want. “This is the people’s movement,” he said Hill could not be reached for comment.

The violence ensued afterward and it was an attempt to set back civil rights progress in Nashville. Story Highlights David Plazas is the director of opinion and engagement for the USA TODAY Network Tennessee. Nashville wanted and deserved a peaceful protest on Saturday. The afternoon rally at Tennessee’s Legislative Plaza in downtown Nashville was peaceful and an amazing example of civic engagement and good citizenship. The violence that ensued after it finished, perpetrated by troublemakers separate from rally organizers, was atrocious and an affront to basic decency. The Old Courthouse that houses city hall was set on fire. A plaque commemorating the protests of 1960 that ended the desegregation of lunch counters was destroyed. Downtown businesses were vandalized and looted. The bad actors, whoever they are, wanted to stain Nashville, delegitimize the rally, sow distrust among citizens and set our civil rights progress way behind. It is important to decouple the two events. CLOSE Protesters set fire outside a window at Nashville's Metropolitan Courthouse Saturday, May 30, 2020 Nashville Tennessean Nashville's civil rights history is complicated In the first, more than a thousand people of diverse races and backgrounds gathered to denounce police brutality, demand justice for African Americans and communities of color, and call for transformational systemic change that has disproportionately kept marginalized people from benefiting from America’s promise. The afternoon rally was inspired by the brutal and unjustified killing of George Floyd, an African American man, by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25. Derek Chauvin was fired from the police force and is now charged with Floyd’s murder. People gather on Legislative Plaza in Nashville, Tenn., Saturday, May 30, 2020 for the “I Will Breathe” rally to protest the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after being pinned down by a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day. (Photo: Larry McCormack/ The Tennessean) Nashville has a complicated legacy when it comes to civil rights. The student sit-in movement was birthed, nurtured and sustained in Music City. But the remnants of segregation persist in housing patterns and displacement and in inequitable access to health care, education and job opportunities. African Americans and communities of color are disproportionately incarcerated at a higher rate than white citizens. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed the problem; African Americans are getting sicker and dying at a disproportionately higher rate than their white peers. In addition, Metro Nashville Police Department’s handling of the killings of two black men — Jocques Clemmons in 2017 and Daniel Hambrick in 2018 — at the hands of white police officers has been highly criticized. So much so, that 60% of Nashville voters approved a community oversight board of police in November 2018. The African American community’s call for such a board had been made for at least 40 years. To his credit, Metro Nashville Police Department Chief Steve Anderson — who has long been a target of community criticism for over policing minority communities — condemned Floyd’s killing. Blame the perpetrators of violence for the mayhem Metro Nashville-Davidson County Mayor John Cooper invited the Metro Council and the community to join him at Saturday’s peaceful rally. It was a call for unity, peace and collaboration at a fraught time in our nation and contrasted the divisive, toxic and violent rhetoric of other leaders. On his social media posts, Cooper has faced criticism from people blaming him for the violence. But he is not to blame. The people who committed the atrocious acts are, and they should be held accountable for their misdeeds. Nashville is in a state of stress and healing in the aftermath of the March 3 tornadoes, COVID-19, the economic fallout from the pandemic and now Saturday night’s violence. However, it is incumbent upon our leaders and fellow citizens to continue to do the work, despite the setbacks, struggles and frustration, to move Nashville toward a place where equity and inclusion are not just talked about but are achieved by all in the community. We cannot be deterred. We will not be deterred.

Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing the family of Floyd, said the police officer who pressed his knee on the man's neck may have known him and should be charged with first-degree murder. Officer Derek Chauvin was charged with second-degree manslaughter and third-degree murder and fired last week, days after the confrontation. Amid urging by Floyd family members and Minneapolis leaders, Gov. Tim Walz named state Attorney General Keith Ellison as special prosecutor to examine Floyd's death. In Chicago, one of dozens of cities dealing with sometimes-violent protests, more than 20 police officers were injured, dozens of buildings were damaged and several vehicles burned Saturday night. On Saturday's National Day of Protest, tens of thousands of people took to the streets. Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta were among cities enacting curfews to quell the upheaval prompted by Floyd's death, racial inequities and police brutality. In New York, fires burned, and a video shared on social media appeared to show a police car driving into a crowd of protesters. Some journalists covering the demonstrations were injured by tear gas, smoke bombs and nonlethal projectiles fired by police. In Pittsburgh at least three local journalists were injured by protesters, police said. Resources, ways to donate: How you can take action from home Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. Here are the latest developments: Minneapolis police chief: Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN in an interview George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. The killing of Mr. Floyd was an absolute truth that it was wrong. I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on -- this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to lead prosecution Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it – at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.” Semi-truck driver hospitalized, arrested after 'inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators' The Minnesota Department of Public Safety confirmed a semi-truck driver was hospitalized and arrested after video surfaced showing protesters scattering after a truck drove into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators on Interstate 35. The Department of Public Safety called the driver's actions ""very disturbing"" and added the driver was ""inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators."" Videos from the scene showed an 18-wheeler driving toward a large crowd of fleeing protesters before coming to a stop. The demonstrators converged on the truck after it stopped. ""The truck driver was injured & taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries,"" the Department of Public Safety tweeted. ""He is under arrest. It doesn’t appear any protesters were hit by the truck."" Cities nationwide brace for more protests After nights of chaos nationwide, cities braced for more protests in the wake of Floyd's death. Many protests have followed similar patterns – there's peace at first, but things eventually turn for the worse, typically at night. In Santa Monica, California, for example there was peaceful protest where hundreds gathered, marched and took a knee for more than two minutes. However, there were also reports of looting. A video on social media showed a woman attempting to stop looters from breaking into a store. Other cities also had peaceful demonstrations early and late afternoon Sunday. In Minneapolis, the epicenter of the protests, there was a sense of calm. Volunteer crews cleaned up broken glass and rubble left behind following widespread looting and protesting. In a change from previous days, city public works crews helped managed the process, which was undertaken primarily by volunteers. Still, some believed there was more damage to come. So far, just one of the four officers involved in the incident that ended with Floyd's death has been charged. Minneapolis residents want charges for the other three. 'We’re here to make a difference': Protesters return to White House Hundreds of protesters returned to the White House on Sunday, a day after demonstrations turned violent and police used tear gas to dispel crowds in Lafayette Park. The park was shuttered Sunday and nearby buildings remained boarded up, but police and members of U.S. Secret Service lined the facade of the White House as demonstrations carried on just outside the entrance at 16th and H streets. Clutching signs that read, “end police brutality” and “peace, but not patience. We need change now,” protesters chanted and clapped as the crowds swelled in the late afternoon sun. Amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, most people in the crowd wore face-coverings. – Courtney Subramanian, David Jackson and Kristine Phillips 'Perfect storm' of civil unrest following Floyd's death, experts say Why did Floyd’s death spark such widespread, visceral outrage, while three other deaths of African Americans this year – Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Tony McDade, a black transgender man killed by police officers in Tallahassee – did not? An array of combustible issues converged to form a “perfect storm” of civil unrest after Floyd’s death and could lead to longer-lasting changes, experts and protest organizers said. The coronavirus pandemic that has sequestered most Americans in their homes, forced millions into unemployment and has disproportionately infected African Americans already had many simmering with rage and frustration, said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the National Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “The depths of despair are enormous right now for black people in this country,” she said. “You pile on unchecked police violence and it makes for a perfect storm.” – Rick Jervis Major cities across US impose curfews into Monday morning amid protests As cities where protests have erupted try to quell the demonstrations, several governors and mayors across the country imposed or extended curfews Sunday in anticipation of another night of unrest. More than 20 cities imposed some type of curfew. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced he would extend curfew for Minneapolis and St. Paul through Monday morning. Other cities that have announced curfews include Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Seattle and Louisville – where Breonna Taylor was killed . Donald Trump says he'll designate Antifa as a terror organization President Donald Trump announced Sunday a left-wing group he thinks is leading the violence at anti-police brutality protests will be officially labeled terrorists. ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,"" Trump said. Antifa – short for ""anti-fascist"" – is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups involved in some violent clashes in recent years. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership. – William Cummings and Kristine Phillips Crump: Officer may have known George Floyd before confrontation The lawyer for Floyd's family says the owner of a nightclub where Floyd worked notified the family his accused killer, Derek Chauvin, was an off-duty officer there. ""They had to overlap,"" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump told CBS's Face the Nation. ""And so that is going to be an interesting aspect to this case and hopefully upgrading these charges to first-degree murder because we believe he knew who George Floyd was."" Both worked security at the El Nuevo Rodeo, according to former owner Maya Santamaria. But Santamaria said they may not have known each other since Chauvin, as an off-duty police officer, worked outside, while Floyd worked inside. Crump said Floyd showed intent to kill by keeping his knee in Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes while Floyd was ""begging and pleading for breath,"" Crump said. 60 Secret Service agents injured in protests More than 60 Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters in Washington, D.C., on Friday and Saturday, the agency said. Some were assaulted, “kicked, punched and exposed to bodily fluids,” officials said. Eleven were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Officials said protesters vandalized six Secret Service vehicles, repeatedly tried to knock over security barriers, and threw bricks, rocks, bottles, fireworks and other items at Secret Service personnel. Seventeen people were arrested during protests Saturday night when organized groups “bent” on destruction took over the demonstration, Mayor Muriel Bowser said. – Kristine Phillips 1 dead in Chicago Six people were shot, and one was killed, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. More than 20 officers went to the hospital, and at least two required surgery, said Superintendent David Brown. Police made 240 arrests, Brown said. In a Sunday morning news conference, Lightfoot called Saturday night’s destruction downtown “devastating.” She said cars were set on fire and windows were smashed. “Is that how we bring social justice? Is that how we bring change? Certainly not,” she said. Lightfoot said, in addition to the city’s curfew, she was bringing in the Illinois National Guard and limiting access to the downtown Loop area, where protests took place. Lightfoot also said she was suspending transit services to the Loop. – Grace Hauck Minneapolis 'picking up a broom' No loss of life nor major fire damage was reported after bursts of violence that on Saturday night once again rocked Minneapolis, a city under siege of protests for almost a week, Mayor Jacob Frey said. ""The events of last night were obviously difficult to watch, but the restoration of order was important,"" Frey said at a news conference Sunday. Frey said he was encouraged to see residents ""coming out of their homes, picking up a broom"" to help sweep away the debris from nights of violence. Trump tweeted congratulations to the National Guard for the ""great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis."" The city planned to impose an 8 p.m. curfew Sunday. Frey pledged to make the state and city a better place for people of color. ""The action of one officer and the inaction of three officers have forever change our city,"" he said. ""We must become a better city. We must become a more just city."" Former police officer Chauvin could face additional charges, and officers at the scene of George Floyd's death are “not out of the woods,” Attorney General Ellison said Sunday. Chauvin's partner and two other officers who arrived on the scene as events unfolded have not been charged. Ellison, speaking on NBC's Meet the Press, said County Prosecutor Mike Freeman could charge the other officers with aiding and abetting, among other counts. 'Multiple shootings,' 2 fatalities in Indianapolis The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department confirmed two fatalities, and said it was investigating ""multiple"" shootings, none of which were officer-involved, after a second night of violence raged through parts of downtown. Clashes broke out in a haze of tear gas a little after 9 p.m., about two hours after city officials asked protest organizers to wrap up their events and clear the streets. Several protesters were arrested and widespread vandalism was reported in the aftermath. It was a far different scene earlier in the day, when thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully through Downtown streets chanting slogans such as ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No Justice – No Peace."" – Tim Evans, Indianapolis Star Mississippi mayor apologizes for George Floyd Twitter post A Mississippi mayor has apologized for social media posts that seemed to defend the behavior of Minneapolis police in Floyd's death. Petal Mayor Hal Marx, however, denied his comments were racist and said he won't resign. ""I admit that my comments on the recent tragic death of George Floyd in Minnesota were made in haste and not well-thought out or expressed,"" he said. He apologized to the city's 10,000 residents and anyone who might have been offended. The post, which he deleted from Twitter, said, ""if you can say you can’t breathe, you’re breathing. Most likely that man died of overdose or heart attack. Video doesn’t show his resistance that got him in that position. Police being crucified."" – Lici Beveridge, Mississippi Clarion-Ledger 4 officers, 3 journalists injured in Pittsburgh Four police officers and three local journalists were injured by protesters in Pittsburgh, the city Public Safety Department said. At least two police cars were set ablaze, as was an American flag, police said. Forty-three adults and one juvenile were arrested. State police were called in, and downtown property damage was ""extensive"" with dozens of businesses looted, the public safety department tweeted. Mayor Bill Peduto accused white, male ""anarchists"" of hijacking the protest. “To those vandalizing downtown, you will be arrested,” Peduto said. “You have turned on the very mission, and more importantly – the people, you supposedly marched for."" Read this:Minnesota officials say 'outside agitators' are hijacking peaceful protests. So, who are they? Police join protest in Alaska An ""I Can't Breathe"" rally on the waterfront in Juneau, Alaska, was joined by local residents, elected officials – and police officers. Floyd uttered ""I can't breathe"" multiple times in the moments before he died. Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer said he and other members of his department attended the rally to show solidarity with residents, saying he won't ""tolerate excessive use of force."" The rally featured Alaska Native songs performed by members of Yees Ku Oo dance group, a multi-cultural group from Juneau. “I’m here just to show that we are in this community and let people know that our voices matter and for people to stop killing us,” Jennifer Gross, an African-American woman, told the Juneau Empire. 'Don’t go out of your homes': Tough response in Twin Cities Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised to bring ""the full force of goodness and righteousness"" as law enforcement enforced a curfew in Minneapolis. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Walz said. As part of the state's increased enforcement, the Minnesota National Guard said more than 4,100 service members had been deployed to the Twin Cities and projected more than 10,000 would soon be called up. Several hours after the 8 p.m. curfew began Saturday, there were ""no reported injuries of consequence,"" Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told the media. Follow USA TODAY reporters Trevor Hughes and Tyler Davis for reports from the ground in the Twin Cities. Los Angeles mayor asks for National Guard amid violence In Los Angeles, police cars burned after thousands of protesters gathered at Pan Pacific Park spilled out into streets. Mayor Eric Garcetti asked for the National Guard to be sent in to the nation's second-largest city as protesters torched police cars and vandalized and burglarized stores while clashing with lines of officers. Garcetti said he asked Gov. Gavin Newsom for 500 to 700 members of the Guard. Elsewhere in California, a few hundred chanting demonstrators marched through San Francisco while northeast of San Diego, police fired tear gas to try to break up a large group that defied orders to leave the La Mesa police headquarters. Fires at courthouse and City Hall building in Nashville Fires in Nashville led Mayor John Cooper to declare a state of civil emergency Saturday night. Police announced a 10 p.m. curfew for the city, and Gov. Bill Lee deployed the National Guard. Dozens of protesters had gathered on the steps of Nashville's criminal courthouse and City Hall after a rally and march. Demonstrators smashed windows with rocks and other materials, drawing a swarm of police. The situation at the building appeared to subside around 7:30 p.m. By 8:15 p.m., fire was visible from a first-floor office at the courthouse. A short time later, police with riot gear arrived as a fire burned inside a window at City Hall. Officers deployed tear gas as demonstrators clustered in the center of Public Square Park. — Staff of The Tennessean Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

The turbulence sparked by the death of George Floyd — a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes — shook not only the streets of New York and Los Angeles, but dozens of smaller communities such as Fargo, North Dakota, and Lincoln, Nebraska. The damage extended even to buildings near the White House. ""They keep killing our people,"" said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston on Sunday. ""I'm so sick and tired of it."" Peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people on Saturday gave way, in some places, to violence, with police vehicles torched, stores emptied and objects hurled at officers. The police response varied from restrained to aggressive, with officers at times firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Police and peaceful protesters alike pleaded for a stop to violence, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. ""It only hurts the cause,"" said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed the heart of the city. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. ""Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,"" said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. ""Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning."" The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Minneapolis, police, state troopers and National Guard members showed new force Saturday in breaking up demonstrations after three days of police largely avoiding engaging protesters. Dozens of protests were underway or expected Sunday, from Miami to Kansas City to San Francisco. They went forth largely without incident, but sparks of crime continued. In Philadelphia, people robbed stores in broad daylight, and at least one more police vehicle was set ablaze. Streets leading downtown were closed. Chicago likewise restricted downtown access and called in the National Guard. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a ""sacred space."" The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. Among those descending on Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. ""I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,"" he said. County Commissioner Angela Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. ""We'll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,"" Conley said. In tweets Sunday, President Donald Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at ""far left extremist"" groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. Few parts of America were untouched. Protesters set fires inside Reno's city hall, and police launched tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. By Sunday, the fury had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London's Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In New York, a video Saturday showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. ""The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. Buildings around the U.S. were defaced with spray-painted messages, from the facade of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd's gasped last words — ""I can't breathe"" — were repeated, alongside anti-police messages. Crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. Some leaders prepared to put more soldiers in the streets. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to Athens, Savannah and any other cities where more demonstrations were planned. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses have yet to approach the staggering totals LA saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.",0.0

""This can be kind of a tinderbox for COVID,"" the 39-year-old venture capitalist said after attending a demonstration in Florida, one of many around the country sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. As more beaches, churches, mosques, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, the sudden and mass civil unrest in the United States is raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. And it's not just in the U.S. — London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday where demonstrators violated social distancing rules. Rosa Jimenez Cano said she planned to self-quarantine for 14 days, worrying she was perhaps ""irresponsible"" when she attended Saturday night's protest in Miami, where she exposed herself to crowds of people. Protests over Floyd's death — the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America — have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. ""There's no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets ... it's not healthy,"" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""Two weeks from now across America, we're going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not."" The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was very concerned that the protests in the nation's capital and elsewhere could provide fertile ground for a new series of outbreaks. Many of the protesters were wearing masks, but there were no attempts at social distancing. ""We've been working very hard in these last eight to 10 weeks to not have any mass gatherings,"" she said. ""As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound."" Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd's death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting ""No justice! No peace!"" while carrying signs reading ""Justice for George Floyd"" and ""Racism is a global issue."" Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: ""Justice for George Floyd."" Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam's holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Sunday that he would ask Parliament for a final two-week extension of the nation's state of emergency that is set to expire on June 7. That allows the government to keep ordering lockdown measures to control its coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 27,000 lives, many of them in overwhelmed nursing homes. ""We have almost reached safe harbor,"" Sánchez said. At the Vatican, Pope Francis cautioned people against being pessimistic as they emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter's Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that ""nothing will return as before."" That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that ""the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.""",0.0

Chattanooga Police said afterward the tear gas was thrown by the Sheriff's Office and not the city police. City Police also said they were not given warning that the tear gas was going to be used. In another tense night in downtown Chattanooga, some in the group knocked off a light post at the historic building, prompting the move to force them down. A witness said, ""They were on the steps of the courthouse on the jail side on Walnut Street. Some of the protesters went to the top of the steps and were pulling on a banner that was strung between two light posts. ""The posts were not very well supported and one started teetering when they were pulling on the banner. The original intent did not appear to be vandalism other than taking down the banner.   ""Law enforcement ran up the stairs and threw the two to the ground and handcuffed them. People got upset.    ""Some of them started approaching the officers. Many, many more officers came up the steps to hold them back. There was a little tussle at one point, but then everyone was staying back while officers were pointing very large guns at the crowd - maybe rubber bullet guns? maybe tear gas?   ""Then a couple of minutes later they fired the tear gas and everyone dispersed temporarily and went back around to the other side of the courthouse.""   Just as quickly, the protestors headed back toward Coolidge Park, where speakers on bullhorns had been denouncing the action of Minneapolis Police in the death of George Floyd. A number of those in the crowd held signs denouncing racism. In North Chattanooga as midnight approached, members of the National Guard joined with law enforcement at the intersection of Market Street and Frazier Avenue. They stood at the edge of the street holding weapons and wearing riot gear. Protestors milled around and periodically there were sounds that appeared to be fireworks that startled the crowd. Earlier in the standoff at the courthouse on the Georgia Avenue side, protestors on their knees had chanted ""Hands Up. Don't Shoot."" There was an earlier protest on Sunday afternoon at the County Courthouse with local activist Marie Mott exhorting a small group. Mayor Andy Berke, who had not commented following a night of violence and 11 arrests on Saturday, issued this statement on Sunday night, “We encourage everyone in Chattanooga to exercise their First Amendment rights and express themselves in a safe way.” Following incidents of violence in downtown Nashville, Governor Bill Lee announced Sunday that the Tennessee National Guard will remain mobilized across the state and that the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, in coordination with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement authorities, will launch an investigation into unlawful incidents that occurred overnight. “The right to peaceful protest is foundational to our country, but the violence and vandalism that occurred in Nashville last night was unlawful and tears at the fabric of our community,” said Governor Lee. “We have reason to believe that many of those involved in unlawful acts are not Tennesseans and we will be working with law enforcement to investigate this further and bring those responsible to justice.” National Guard personnel are now mobilized across all three Grand Divisions to assist state and local law enforcement. The Tennessee National Guard stands ready, in partnership with local law enforcement, the Department of Safety, and TEMA, to ensure order and safety are maintained in the supported areas for as long as is warranted by the situation. In addition to support from the Guard, Governor Lee has authorized the continuation of a curfew in Nashville and will support similar measures in other Tennessee cities as requested. Curfew in the downtown Nashville area and Urban Services District of Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County will be effective 8 p.m. CDT on Sunday and will continue until 6 a.m. CDT on Monday. The curfew will not apply to law enforcement and fire department personnel, first responders, and other officials assisting with maintaining public safety, including medical personnel in the performance of their duties, and any other persons lawfully on the streets and in public places with permission from law enforcement personnel. Governor Bill Lee also issued the following statement: “The protests in Murfreesboro are no longer peaceful demonstrations but have escalated to overt threats to public safety and property. I support Mayor McFarland’s 7 p.m. curfew and have authorized both the Tennessee Highway Patrol and the National Guard to provide support on the ground in restoring order for the safety of our citizens.”   ",0.0

Boyd, a Jackson native, and hundreds of other Tennesseans, utilized their First Amendment right to the fullest Sunday evening, speaking out against police brutality. This outcry is in response to the recent death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. “So we know that we had an arrest with the police officer who kneeled down on George Floyd. However, he was not the only one. We have several other police officers who also need to be held accountable for their actions,” Boyd said. Boyd organized protests in Jackson over the weekend. On Sunday, he wore a vest bearing a message. “This is a bullet-proof vest. It says, ‘Police, I am a white woman. Please don’t shoot.’ The purpose and the message behind this: you don’t hear about white women getting gunned down by the police, and today if I need to be a white woman so that I’m not shot, I’m okay with that,” Boyd said. “We’re seeking justice for George Floyd. We’re seeking justice for Breonna Taylor. We’re seeking justice for Philando Castile. Everyone that has been affected by this system, this is what that’s for.” Other leaders of Jackson stepped up to join protesters during their cry out for justice. “We have a wonderful mayor. We have a wonderful chief of police, Chief Wiser. He’s all for protest, he’s all for peaceful protest, and that’s what this simply is,” Boyd said. Jackson attorney Marcus Lipham and his wife Shayla set up food outside their law office for protesters. “He woke me up and said, ‘Hey, do you want to change the world today?’ and I was like, ‘What do you mean?’ ‘Let’s go downtown and feed everybody,’ and I was like okay,” Shayla Lipham said. “We’re doing it right. Nobody fights at a barbecue, nobody burns things down,” Marcus Lipham said. Protester Cody Doss said, as a white man, it’s vital that he speaks up during times like this. “Mostly just to be vocal because at the end of the day, minorities are minority and you need votes, you need majority, to make change you know,” Doss said. The officer who had his knee on Floyd’s neck has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The other three officers have been fired and are under investigation.",0.0

Murfreesboro Daily News Journal A California police chief kneeled with protesters. Law enforcement and elected officials joined protesters in Alaska. And police officers in Kansas City, Missouri, held a sign at a protest that read, ""END POLICE BRUTALITY!!!"" As local leaders joined protesters across the nation to show solidarity in the wake of the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in the custody of Minneapolis police on Memorial Day, the #WalkWithUs hashtag has blossomed on social media. ""We're looking for those in power that have the ability to make legislative and political changes to the way black and brown communities are treated in this country. We're looking for them to exercise their power,"" Marc Banks, national press secretary for the NAACP, told USA TODAY on Sunday. In Murfreesboro, after a demonstration that grew tense enough on Sunday for police to throw tear gas at a small crowd, a pair of officers and protesters were seen hugging to wrap up the day. GEORGE FLOYD: 'What the hell are you doing?': Tennessee law enforcement leaders react to Floyd's death Members of the Yees Ku Oo dance group, a multicultural group from Juneau, Alaska, performed during an ""I Can't Breathe"" rally in the city. Police Chief Ed Mercer said he and other members of his department attended the rally to show solidarity with residents, saying he won't ""tolerate excessive use of force.""

(Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press - USA TODAY Network) In Denver, Mayor Michael Hancock and Police Chief Paul Pazen encouraged citizens to protest despite the violence the night before when 13 protesters were arrested and three officers were injured. ""I, along with members of this department, send our condolences to the family and loved ones of George Floyd,"" Pazen said. ""Our heart hurts just as much as this community and the community in Minnesota."" Thousands of people peacefully protested in four New Jersey cities this weekend. The civil rights group People's Organization for Progress organized a protest in Newark with the help of local officials. 'We can't just sit on the sidelines anymore': Peaceful protesters lament violence at George Floyd demonstrations, but understand the rage behind it ""People would have thought something was wrong if there was no rally,"" said Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who has marched with the group long before taking office. A similar protest was organized with the Miami-Dade Chiefs of Police Association in Coral Gables, where officers were seen taking a knee, according to TV station WPEC. The chiefs association has committed to meet with organizers via Zoom to listen to the community's concerns, WPEC reported. There were other examples, too. In Petersburg, Virginia, at least three police officers stood with protesters at Saturday gathering, ABC8 reported. “They’re talking about justice, that we totally stand for,” Petersburg Police Chief Kenneth Miller told the station. “They are tired — America is tired."" A 'perfect storm' of civil unrest: Why George Floyd's death is unique, effective, experts say And, in Atlanta, a video posted to Twitter showed Chief of Police Erika Shields on the streets talking to protesters, including a black woman who shared concerns for her safety. ""It does not matter what I do because they see my skin. I need you to understand that. I need you to do something and if you do something, you need to let the public know,"" the woman told Shields. Shields responded: ""Let me tell you something, I am standing here because what I saw was my people face-to-face with this crowd and everybody’s thinking, ‘How can we use force and diffuse this’ and I’m not having it. I’m not having that,"" said Shields. “You have a right to be upset, to be scared, and to want to yell. And we’re going to have everybody doing what they need to do and we’re going to do it safely. That’s my first commitment. And I hear you,” Shields told the woman. Once protests settle, Banks said he hopes those officials, and, some at the federal level, will work with community members and organizations to implement policy changes to address systematic racism.

Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing the family of Floyd, said the police officer who pressed his knee on the man's neck may have known him and should be charged with first-degree murder. Officer Derek Chauvin was charged with second-degree manslaughter and third-degree murder and fired last week, days after the confrontation. Amid urging by Floyd family members and Minneapolis leaders, Gov. Tim Walz named state Attorney General Keith Ellison as special prosecutor to examine Floyd's death. In Chicago, one of dozens of cities dealing with sometimes-violent protests, more than 20 police officers were injured, dozens of buildings were damaged and several vehicles burned Saturday night. On Saturday's National Day of Protest, tens of thousands of people took to the streets. Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta were among cities enacting curfews to quell the upheaval prompted by Floyd's death, racial inequities and police brutality. In New York, fires burned, and a video shared on social media appeared to show a police car driving into a crowd of protesters. Some journalists covering the demonstrations were injured by tear gas, smoke bombs and nonlethal projectiles fired by police. In Pittsburgh at least three local journalists were injured by protesters, police said. Resources, ways to donate: How you can take action from home Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. Here are the latest developments: Minneapolis police chief: Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN in an interview George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. The killing of Mr. Floyd was an absolute truth that it was wrong. I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on -- this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to lead prosecution Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it – at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.” Semi-truck driver hospitalized, arrested after 'inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators' The Minnesota Department of Public Safety confirmed a semi-truck driver was hospitalized and arrested after video surfaced showing protesters scattering after a truck drove into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators on Interstate 35. The Department of Public Safety called the driver's actions ""very disturbing"" and added the driver was ""inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators."" Videos from the scene showed an 18-wheeler driving toward a large crowd of fleeing protesters before coming to a stop. The demonstrators converged on the truck after it stopped. ""The truck driver was injured & taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries,"" the Department of Public Safety tweeted. ""He is under arrest. It doesn’t appear any protesters were hit by the truck."" Cities nationwide brace for more protests After nights of chaos nationwide, cities braced for more protests in the wake of Floyd's death. Many protests have followed similar patterns – there's peace at first, but things eventually turn for the worse, typically at night. In Santa Monica, California, for example there was peaceful protest where hundreds gathered, marched and took a knee for more than two minutes. However, there were also reports of looting. A video on social media showed a woman attempting to stop looters from breaking into a store. Other cities also had peaceful demonstrations early and late afternoon Sunday. In Minneapolis, the epicenter of the protests, there was a sense of calm. Volunteer crews cleaned up broken glass and rubble left behind following widespread looting and protesting. In a change from previous days, city public works crews helped managed the process, which was undertaken primarily by volunteers. Still, some believed there was more damage to come. So far, just one of the four officers involved in the incident that ended with Floyd's death has been charged. Minneapolis residents want charges for the other three. 'We’re here to make a difference': Protesters return to White House Hundreds of protesters returned to the White House on Sunday, a day after demonstrations turned violent and police used tear gas to dispel crowds in Lafayette Park. The park was shuttered Sunday and nearby buildings remained boarded up, but police and members of U.S. Secret Service lined the facade of the White House as demonstrations carried on just outside the entrance at 16th and H streets. Clutching signs that read, “end police brutality” and “peace, but not patience. We need change now,” protesters chanted and clapped as the crowds swelled in the late afternoon sun. Amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, most people in the crowd wore face-coverings. – Courtney Subramanian, David Jackson and Kristine Phillips 'Perfect storm' of civil unrest following Floyd's death, experts say Why did Floyd’s death spark such widespread, visceral outrage, while three other deaths of African Americans this year – Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Tony McDade, a black transgender man killed by police officers in Tallahassee – did not? An array of combustible issues converged to form a “perfect storm” of civil unrest after Floyd’s death and could lead to longer-lasting changes, experts and protest organizers said. The coronavirus pandemic that has sequestered most Americans in their homes, forced millions into unemployment and has disproportionately infected African Americans already had many simmering with rage and frustration, said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the National Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “The depths of despair are enormous right now for black people in this country,” she said. “You pile on unchecked police violence and it makes for a perfect storm.” – Rick Jervis Major cities across US impose curfews into Monday morning amid protests As cities where protests have erupted try to quell the demonstrations, several governors and mayors across the country imposed or extended curfews Sunday in anticipation of another night of unrest. More than 20 cities imposed some type of curfew. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced he would extend curfew for Minneapolis and St. Paul through Monday morning. Other cities that have announced curfews include Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Seattle and Louisville – where Breonna Taylor was killed . Donald Trump says he'll designate Antifa as a terror organization President Donald Trump announced Sunday a left-wing group he thinks is leading the violence at anti-police brutality protests will be officially labeled terrorists. ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,"" Trump said. Antifa – short for ""anti-fascist"" – is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups involved in some violent clashes in recent years. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership. – William Cummings and Kristine Phillips Crump: Officer may have known George Floyd before confrontation The lawyer for Floyd's family says the owner of a nightclub where Floyd worked notified the family his accused killer, Derek Chauvin, was an off-duty officer there. ""They had to overlap,"" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump told CBS's Face the Nation. ""And so that is going to be an interesting aspect to this case and hopefully upgrading these charges to first-degree murder because we believe he knew who George Floyd was."" Both worked security at the El Nuevo Rodeo, according to former owner Maya Santamaria. But Santamaria said they may not have known each other since Chauvin, as an off-duty police officer, worked outside, while Floyd worked inside. Crump said Floyd showed intent to kill by keeping his knee in Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes while Floyd was ""begging and pleading for breath,"" Crump said. 60 Secret Service agents injured in protests More than 60 Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters in Washington, D.C., on Friday and Saturday, the agency said. Some were assaulted, “kicked, punched and exposed to bodily fluids,” officials said. Eleven were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Officials said protesters vandalized six Secret Service vehicles, repeatedly tried to knock over security barriers, and threw bricks, rocks, bottles, fireworks and other items at Secret Service personnel. Seventeen people were arrested during protests Saturday night when organized groups “bent” on destruction took over the demonstration, Mayor Muriel Bowser said. – Kristine Phillips 1 dead in Chicago Six people were shot, and one was killed, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. More than 20 officers went to the hospital, and at least two required surgery, said Superintendent David Brown. Police made 240 arrests, Brown said. In a Sunday morning news conference, Lightfoot called Saturday night’s destruction downtown “devastating.” She said cars were set on fire and windows were smashed. “Is that how we bring social justice? Is that how we bring change? Certainly not,” she said. Lightfoot said, in addition to the city’s curfew, she was bringing in the Illinois National Guard and limiting access to the downtown Loop area, where protests took place. Lightfoot also said she was suspending transit services to the Loop. – Grace Hauck Minneapolis 'picking up a broom' No loss of life nor major fire damage was reported after bursts of violence that on Saturday night once again rocked Minneapolis, a city under siege of protests for almost a week, Mayor Jacob Frey said. ""The events of last night were obviously difficult to watch, but the restoration of order was important,"" Frey said at a news conference Sunday. Frey said he was encouraged to see residents ""coming out of their homes, picking up a broom"" to help sweep away the debris from nights of violence. Trump tweeted congratulations to the National Guard for the ""great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis."" The city planned to impose an 8 p.m. curfew Sunday. Frey pledged to make the state and city a better place for people of color. ""The action of one officer and the inaction of three officers have forever change our city,"" he said. ""We must become a better city. We must become a more just city."" Former police officer Chauvin could face additional charges, and officers at the scene of George Floyd's death are “not out of the woods,” Attorney General Ellison said Sunday. Chauvin's partner and two other officers who arrived on the scene as events unfolded have not been charged. Ellison, speaking on NBC's Meet the Press, said County Prosecutor Mike Freeman could charge the other officers with aiding and abetting, among other counts. 'Multiple shootings,' 2 fatalities in Indianapolis The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department confirmed two fatalities, and said it was investigating ""multiple"" shootings, none of which were officer-involved, after a second night of violence raged through parts of downtown. Clashes broke out in a haze of tear gas a little after 9 p.m., about two hours after city officials asked protest organizers to wrap up their events and clear the streets. Several protesters were arrested and widespread vandalism was reported in the aftermath. It was a far different scene earlier in the day, when thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully through Downtown streets chanting slogans such as ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No Justice – No Peace."" – Tim Evans, Indianapolis Star Mississippi mayor apologizes for George Floyd Twitter post A Mississippi mayor has apologized for social media posts that seemed to defend the behavior of Minneapolis police in Floyd's death. Petal Mayor Hal Marx, however, denied his comments were racist and said he won't resign. ""I admit that my comments on the recent tragic death of George Floyd in Minnesota were made in haste and not well-thought out or expressed,"" he said. He apologized to the city's 10,000 residents and anyone who might have been offended. The post, which he deleted from Twitter, said, ""if you can say you can’t breathe, you’re breathing. Most likely that man died of overdose or heart attack. Video doesn’t show his resistance that got him in that position. Police being crucified."" – Lici Beveridge, Mississippi Clarion-Ledger 4 officers, 3 journalists injured in Pittsburgh Four police officers and three local journalists were injured by protesters in Pittsburgh, the city Public Safety Department said. At least two police cars were set ablaze, as was an American flag, police said. Forty-three adults and one juvenile were arrested. State police were called in, and downtown property damage was ""extensive"" with dozens of businesses looted, the public safety department tweeted. Mayor Bill Peduto accused white, male ""anarchists"" of hijacking the protest. “To those vandalizing downtown, you will be arrested,” Peduto said. “You have turned on the very mission, and more importantly – the people, you supposedly marched for."" Read this:Minnesota officials say 'outside agitators' are hijacking peaceful protests. So, who are they? Police join protest in Alaska An ""I Can't Breathe"" rally on the waterfront in Juneau, Alaska, was joined by local residents, elected officials – and police officers. Floyd uttered ""I can't breathe"" multiple times in the moments before he died. Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer said he and other members of his department attended the rally to show solidarity with residents, saying he won't ""tolerate excessive use of force."" The rally featured Alaska Native songs performed by members of Yees Ku Oo dance group, a multi-cultural group from Juneau. “I’m here just to show that we are in this community and let people know that our voices matter and for people to stop killing us,” Jennifer Gross, an African-American woman, told the Juneau Empire. 'Don’t go out of your homes': Tough response in Twin Cities Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised to bring ""the full force of goodness and righteousness"" as law enforcement enforced a curfew in Minneapolis. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Walz said. As part of the state's increased enforcement, the Minnesota National Guard said more than 4,100 service members had been deployed to the Twin Cities and projected more than 10,000 would soon be called up. Several hours after the 8 p.m. curfew began Saturday, there were ""no reported injuries of consequence,"" Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told the media. Follow USA TODAY reporters Trevor Hughes and Tyler Davis for reports from the ground in the Twin Cities. Los Angeles mayor asks for National Guard amid violence In Los Angeles, police cars burned after thousands of protesters gathered at Pan Pacific Park spilled out into streets. Mayor Eric Garcetti asked for the National Guard to be sent in to the nation's second-largest city as protesters torched police cars and vandalized and burglarized stores while clashing with lines of officers. Garcetti said he asked Gov. Gavin Newsom for 500 to 700 members of the Guard. Elsewhere in California, a few hundred chanting demonstrators marched through San Francisco while northeast of San Diego, police fired tear gas to try to break up a large group that defied orders to leave the La Mesa police headquarters. Fires at courthouse and City Hall building in Nashville Fires in Nashville led Mayor John Cooper to declare a state of civil emergency Saturday night. Police announced a 10 p.m. curfew for the city, and Gov. Bill Lee deployed the National Guard. Dozens of protesters had gathered on the steps of Nashville's criminal courthouse and City Hall after a rally and march. Demonstrators smashed windows with rocks and other materials, drawing a swarm of police. The situation at the building appeared to subside around 7:30 p.m. By 8:15 p.m., fire was visible from a first-floor office at the courthouse. A short time later, police with riot gear arrived as a fire burned inside a window at City Hall. Officers deployed tear gas as demonstrators clustered in the center of Public Square Park. — Staff of The Tennessean Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

And police officers in Kansas City, Missouri, held a sign at a protest that read, ""END POLICE BRUTALITY!!!"" As local leaders joined protesters across the nation to show solidarity in the wake of the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in the custody of Minneapolis police on Memorial Day, the #WalkWithUs hashtag has blossomed on social media. ""We're looking for those in power that have the ability to make legislative and political changes to the way black and brown communities are treated in this country. We're looking for them to exercise their power,"" Marc Banks, national press secretary for the NAACP, told USA TODAY on Sunday. In Murfreesboro, after a demonstration that grew tense enough on Sunday for police to throw tear gas at a small crowd, a pair of officers and protesters were seen hugging to wrap up the day. GEORGE FLOYD: 'What the hell are you doing?': Tennessee law enforcement leaders react to Floyd's death Members of the Yees Ku Oo dance group, a multicultural group from Juneau, Alaska, performed during an ""I Can't Breathe"" rally in the city. Police Chief Ed Mercer said he and other members of his department attended the rally to show solidarity with residents, saying he won't ""tolerate excessive use of force.""

(Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press - USA TODAY Network) In Denver, Mayor Michael Hancock and Police Chief Paul Pazen encouraged citizens to protest despite the violence the night before when 13 protesters were arrested and three officers were injured. ""I, along with members of this department, send our condolences to the family and loved ones of George Floyd,"" Pazen said. ""Our heart hurts just as much as this community and the community in Minnesota."" Thousands of people peacefully protested in four New Jersey cities this weekend. The civil rights group People's Organization for Progress organized a protest in Newark with the help of local officials. 'We can't just sit on the sidelines anymore': Peaceful protesters lament violence at George Floyd demonstrations, but understand the rage behind it ""People would have thought something was wrong if there was no rally,"" said Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who has marched with the group long before taking office. A similar protest was organized with the Miami-Dade Chiefs of Police Association in Coral Gables, where officers were seen taking a knee, according to TV station WPEC. The chiefs association has committed to meet with organizers via Zoom to listen to the community's concerns, WPEC reported. There were other examples, too. In Petersburg, Virginia, at least three police officers stood with protesters at Saturday gathering, ABC8 reported. “They’re talking about justice, that we totally stand for,” Petersburg Police Chief Kenneth Miller told the station. “They are tired — America is tired."" A 'perfect storm' of civil unrest: Why George Floyd's death is unique, effective, experts say And, in Atlanta, a video posted to Twitter showed Chief of Police Erika Shields on the streets talking to protesters, including a black woman who shared concerns for her safety. ""It does not matter what I do because they see my skin. I need you to understand that. I need you to do something and if you do something, you need to let the public know,"" the woman told Shields. Shields responded: ""Let me tell you something, I am standing here because what I saw was my people face-to-face with this crowd and everybody’s thinking, ‘How can we use force and diffuse this’ and I’m not having it. I’m not having that,"" said Shields. “You have a right to be upset, to be scared, and to want to yell. And we’re going to have everybody doing what they need to do and we’re going to do it safely. That’s my first commitment. And I hear you,” Shields told the woman. Once protests settle, Banks said he hopes those officials, and, some at the federal level, will work with community members and organizations to implement policy changes to address systematic racism.

Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing the family of Floyd, said the police officer who pressed his knee on the man's neck may have known him and should be charged with first-degree murder. Officer Derek Chauvin was charged with second-degree manslaughter and third-degree murder and fired last week, days after the confrontation. Amid urging by Floyd family members and Minneapolis leaders, Gov. Tim Walz named state Attorney General Keith Ellison as special prosecutor to examine Floyd's death. In Chicago, one of dozens of cities dealing with sometimes-violent protests, more than 20 police officers were injured, dozens of buildings were damaged and several vehicles burned Saturday night. On Saturday's National Day of Protest, tens of thousands of people took to the streets. Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta were among cities enacting curfews to quell the upheaval prompted by Floyd's death, racial inequities and police brutality. In New York, fires burned, and a video shared on social media appeared to show a police car driving into a crowd of protesters. Some journalists covering the demonstrations were injured by tear gas, smoke bombs and nonlethal projectiles fired by police. In Pittsburgh at least three local journalists were injured by protesters, police said. Resources, ways to donate: How you can take action from home Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. Here are the latest developments: Minneapolis police chief: Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN in an interview George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. The killing of Mr. Floyd was an absolute truth that it was wrong. I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on -- this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to lead prosecution Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it – at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.” Semi-truck driver hospitalized, arrested after 'inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators' The Minnesota Department of Public Safety confirmed a semi-truck driver was hospitalized and arrested after video surfaced showing protesters scattering after a truck drove into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators on Interstate 35. The Department of Public Safety called the driver's actions ""very disturbing"" and added the driver was ""inciting a crowd of peaceful demonstrators."" Videos from the scene showed an 18-wheeler driving toward a large crowd of fleeing protesters before coming to a stop. The demonstrators converged on the truck after it stopped. ""The truck driver was injured & taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries,"" the Department of Public Safety tweeted. ""He is under arrest. It doesn’t appear any protesters were hit by the truck."" Cities nationwide brace for more protests After nights of chaos nationwide, cities braced for more protests in the wake of Floyd's death. Many protests have followed similar patterns – there's peace at first, but things eventually turn for the worse, typically at night. In Santa Monica, California, for example there was peaceful protest where hundreds gathered, marched and took a knee for more than two minutes. However, there were also reports of looting. A video on social media showed a woman attempting to stop looters from breaking into a store. Other cities also had peaceful demonstrations early and late afternoon Sunday. In Minneapolis, the epicenter of the protests, there was a sense of calm. Volunteer crews cleaned up broken glass and rubble left behind following widespread looting and protesting. In a change from previous days, city public works crews helped managed the process, which was undertaken primarily by volunteers. Still, some believed there was more damage to come. So far, just one of the four officers involved in the incident that ended with Floyd's death has been charged. Minneapolis residents want charges for the other three. 'We’re here to make a difference': Protesters return to White House Hundreds of protesters returned to the White House on Sunday, a day after demonstrations turned violent and police used tear gas to dispel crowds in Lafayette Park. The park was shuttered Sunday and nearby buildings remained boarded up, but police and members of U.S. Secret Service lined the facade of the White House as demonstrations carried on just outside the entrance at 16th and H streets. Clutching signs that read, “end police brutality” and “peace, but not patience. We need change now,” protesters chanted and clapped as the crowds swelled in the late afternoon sun. Amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, most people in the crowd wore face-coverings. – Courtney Subramanian, David Jackson and Kristine Phillips 'Perfect storm' of civil unrest following Floyd's death, experts say Why did Floyd’s death spark such widespread, visceral outrage, while three other deaths of African Americans this year – Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and Tony McDade, a black transgender man killed by police officers in Tallahassee – did not? An array of combustible issues converged to form a “perfect storm” of civil unrest after Floyd’s death and could lead to longer-lasting changes, experts and protest organizers said. The coronavirus pandemic that has sequestered most Americans in their homes, forced millions into unemployment and has disproportionately infected African Americans already had many simmering with rage and frustration, said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the National Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “The depths of despair are enormous right now for black people in this country,” she said. “You pile on unchecked police violence and it makes for a perfect storm.” – Rick Jervis Major cities across US impose curfews into Monday morning amid protests As cities where protests have erupted try to quell the demonstrations, several governors and mayors across the country imposed or extended curfews Sunday in anticipation of another night of unrest. More than 20 cities imposed some type of curfew. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced he would extend curfew for Minneapolis and St. Paul through Monday morning. Other cities that have announced curfews include Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Seattle and Louisville – where Breonna Taylor was killed . Donald Trump says he'll designate Antifa as a terror organization President Donald Trump announced Sunday a left-wing group he thinks is leading the violence at anti-police brutality protests will be officially labeled terrorists. ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,"" Trump said. Antifa – short for ""anti-fascist"" – is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups involved in some violent clashes in recent years. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership. – William Cummings and Kristine Phillips Crump: Officer may have known George Floyd before confrontation The lawyer for Floyd's family says the owner of a nightclub where Floyd worked notified the family his accused killer, Derek Chauvin, was an off-duty officer there. ""They had to overlap,"" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump told CBS's Face the Nation. ""And so that is going to be an interesting aspect to this case and hopefully upgrading these charges to first-degree murder because we believe he knew who George Floyd was."" Both worked security at the El Nuevo Rodeo, according to former owner Maya Santamaria. But Santamaria said they may not have known each other since Chauvin, as an off-duty police officer, worked outside, while Floyd worked inside. Crump said Floyd showed intent to kill by keeping his knee in Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes while Floyd was ""begging and pleading for breath,"" Crump said. 60 Secret Service agents injured in protests More than 60 Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters in Washington, D.C., on Friday and Saturday, the agency said. Some were assaulted, “kicked, punched and exposed to bodily fluids,” officials said. Eleven were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Officials said protesters vandalized six Secret Service vehicles, repeatedly tried to knock over security barriers, and threw bricks, rocks, bottles, fireworks and other items at Secret Service personnel. Seventeen people were arrested during protests Saturday night when organized groups “bent” on destruction took over the demonstration, Mayor Muriel Bowser said. – Kristine Phillips 1 dead in Chicago Six people were shot, and one was killed, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. More than 20 officers went to the hospital, and at least two required surgery, said Superintendent David Brown. Police made 240 arrests, Brown said. In a Sunday morning news conference, Lightfoot called Saturday night’s destruction downtown “devastating.” She said cars were set on fire and windows were smashed. “Is that how we bring social justice? Is that how we bring change? Certainly not,” she said. Lightfoot said, in addition to the city’s curfew, she was bringing in the Illinois National Guard and limiting access to the downtown Loop area, where protests took place. Lightfoot also said she was suspending transit services to the Loop. – Grace Hauck Minneapolis 'picking up a broom' No loss of life nor major fire damage was reported after bursts of violence that on Saturday night once again rocked Minneapolis, a city under siege of protests for almost a week, Mayor Jacob Frey said. ""The events of last night were obviously difficult to watch, but the restoration of order was important,"" Frey said at a news conference Sunday. Frey said he was encouraged to see residents ""coming out of their homes, picking up a broom"" to help sweep away the debris from nights of violence. Trump tweeted congratulations to the National Guard for the ""great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis."" The city planned to impose an 8 p.m. curfew Sunday. Frey pledged to make the state and city a better place for people of color. ""The action of one officer and the inaction of three officers have forever change our city,"" he said. ""We must become a better city. We must become a more just city."" Former police officer Chauvin could face additional charges, and officers at the scene of George Floyd's death are “not out of the woods,” Attorney General Ellison said Sunday. Chauvin's partner and two other officers who arrived on the scene as events unfolded have not been charged. Ellison, speaking on NBC's Meet the Press, said County Prosecutor Mike Freeman could charge the other officers with aiding and abetting, among other counts. 'Multiple shootings,' 2 fatalities in Indianapolis The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department confirmed two fatalities, and said it was investigating ""multiple"" shootings, none of which were officer-involved, after a second night of violence raged through parts of downtown. Clashes broke out in a haze of tear gas a little after 9 p.m., about two hours after city officials asked protest organizers to wrap up their events and clear the streets. Several protesters were arrested and widespread vandalism was reported in the aftermath. It was a far different scene earlier in the day, when thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully through Downtown streets chanting slogans such as ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No Justice – No Peace."" – Tim Evans, Indianapolis Star Mississippi mayor apologizes for George Floyd Twitter post A Mississippi mayor has apologized for social media posts that seemed to defend the behavior of Minneapolis police in Floyd's death. Petal Mayor Hal Marx, however, denied his comments were racist and said he won't resign. ""I admit that my comments on the recent tragic death of George Floyd in Minnesota were made in haste and not well-thought out or expressed,"" he said. He apologized to the city's 10,000 residents and anyone who might have been offended. The post, which he deleted from Twitter, said, ""if you can say you can’t breathe, you’re breathing. Most likely that man died of overdose or heart attack. Video doesn’t show his resistance that got him in that position. Police being crucified."" – Lici Beveridge, Mississippi Clarion-Ledger 4 officers, 3 journalists injured in Pittsburgh Four police officers and three local journalists were injured by protesters in Pittsburgh, the city Public Safety Department said. At least two police cars were set ablaze, as was an American flag, police said. Forty-three adults and one juvenile were arrested. State police were called in, and downtown property damage was ""extensive"" with dozens of businesses looted, the public safety department tweeted. Mayor Bill Peduto accused white, male ""anarchists"" of hijacking the protest. “To those vandalizing downtown, you will be arrested,” Peduto said. “You have turned on the very mission, and more importantly – the people, you supposedly marched for."" Read this:Minnesota officials say 'outside agitators' are hijacking peaceful protests. So, who are they? Police join protest in Alaska An ""I Can't Breathe"" rally on the waterfront in Juneau, Alaska, was joined by local residents, elected officials – and police officers. Floyd uttered ""I can't breathe"" multiple times in the moments before he died. Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer said he and other members of his department attended the rally to show solidarity with residents, saying he won't ""tolerate excessive use of force."" The rally featured Alaska Native songs performed by members of Yees Ku Oo dance group, a multi-cultural group from Juneau. “I’m here just to show that we are in this community and let people know that our voices matter and for people to stop killing us,” Jennifer Gross, an African-American woman, told the Juneau Empire. 'Don’t go out of your homes': Tough response in Twin Cities Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised to bring ""the full force of goodness and righteousness"" as law enforcement enforced a curfew in Minneapolis. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Walz said. As part of the state's increased enforcement, the Minnesota National Guard said more than 4,100 service members had been deployed to the Twin Cities and projected more than 10,000 would soon be called up. Several hours after the 8 p.m. curfew began Saturday, there were ""no reported injuries of consequence,"" Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told the media. Follow USA TODAY reporters Trevor Hughes and Tyler Davis for reports from the ground in the Twin Cities. Los Angeles mayor asks for National Guard amid violence In Los Angeles, police cars burned after thousands of protesters gathered at Pan Pacific Park spilled out into streets. Mayor Eric Garcetti asked for the National Guard to be sent in to the nation's second-largest city as protesters torched police cars and vandalized and burglarized stores while clashing with lines of officers. Garcetti said he asked Gov. Gavin Newsom for 500 to 700 members of the Guard. Elsewhere in California, a few hundred chanting demonstrators marched through San Francisco while northeast of San Diego, police fired tear gas to try to break up a large group that defied orders to leave the La Mesa police headquarters. Fires at courthouse and City Hall building in Nashville Fires in Nashville led Mayor John Cooper to declare a state of civil emergency Saturday night. Police announced a 10 p.m. curfew for the city, and Gov. Bill Lee deployed the National Guard. Dozens of protesters had gathered on the steps of Nashville's criminal courthouse and City Hall after a rally and march. Demonstrators smashed windows with rocks and other materials, drawing a swarm of police. The situation at the building appeared to subside around 7:30 p.m. By 8:15 p.m., fire was visible from a first-floor office at the courthouse. A short time later, police with riot gear arrived as a fire burned inside a window at City Hall. Officers deployed tear gas as demonstrators clustered in the center of Public Square Park. — Staff of The Tennessean Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

There have been protests and rallies in Knoxville, Morristown, Nashville and Memphis after a video of Floyd’s death also sparked protests all across the country. RELATED: Protests emerge across Tennessee after the death of George Floyd in Minnesota In Middle Tennessee, Governor Bill Lee mobilized the National Guard in Nashville as violence erupted during a protest late Saturday night. FILE – (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey, File) “At the request of Mayor Cooper, I am authorizing the National Guard to mobilize in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville. The threat to both peace and property is unacceptable and we will work with local law enforcement and community leaders to restore safety and order. This is not a reflection of our state or the fundamental American right to peaceful protest.” Governor Bill Lee FILE – State Sen. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge. Lieutenant Governor Randy McNally took to Twitter and said, “What is happening in Nashville is a descent into madness. This is not who we are. The outside agitators responsible for this mayhem should cease, desist and leave our state. The police are not perfect. Those who transgress against our citizens should be brought to justice.” McNally continued to say that law enforcement is the only thing keeping order amid the chaos, and that he supported Gov. Lee’s decision to mobilize the National Guard and the THP Strike Force. “This lawlessness is counterproductive and wrong. It needs to end tonight.” Lt. Governor Randy McNally Representative Chuck Fleischmann says that his heart breaks after seeing initially peaceful protests turn violent. ”Protestors who are peacefully exercising their first amendment right should be allowed to be heard.‪ Chief Deputy Austin Garrett, Chief David Roddy, Chattanooga Police Department, Hamilton County Sheriffs Office have shown incredible leadership.‪ I also want to applaud the work of our local journalists who are continuing to work around the clock to ensure our community stays informed WRCB Channel 3 Eyewitness News, News 12 Now, WTVC-TV News, Channel 9 News, Chattanooga Times Free Press, Knoxville News Sentinel, WATE 6 On Your Side, WVLT, and WBIR Channel 10‪.

Chuck Fleischmann Representative Tim Burchett also released a statement regarding the violence in Nashville and nationwide. “The killing of George Floyd was tragic, unnecessary and unacceptable. Communities of color, and in fact our entire nation, are right to be angry, and protesting peacefully and lawfully is an appropriate way to express that anger. Rioting, as we’ve seen across our country in recent days and in Nashville tonight is illegal and unworthy of being called a protest or a rally. Looting and damaging businesses, destroying private property, vandalizing and burning public buildings are acts that distract from the memory of George Floyd and the ongoing effort to eliminate racism in our country. Thankfully, in my hometown of Knoxville, protests yesterday were peaceful. Rather than uncontrolled opportunistic violence and looting, our country need to come together in unity and in prayer.” Rep. Tim Burchett At around 9:04 p.m. Saturday, Representative Jason Zachary took to Twitter, thanking law enforcement for the job they’re doing in Nashville. “Our @TNHighwayPatrol are risking their lives to protect our State Capitol from the criminals and vandals who are trashing Nashville.

The protests, which mostly began in a peaceful environment, later lead to incidents with the security forces, despite there being a curfew in at least 40 cities in the country and the deployment of the National Guard in 15 states and in Washington DC, the capital. The reason for the protests affecting dozens of cities across the country is the death of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis after he was restrained by a white policeman, already handcuffed, with his knee to his neck for several minutes, despite his pleas saying he couldn’t breathe. One of the most violent protests of the night took place in Washington, which began in front of the White House, where the protesters built bonfires, which later led to fires and confrontations with the police in neighboring areas. The District of Columbia Fire Department reported on its Twitter account about fires in the basement of St. John’s Episcopal Church, as well as at a facility located in Lafayette Square (the plaza in front of the presidential house) and in the AFL-CIO headquarters, the largest union platform in the country. And as has happened in other cities in recent days, after an attack on a patrol car on 14th Street, the police threw rubber balls and charged those present, including several journalists, including an EFE / EPA cameraman. As it happened, on Saturday, Trump referred to those riots in a tweet and attributed them to “totally professional” troublemakers, as Antifa members often allude to. “The United States of America will designate ANTIFA as a terrorist organization,” Trump tweeted this Sunday when thousands of people were already preparing to protest again for the death of the African American Floyd last Monday in Minneapolis (Minnesota) when he was being detained by the police. Attorney General William Barr also said in a statement that he will order the FBI’s Joint Task Force to identify “radical groups and outside agitators” who take advantage of these protests to “pursue their own agenda.” “The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the riots is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly,” Barr warned. The American anti-fascist movement, known as ANTIFA, is a small but noisy radical group that, after Trump’s arrival in the White House, has become increasingly active, especially to counter the protests of white supremacists. Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked why the FBI does not treat white supremacists, groups who are sympathetic to Trump as internal terrorism groups. Also the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) criticized Trump’s announcement and said that “it does not have the legal authority to designate a group as an internal (terrorist group).” The US Government has a list of international organizations and countries that it considers to be terrorists, but there is no internal terrorism statute. In Los Angeles, the city that advanced the curfew to avoid incidents, while marches were taking place to protest Floyd’s death, there were organized groups that moved by car, starting looting after breaking business windows. As EFE could verify, the violent acts happened at the same time that hundreds of protesters protested peacefully in nearby streets, with minutes of silence in honor of Floyd. In the case of Los Angeles, the tense situation is reminiscent of the violent riots that in 1992 resulted in more than 50 deaths and 2,000 injuries, after another famous case of police brutality against an African American citizen. And in Minneapolis, where these protests originated, security forces arrested some 150 protesters on Sunday who defied the curfew, on the first night without violence since the riot broke out. social. Unlike Saturday, when police and the military used force to disperse the protests, the strategy this Sunday was to completely surround the group, which, seeing no way out, simply gave up.

(AP) — Protesters and police officers clashed anew Sunday in Tennessee as demonstrations were held across the state in response to the death of George Floyd, sparking strict curfews and mobilization of National Guard troops in a handful of areas. In Memphis, protesters made it onto Interstate 55, circumventing officers in riot gear who sought to block the group from getting on the artery near downtown Memphis. Protesters chanted “Black lives matter” and “George Floyd,” standing side by side to block vehicles as officers held clubs and pepper spray. The group walked on the interstate before making its way back to the downtown area and the famed Beale Street, where protesters were met by officers wearing helmets and holding protective shields in front of the FedExForum, the NBA basketball arena and concert venue. The demonstration marked the fifth night in a row people had met in Memphis to protest the death of Floyd, a black man who died last week after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck as Floyd pleaded for air. The night before, Memphis police faced a standoff with a crowd after a peaceful demonstration was held at the National Civil Rights Museum. Memphis police said protesters threw bottles at officers, who dispersed the crowd near Beale Street, the historic tourist district known for its blues bars. Police said people fired shots at officers on two different occasions at other locations early Sunday. No officers were hit. A total of eight people were arrested. Protest organizers claim police escalated Saturday’s incident on Beale Street, which came two hours after the peaceful protest ended. Elsewhere, Gov. Bill Lee announced Sunday that the Tennessee Highway Patrol and National Guard would be mobilized because of demonstrations in Murfreesboro — where a 7 p.m. curfew was put in place. Lee, a Republican, had previously authorized more than 300 National Guard troops to help assist with the Nashville protest, which turned violent after protesters peacefully met earlier that Saturday. “The protests in Murfreesboro are no longer peaceful demonstrations but have escalated to overt threats to public safety and property,” Lee said in a statement. A separate demonstration was also held in Chattanooga, where police tackled a small handful of people and arrested one of them when protesters removed a light fixture at the Hamilton County Courthouse, according to the Times Free Press. The newspaper reports that sheriff’s deputies came out of the building with non-lethal weapons as the crowd yelled “Don’t do it” to those attempting to throw a banner at the top of the stairs of the courthouse. Meanwhile, Nashville’s honky tonks and other businesses spent Sunday largely boarding up their smashed store fronts, as cleanup crews began scrubbing graffiti and removing debris. According to Metro Nashville Police, at least 30 businesses and buildings were damaged after a peaceful “I Will Breathe” demonstration turned violent on Saturday. Fires were lit inside and outside the city’s historic courthouse, and a statue of a former state lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views was toppled. Only until a 10 p.m. curfew was ordered did the protesters finally begin to disperse. By Sunday, the same area was quiet with business owners covering up smashed windows as spectators somberly took photos of the destruction. Yet the emotions of the night were still being felt as one black man stood quietly holding one arm up watching the courthouse be cleaned. Mayor John Cooper described Saturday as a “heartbreaking night” for Nashville, noting that the area had recently already been ravaged by a fatal tornado nearly three months before that shortly followed the COVID-19 pandemic. Cooper ordered a new curfew of 8 p.m. Sunday night. He and other community leaders, lamented that most of the destruction centered around Metro Nashville Courthouse and City Hall, where multiple fires went off in and around the building after protesters smashed in windows and spray-painted obscenities along the walls and nearby structures. “Our metro courthouse, iconic for its role in the civil rights movement, was the site of much of tonight’s reprehensible vandalism,” Cooper said. “Sixty years ago, 3,000 nonviolent protesters marched to that same courthouse in a milestone moment for integration and yet tonight that same courthouse was defaced and set on fire.” In 1960, area college student leaders in the sit-in movement challenged the injustice of desegregated lunch counters in a confrontation on the courthouse steps. After the mayor agreed that it was wrong, Nashville became the first southern city in the U.S. to desegregate its lunch counters. Metro Nashville Police tweeted that 28 people were arrested during the protest and four others were arrested after a 10 p.m. curfew was implemented Saturday evening. Demonstrators earlier in the evening pulled down a statue outside the state Capitol of Edward Carmack. Carmack was a politician in the early 1900s who wrote editorials lambasting the writings of prominent Tennessee civil rights journalist Ida B. Wells. He was fatally shot in 1908 by a political rival.",0.0

Brown — “I can’t breathe…” The senseless killing of unarmed Black men, Black women, Black boys, and Black girls has become so routine that the entire nation now knows the meaning of those three words – and no matter what the color of your skin is, the significance of that fact should take your breath away. Two editors from Black Press of America newspapers on the frontlines of the uprising in Minneapolis in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd by four police officers, joined a National Newspaper Publishers Association (NNPA) livestream broadcast on Saturday, May 30, to discuss up-to-the-minute breaking news from the Twin Cities. Al McFarlane, the editor of Insight News and Mel Reeves, editor of the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, spoke of the outrage over the death of Floyd and the future of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The Spokesman-Recorder and Insight News represent 130 years of combined reporting on Black news and history in Minneapolis. Both McFarlane and Reeves remain on the ground and in the fight. They provided insight into the minds of the many who continue to express outrage over Floyd’s murder. NNPA President and CEO Dr. Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr., also joined the broadcast. “We are amidst a coronavirus pandemic, but we also have an epidemic of white supremacy, we have an epidemic of racially motivated police brutality, and right now all the eyes of the world are on Minneapolis,” Chavis noted. Reeves said there’s a cautious calm at the moment, but further protests were planned in Minneapolis. “The National Guard has been called out, and you see those vehicles that you saw when they raided Iraq and Afghanistan. People are upset and outraged, and folks are still protesting, and some folks take advantage of the protest,” Reeves stated. McFarlane focused on the appropriateness of the outrage. “The murder of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department on the evening of Memorial Day — this man was apprehended by police accused of forgery,” he voiced. “An alleged $25 infraction and the consequence was his death. Now the burning of this city and the cities across the nation,” McFarlane observed. Reeves has been in the middle of protests and has reported from the forefront. “The system that has allowed the killing of George Floyd will continue unless we come forward with an organized effort to push back, reform and change the system that’s brutalizing us,” Reeves pronounced. He added that many believe undercover police officers and non-African Americans have instigated and ignited riots and fires, which have been blamed on Black people during the uprising. “People need to be cautious in their criticism, and the truth is it wasn’t they, the young people identified undercover police officers and people who were not Black initiated the burning and breaking of windows,” Reeves continued. “The nation needs to know the power structure here needed to know that it is important to take the focus off the protest and put it back on us. They make it look like we are the violent ones, the animals, when they’ve have treated us violently and like animals,” Reeves declared. (Follow NNPA Newswire Senior Correspondent Stacy M.

Nashville Mayor John Cooper declared a state of civil emergency after protesters set a fire inside Metro Courthouse. The flames were quickly put out. Demonstrators also made their way down Broadway Street, famed for its plentiful honky tonks, as well as the historic Ryman Auditorium — known as the mother church of country music. A few small fires were lit near the the national historic landmark, which was built as a tabernacle in 1892 and restored in 1994, but those were quickly extinguished by firefighters. Thousands had rallied near the state Capitol starting in the afternoon to protest police brutality and racism. The demonstration turned violent after darkness fell, with protesters breaking windows in government buildings and causing other property damage. READ MORE A message from the Memphis Urban League President by Tonja Sesley-Baymon — Across the Urban League Movement, we are appalled by the injustices that continually deteriorates the moral fiber of our country and specifically, OUR communities of Color. Time and time again, far too often, we witness the inappropriate actions and racism of authority figures, law enforcement, and self-appointed vigilantes that Blacks have endured for generations. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to these harsh realities and inappropriate actions. There must be accountability in this continuing narrative of racially motivated violence that plague our communities. America stands at a crossroad. The choice is clear – do we have the will and the determination to finally rise above four hundred years of bigotry and racism? Unhealed wounds bandaged and glazed over by the acceptance of inaction and narrow-mindedness that choke the promise of freedom and true equality; the essential essence that launched and guided us throughout our history. I cannot and do not condone intentional damage and destruction to property and senseless lawlessness. I do however affirm that the literal and figurative incidents of past injustice will provoke outrage. It does not matter if injustices come packaged as overt acts or unspoken assumptions. It makes no difference if a false sense of superiority is fostered by ignorance or fed by hate. What we are seeing are people who are tired of feeling powerless. If you want peace, you must use your power to access and guarantee justice – not just for you but for all of us. We heard your critique of Colin Kaepernick as he peacefully kneeled, but we don’t hear you loud enough when an officer kneels on the neck of George Floyd, murdering him in broad daylight in the middle of a busy neighborhood. What would have been the story if there were no cameras? When we are accused, justice is swift. However, when we are the victims, justice is nowhere to be found. In addition to no longer tolerating intolerance, we also must protect and empower boys and Men of Color and our entire community. The color of our skin cannot make us an easy target. As a nation, we must do better … and as recent events remind us, we have to do so! Racism and inequality towards anyone are intolerable …Save Our Sons! Rep.

A volunteer from the neighborhood walks out onto Lake Street. ""Is this your business?"" she asks. Safia and her daughter Saida Hassan nod silently. ""I'm sorry,"" the woman says. It's the first time they've seen it since fiery protests erupted in cries for racial justice and state troopers in riot gear blocked the road to this street. The walls are charred black, the kitchen reduced to rubble. Glass and water are swimming in puddles as community members around them work to sweep away the destruction. Safia looks around stunned. Hers is one of hundreds of businesses damaged or destroyed in protests Thursday and Friday night. ""Alhamdulillah,"" she repeats quietly. Praise God. ""Everyone is safe."" ""My heart is broken. My mind is broken,"" she says. ""I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice."" George Floyd is the African American man who died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee last Monday for several minutes. Protests started in Minneapolis early last week and quickly spread across the country. Floyd's pleading words to the officer, ""I can't breathe,"" are now a rallying cry for people protesting the many black people who have died in police custody. Safia, a Somali immigrant, opened the restaurant in December 2018 with her retirement savings. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic she closed the restaurant and had to choose between paying for insurance and paying staff. So Safia chose her staff. That means there were no funds to rebuild. A GoFundMe page was set up to help the family. This weekend she had planned to reopen as the city started easing stay-at-home orders. She spent over $4,000 on groceries and cleanup. Now that plan is gone. ""It's not just me,"" she says. ""It's all of Lake Street, all of Minneapolis."" Her daughter Saida nods. ""This is a city in pain,"" Saida says. Across the street a row of restaurants — all locally owned, black and immigrant-owned — are all gone. But the library is OK. In the rubble, Saida finds the sign she made for her mother when the restaurant first opened. Against the black ash the wood plaque is pristine. It reads ""Mama Safia's Kitchen. Seasoned with Love."" ""Because she always cooks with love,"" Saida says. She pulls a few more knickknacks that haven't burned. ""Most of the artifacts here, I got them from Africa,"" she says. ""This one is from Somalia."" She puts them into a tiny pile of what is salvageable. Outside is a tower of all that is lost. Her sister Bibi Abdullah walks in to help. She finds prayer rugs in the banquet room her mom would rent out for small wedding dinners and religious holidays. ""We can still use these,"" she says. ""We just have to wash them."" She searches for more things she can save. ""The truth is things like this happen when people feel powerless. Something has to change,"" Bibi says. Her voice catches. Her body seems to vibrate with a mix of anger and sadness. She says she hopes that these demonstrations translate to voters at the polls come November. ""It came to this because we have people that do not care in positions of power and it should not be that way,"" Bibi says. She and her sister start to clear the big debris together. Then Saida leads her mother, Safia, to the kitchen in the back so they can assess the damage. It's a tunnel of charred walls, ash and debris. Safia gets upset and pulls away, speaking to her daughter in Somali. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" Saida responds in English as her mother walks out. ""She's just saying, 'Why are you bringing me in here? I don't want to see this,' "" Saida says. Saida gets quiet. She stands in the kitchen alone for a moment, staring at the charred walls. Then she joins her family outside where dozens of Minneapolis residents from across the city are working in groups to clear the rubble. With everything unfolding, the pandemic has slipped many people's minds. ""I forgot. Have you seen me shake hands with people?"" Saida shakes her head. ""2020, we hear you, we see you. We went from one crisis to the next. What's next?"" Saida spends every night protesting, but also trying to protect other locally owned stores and restaurants. At night she cries herself to sleep. She understands the anger and desperation that are leading some to destroy buildings. ""I'm like emotionally torn,"" Saida says. She doesn't want destruction. ""But at the same time, people are crying for help. People are saying, 'Fix this.' "" She says she hopes, from all of this pain, finally there will be change. ",0.0

Many businesses in Murfreesboro’s historic town square boarded up their windows in preparation for the crowds, fearing there could be violence. A brick was thrown through the window of Whiskey Dix on the square. After the demonstration, crowds began making their way to nearby Middle Tennessee State University’s campus, where tear gas was deployed by Murfreesboro police.

The demonstrations are in response to police killing George Floyd in Minneapolis and other black men and women who have died at the hands of law enforcement. Some have resulted in property destruction and clashes with police. The state is just one of several experiencing protests in the U.S. Here is what you need to know about about what is happening in Tennessee: National Guard lay down shields at vigil for black lives During a vigil for black lives outside the Tennessee State Capitol on Monday evening, Justin Jones asked National Guard members who were guarding the building to lay down their riot shields. They did. Jones and other demonstrators had gathered for a vigil to coincide with the first day the 111th Tennessee General Assembly is back in session. Organizers were demanding that lawmakers ""prioritize policies that protect our communities,"" according to a tweet about the vigil. Several Democratic state lawmakers walked out of the statehouse Monday night to stand with the protesters. Republican lawmakers and a few Democrats watched the scene from the statehouse's balcony. State troopers and members of the National Guard also stood outside the state house. They formed a wall with their bodies and blocked the crowd of more than 100 people from walking up to the capitol. The protesters chanted together, asking the National Guard and state troopers, ""Why are you in riot gear?"" After the members dropped their shields, the crowd began to sing. Before moving to the steps of the capitol, the vigil began across the street at Legislative Plaza where speakers addressed the crowd. ""I’m not a fan of violence and looting, but I’m not going to condemn it either,"" Albert Bender, a Cherokee activist, said to the crowd. His comment was met with applause. Bender also called out the news media for reporting on it. Lacrisha Johnson brought her daughter Kingsley to the Monday night event. ""I have to plant the foundation for her young,"" Johnson said. ""She can see solidarity. She can see things being peaceful."" Memphis also under 10 p.m. curfew Monday Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland declared Monday that a citywide curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. It will remain in effect until 6 a.m. Tuesday. Strickland said the curfew could persist as long as necessary, indicating it will likely be renewed. It does not apply to those deemed ""essential workers"" as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the property damage seen Sunday night and early Monday prompted the decision to issue the curfew. Strickland announced the curfew at an afternoon news conference that followed the fifth night of protests in Memphis against nationwide police brutality. During the news conference and in announcing the curfew, Strickland praised how peaceful Memphis protests had been and the passion he had seen. Nashville has 10 p.m. curfew Monday Mayor John Cooper said during a briefing Monday morning that a curfew will be in place in Nashville from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Tuesday morning. He said he will review a curfew on a daily basis, along with his executive order declaring a state of emergency. He once again denounced the vandalism and fires that happened Saturday night.

Tennessee National Guard deployment Chris Messina, a spokesman for the Tennessee National Guard, said roughly 450 service members were deployed throughout the state on Sunday. As was the case when 75 guardsmen were deployed in Nashville on Saturday, the service members provided assistance to local and state law enforcement officials and first responders. Messina would not provide a location breakdown, citing the “ongoing situation” and the need to “maintain operational security.” It is unclear how long the National Guard’s deployment will last, with no end date currently date set, Messina said.

The investigation into the courthouse fire and other vandalism is ongoing. Protests spread to Murfreesboro In Murfreesboro, police and protesters met face-to-face both downtown and on the campus of Middle Tennessee State University. At MTSU, a group of about 50 protesters marched toward Forrest Hall — a building named for Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest — before being intercepted by police in armored vehicles who threw tear gas canisters. Police said the canisters were used to disperse protesters who were blocking traffic by laying in the street. Police and protesters eventually negotiated a peace and were seen posing for photos and calming walking off campus together. Royce Massengill shakes hands with Sgt.

More National Guard members deployed Faced with the possibility of additional violence, Gov. Bill Lee said Sunday he is increasing a deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to help with law enforcement, this time in all three divisions of the state. The governor made the announcement one day after 75 guardsmen were deployed in Nashville in response to an eruption of violence. The rancor occurred after a peaceful rally attended by thousands of Tennesseans who were protesting police brutality and racism. More: Gov.

The demonstration, one of dozens that have occurred across the country in the last week, denounced the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and other black men and women in the U.S. Floyd, 46, died after a white Minneapolis police officer kept a knee pressed on his neck for more than eight minutes. The Rev. James Turner II, pastor of New Hope Missionary Baptist Church, spoke to the crowd on Saturday about the systemic issues hurting the African-American community. ""Black people — we're Americans. We are equal just as anyone else who claims this country,"" Turner said in a Sunday interview with The Tennessean. ""These killings are a challenge to that fact, and yesterday's rally created a moment for our city to stand together in a common pain and humanity and patriotism."" He also spoke to his congregation about it on Sunday, but Turner said he preaches every week on these issues. In Faison's Sunday sermon, he pointed to the biblical story of the prophet Nathan to demonstrate the power of speaking up. Nathan confronts King David for his oppressive acts and the king repents. ""Where are the Nathans of 2020?"" Faison said. ""We are the ones who have to show up and make change possible. And if change is going to happen, we've got to lift our voices to get it done."" Faison closed out the service with a discussion about the purpose of protests. He was joined by local activist Justin Jones and Metro Councilperson Delishia Porterfield. They both attended Saturday's rally. ""It's designed to create tension,"" Jones said. ""A protest with permission is a parade. A protest is not meant to be comfortable."" Jesus flipped tables in the temple, said Porterfield, pointing to a biblical account of Christ's anger. ""Righteous anger has its place, and we can't get so comfortable as Christians and believers that we don't display the righteous anger,"" Porterfield said. Saturday's rally was peaceful. But tensions later flared between people and police. Property was damaged, fires were set, tear gas was used and arrests were made. During Sunday's discussion, Jones criticized the police as instigators, pointing to the tactics they used to control the crowd. Rally organizers and participants say only a small group of agitators are responsible for the destruction. Police are looking for 20 to 30 people they say hijacked the demonstration, and Nashville Mayor John Cooper said officers engaged in quality policing on Saturday night. The Rev. Enoch Fuzz, who leads Corinthian Missionary Baptist Church, denounced the violence and called for people from across the city to work together for a solution. Fuzz, who was diagnosed with cancer, was not able to attend Saturday's rally because of his illness, but comments were shared on his behalf during the event. ""This violence does not seek to answer, solve, resolve nor settle any offense. It is the rage of evil and racial ignorance. Violence will not defeat itself and evil will never overcome evil,"" Fuzz said in a Sunday statement. ""Our communities must cooperate with justice."" Turner said he does not want the damage caused Saturday to detract from the important issues raised at the peaceful rally. He also hopes people will continue to work toward solutions. ""We have to take action, to stand in unity, to participate in the election, to vote in the right people,"" said Turner, who is running for a seat in the state legislature.

(WJHL)- Around a hundred people gathered at Centennial Park Sunday for the city’s first official protest in Kingsport after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. A large crowd repeated his name during the event as they shared stories of racial inequality. “We’re all frustrated, we’re all disgusted about what’s been going on not only in our country between law enforcement and historically black people,” said the pastor of Great Life Church of Kingsport, Barry Braan. Protest organizers made sure law enforcement was aware of the event. “We reached out to the police department and wanted to make sure we were okay to be down here, there was going to be no issues so forth and so on. I wanted to make sure that everybody had an idea of what it is we wanted to do,” said Braan. The event started off with a prayer, then several speakers voiced their opinions and shared a message of equality. “At the end of the day, love is the answer. We’re not here to point the finger. We’re not here to cause any more discourse or division in the community. We’re just here to come together,” said Keira Moore, Redemptive Life Foundation Founder. Kingsport residents said they just want their voices to be heard. “When it comes to the police department and people of color, we need to sit down and have a conversation. It’s important for us to do that so we can learn about each other,” said Johanna Milton. She and her husband Darin Milton came to the event to show solidarity. “I support my husband and all black people throughout the world. I’m all races. We all need to come together, and I’m just grateful to be able to have this opportunity,” said Johanna. “Worldwide, I think it’s time for a change. You know it’s been going on for a long time and enough is enough,” said Darin. Even though there were a few people who tried to distract from the event, the overall message was clear. “I really don’t believe that we have the same type of issues that we have in other places around the country, but if we’re not careful I don’t know how far away we are from it at the same time. So we’re just making sure we stay on the right side of this thing,” said Barry Braan.",0.0

(WKRN) — Demonstrators marched in Murfreesboro Sunday afternoon in a largely peaceful display for George Floyd, a man who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis last week, before tear gas was deployed onto participants. Many businesses in Murfreesboro’s historic town square boarded up their windows in preparation for the crowds, fearing there could be violence. A brick was thrown through the window of Whiskey Dix on the square. After the demonstration, crowds made their way to nearby Middle Tennessee State University’s campus, where tear gas was deployed by Murfreesboro police. The gas was deployed at the intersection of East Main Street and Middle Tennessee Boulevard at a crowd of protesters who were blocking the intersection and were almost hit by traffic, according to Murfreesboro police. An armored vehicle was also vandalized. Murfreesboro police reported one person was overcome by the gas and treated on the scene but did not require hospitalization. Another was treated after a fainting episode on the square. (Photo: WKRN) Two people were arrested for violating the Governor’s emergency curfew order. The peaceful demonstration at the square included nine minutes of silence, to symbolize the nine minutes a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into George Floyd’s neck. “It’s about everybody joining together, it’s about people that aren’t of the black race speaking up for us as well,” explained demonstrator Gloria Harris. “By staying silent, you’re allowing this to happen. That’s why we’re out here today. To show support for other people who are of color, who are not white,” added Haleigh Zegel. The city-wide curfew for Murfreesboro expired at 5 a.m. Monday.",0.0

It was a dirty, disgraceful lie, promulgated by those who see the athletes they watch as two-dimensional instruments of their own entertainment, not as people whose platform should be used to tell the truth about the experience of being black in this country. It is an avatar for why America is burning. It can’t be allowed to happen again. Eventually, the protests, which were started after the death of George Floyd, will calm down. Floyd, an unarmed black man, was killed in police custody May 25 in Minneapolis. Sports will come back, even as a pandemic has killed more than 100,000 of our fellow citizens. The games will look different for awhile. We won’t have those filled stadiums and the images that allow people with no desire to lift the rug on this country’s history to drone on about how sports bring us together. But that’s not really true. Not when the people who play them, and sometimes cover them as journalists and commentators, are shouted down for trying to make the rest of us understand that even wealth and fame don’t inoculate anyone from racism. OPINION:College football coaches scared to speak, stand with players in conversations on racism, police brutality CORONAVIRUS & SPORTS: Get the latest news and information right in your inbox. Sign up here. Stick to sports sounds silly today, doesn’t it? It has to when you think about Jaylen Brown driving 15 hours from Boston to Atlanta and Malcolm Brogdon leading a peaceful protest in their hometown at a time when the NBA is trying to figure out how to come back in July. It has to when you see the UConn women’s basketball team declare definitely, courageously that, “Yes, we are rioting. And yes, we are protesting because we are tired of innocent black lives dying at the hands of police officers who do not care about our humanity.” There were many, many more statements this weekend from pro athletes, from college athletes, from coaches and from team owners that expressed anger, sadness and uncertainty about how this ends. You can question the sincerity of them if you wish. In some cases, particularly among many NFL owners, there are reasons to doubt whether the sudden willingness to address racism and police brutality are anything more than a short-term public relations ploy. ​ But this time, it feels as if we’re not going back. Athletes are not going to stick to sports anymore. Not just black and brown athletes, but more and more white athletes, too. They’re going to call racism by its name, and they’re not going to aid and abet the comfort of those who don't want the reality of being black in America shoved in their face. Stick to sports, after all, is a cancer. It’s insidious. It grants emotional refuge to those who deny the inequality in our midst because it allows them to feel as though rooting for a black person in a sporting event does not make them a racist. Of course, we know that is not true. Athletes hear those epithets from the stands. They see them on social media. And yet, they’re expected to turn the other cheek and not complain or speak out. God forbid they get involved in politics or support a candidate for president. That would be really offensive, wouldn’t it? This is the game that people like Fox News host Laura Ingraham play when they tell LeBron James to “Shut up and dribble.” The black athletes? They can take anything, no matter how often they get racially profiled or how many of the innocent people from their community get killed by police. In that universe of bad faith, it’s the offended white fans who really need the protection from their feelings. It’s time to stop protecting them. It’s time to stop worrying about what they think. It’s time to instead welcome them to the real world. Stick to sports is for the feeble. Its underlying theory is that people watch games because they want a good time without the complication of having to think about the people they’re watching, who they really are and where they come from. And the people who promote it will tell you that even a small amount of discomfort to watch someone do amazing, awe-inspiring things with a football or basketball is too high a price. Well, the price just went up. It went up because the reality about systemic racism in America has been suppressed too many times and sports too often used as an excuse to suppress it. It went up because athletes have grown tired of the charade that kumbaya corporatism has wanted them to obey. It went up because suppression of their voice has finally boiled over. It went up because honesty is the only way to accomplish what all these sanguine statements from teams and athletic departments say they want for our future as a country. Stick to sports is not honest. And it needs to go away forever.",0.0

The demonstrations are in response to police killing George Floyd in Minneapolis and other black men and women who have died at the hands of law enforcement. Some have resulted in property destruction and clashes with police. The state is just one of several experiencing protests in the U.S. Here is what you need to know about about what is happening in Tennessee: National Guard lay down shields at vigil for black lives During a vigil for black lives outside the Tennessee State Capitol on Monday evening, Justin Jones asked National Guard members who were guarding the building to lay down their riot shields. They did. Jones and other demonstrators had gathered for a vigil to coincide with the first day the 111th Tennessee General Assembly is back in session. Organizers were demanding that lawmakers ""prioritize policies that protect our communities,"" according to a tweet about the vigil. Several Democratic state lawmakers walked out of the statehouse Monday night to stand with the protesters. Republican lawmakers and a few Democrats watched the scene from the statehouse's balcony. State troopers and members of the National Guard also stood outside the state house. They formed a wall with their bodies and blocked the crowd of more than 100 people from walking up to the capitol. The protesters chanted together, asking the National Guard and state troopers, ""Why are you in riot gear?"" After the members dropped their shields, the crowd began to sing. Before moving to the steps of the capitol, the vigil began across the street at Legislative Plaza where speakers addressed the crowd. ""I’m not a fan of violence and looting, but I’m not going to condemn it either,"" Albert Bender, a Cherokee activist, said to the crowd. His comment was met with applause. Bender also called out the news media for reporting on it. Lacrisha Johnson brought her daughter Kingsley to the Monday night event. ""I have to plant the foundation for her young,"" Johnson said. ""She can see solidarity. She can see things being peaceful."" Memphis also under 10 p.m. curfew Monday Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland declared Monday that a citywide curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. It will remain in effect until 6 a.m. Tuesday. Strickland said the curfew could persist as long as necessary, indicating it will likely be renewed. It does not apply to those deemed ""essential workers"" as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the property damage seen Sunday night and early Monday prompted the decision to issue the curfew. Strickland announced the curfew at an afternoon news conference that followed the fifth night of protests in Memphis against nationwide police brutality. During the news conference and in announcing the curfew, Strickland praised how peaceful Memphis protests had been and the passion he had seen. Nashville has 10 p.m. curfew Monday Mayor John Cooper said during a briefing Monday morning that a curfew will be in place in Nashville from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Tuesday morning. He said he will review a curfew on a daily basis, along with his executive order declaring a state of emergency. He once again denounced the vandalism and fires that happened Saturday night.

Tennessee National Guard deployment Chris Messina, a spokesman for the Tennessee National Guard, said roughly 450 service members were deployed throughout the state on Sunday. As was the case when 75 guardsmen were deployed in Nashville on Saturday, the service members provided assistance to local and state law enforcement officials and first responders. Messina would not provide a location breakdown, citing the “ongoing situation” and the need to “maintain operational security.” It is unclear how long the National Guard’s deployment will last, with no end date currently date set, Messina said. Police make arson arrest in courthouse fire Nashville police arrested a 25-year-old man on felony arson and vandalism charges in connection with the fire set Saturday night in the Metro Nashville courthouse. Detectives from the specialized investigations division and SWAT officers took Wesley Somers into custody on Sunday night, according to a Twitter post from the Metro Nashville Police Department. The arrest was made at a home on Manzano Road in the city's Madison neighborhood, police said.

The investigation into the courthouse fire and other vandalism is ongoing. Protests spread to Murfreesboro In Murfreesboro, police and protesters met face-to-face both downtown and on the campus of Middle Tennessee State University. At MTSU, a group of about 50 protesters marched toward Forrest Hall — a building named for Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest — before being intercepted by police in armored vehicles who threw tear gas canisters. Police said the canisters were used to disperse protesters who were blocking traffic by laying in the street. Police and protesters eventually negotiated a peace and were seen posing for photos and calming walking off campus together. Royce Massengill shakes hands with Sgt.

Bill Lee said Sunday he is increasing a deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to help with law enforcement, this time in all three divisions of the state. The governor made the announcement one day after 75 guardsmen were deployed in Nashville in response to an eruption of violence. The rancor occurred after a peaceful rally attended by thousands of Tennesseans who were protesting police brutality and racism. More: Gov.

Members of The Stage's staff fortified themselves in the business' back office Saturday night as people broke through the Broadway bar's windows. They had closed early as a peaceful protest against police brutality and the killing of George Floyd was followed by destruction in downtown Nashville. The staff, unable to leave in time, waited for it to end. When the sun rose Sunday, it revealed broken glass, a smashed cash register, stage equipment dragged into the street and potential evidence that someone tried — unsuccessfully — to start a fire. At least 30 businesses were damaged overnight. ""We've had a lot of folks helping (clean up), and that's the main thing, that everybody's OK,"" owner Brenda Sanderson told The Tennessean on Sunday morning. Multiple community members volunteered in the cleanup effort Sunday, scrubbing spray paint off walls, boarding windows and sweeping shattered glass.

1622271591,2020-06-01 08:20:30,Unrest demonstrates Biden's challenge in breaking through,http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129771,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden is facing some stiff competition in getting his campaign message out. President Donald Trump spent much of the weekend using Twitter as a bullhorn to urge ""law and order"" and tougher action by police against protesters around the country. Biden quietly visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd. That low-key, high-touch approach may be a sign of how the presumptive Democratic nominee presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by the much louder, more persistent voice of Trump. On one of the most profound weekends the nation has seen, with violence in dozens of cities, Biden was out of wide public view. ""He's not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,"" said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. ""America just needs to be reassured that there's someone who's understanding, someone who's willing to say, 'Yes, we do have some issues,' and someone who's willing to address it."" Reassurance requires presence, though, and that has been a hurdle for the former vice president, driven inside by the coronavirus pandemic, still working to adapt to the power of social media as a substitute and without the natural platform of a public office. Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America's systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden. There are some signs that Biden is looking to take on a more active role. On Sunday, his campaign released a photo of him visiting the site of protests in Wilmington. Biden, wearing a mask to protect from COVID-19, knelt down to talk to a man and a young child. ""The only way to bear this pain is to turn all that anguish to purpose,"" Biden wrote in a message attached to the photo. ""And as President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen."" On Monday, Biden plans to venture out again to meet with community leaders in Wilmington. Demings said she has also offered to have discussions with the Biden campaign on criminal justice reforms. She's pushed for a major Justice Department review of law enforcement agencies throughout the country and said she saw a role for the federal government in implementing standard policies that govern hiring, training, retention and pay and benefits for law enforcement officers. ""What I have done is offer my service to the campaign and, and anyone else, to look at what we can do working together moving forward. And so we'll see. We have a lot of work to do,"" she said. ""We're going to discuss ideas and make recommendations."" Biden released a criminal justice reform plan last July but has not issued an updated or more specific proposal since then. In early May, he released his ""Plan for Black America,"" an economic- and education-focused agenda that included marijuana decriminalization. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He's called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. Democrats believe the former vice president draws a contrast with Trump in such moments that works in his favor. They note that while Biden didn't appear on television all weekend, he spoke about Floyd's death before Trump addressed it and has shown compassion for the protesters. Trump has alternated between expressing alarm over Floyd's death and sympathy for his family and issuing tweets antagonizing protesters and disparaging his political enemies. And in an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. And some Democrats who have criticized Biden in the past for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. ""I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. ""There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now."" ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, ""Ground Game.""",0.0
1622271587,2020-06-01 08:18:45,Civil unrest could influence Biden's search for running mate,http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129769,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden's search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd's death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden's choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a ""transition"" candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd's death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. ""The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it's important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,"" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who's been asked for input by Biden's team on the selection process. Biden was pressed to pick a black woman on Monday when he visited a black church in Wilmington, Delaware. ""A black female will overwhelm and excite and turn the heads of these young people and everybody out there,"" an attendee told Biden, referring to those demonstrating in the streets. Beyond Bottoms, Biden is believed to be considering California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. In an interview Sunday with The Associated Press, Demings didn't answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman. ""Well, we've never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate,"" she said. ""But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward."" Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. Demings, a former Orlando police chief, defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring ""you're either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution."" ""The community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,"" she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. ""Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,"" he said. ""I've got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn't want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same."" Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd's murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. ""This is very tough timing for her,"" said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she's not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Biden's search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. ""It's important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don't mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,"" said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair. __ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

Volunteers continued cleanup efforts, scrubbing away graffiti and removing debris the debris of two days of protests. The demonstrations, like others nationwide, erupted after the death of George Floyd, a black man in handcuffs who pleaded for air as a white officer in Minnesota pressed a knee into his neck last week. The majority of the weekend arrests were made in Nashville, where fires were lit inside and outside the city's historic courthouse. Thousands had peacefully rallied outside the state Capitol on Saturday, but demonstrations turned violent after darkness fell. Meanwhile, 30 businesses were vandalized, including a handful of Nashville's famous honky tonks on Broadway. A statue of a former state lawmaker and newspaper publisher Edward Carmack, who espoused racist views, was toppled. That statue was taken Monday to a state museum. Police have since arrested Wesley Somers, 25, and accusing him of setting fire to the building. Law enforcement have asked the public for tips to find others also suspected of causing damage. For the third night in a row, Mayor John Cooper announced Nashville would be under a curfew starting at 10 p.m. Monday and running until 6 a.m. curfew. That comes even though no major demonstrations or clashes between police and protesters took place the day before. In Memphis, Mayor Jim Strickland also imposed a similar 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew for most people, except essential workers and those experiencing a medical issue. The National Guard, which has been in Memphis working on the new coronavirus outbreak response, will be in the city to help local authorities. Strickland said he was on a call this weekend with mayors and police chiefs from 40 cities and curfews were discussed. ""They really felt curfews were needed once there is property damage or some kind of violent act,"" Strickland said. ""We saw that last night."" Memphis Police Director Michael Rallings said he has seen videos of protesters being arrested that are being used by activists to allege police are using excessive force. ""An arrest is never going to be pretty,"" Rallings said. He later noted the department has a ""very elaborate use of force policy"" and the department will deal with officers who transgress that policy. Rallings reported that 10 businesses have been damaged, three officers have been shot at, and 44 protesters have been arrested since Wednesday, when protests began in Memphis. The demonstrations spreading across America were held around Tennessee over the weekend in response to the latest killings of black people by police. Separate demonstrations were held in Knoxville, Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, but no curfews have been set in place as of Monday. At least 10 arrests were made in Chattanooga on Sunday. According to a spokeswoman, Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke and Police Chief David Roddy ""have agreed that, at this moment in time, instituting a curfew would be unnecessary and practically unenforceable.""",0.0

Social media platforms have become so pervasive that courts have considered them part of the public square, where ideas are shared freely and speech should be protected. Some bad actors, however, have tried to exploit social media platforms to intentionally introduce and popularize false and misleading information in efforts to manipulate public opinion. A government report claimed foreign agents activated thousands of accounts across several social media platforms in coordinated and ongoing efforts to influence our elections. Some of the platforms themselves have discovered groups, foreign and domestic, disseminating false information in attempts to advance their agendas. Last week, our president, a prolific and skilled Twitter user, was tagged by that platform’s fact-checker as he painted mail-in ballots as rife with fraud. A few days later, another of his tweets, this one about the escalating social unrest in Minneapolis, where a video showed a white police officer kneeling on the neck of a black man suspected of forging checks until he suffocated, was tagged by the company as violating its rules against glorifying violence. In response, President Trump issued an executive order attempting to lessen social media companies’ protections from lawsuits, claiming some have not been acting in “good faith” as the host of public discussions. The order will likely face legal challenges, but it has sparked discussions about the role and powers of social media companies in our everyday interactions. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he disagreed with Twitter’s fact-checking policy, stating he didn’t believe Facebook “should be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online."" It’s a First Amendment issue with serious implications for our lives and our democratic republic, so we though we ask you.

Knoxville News Sentinel Black Lives Matter Knoxville leaders condemned the vandalism Saturday night on Market Square that followed a peaceful protest through downtown the day before by hundreds of demonstrators. A crowd estimated by the Knoxville Police Department to include 50-100 people swarmed the downtown area late Saturday night, smashing several windows at Market Square businesses and destroying planters in what police deemed a ""riot."" Officers fired nonlethal pepper balls at suspected vandals and arrested two men before the crowd was dispersed by 2 a.m. Sunday. Another round of vandalism followed on Sunday night in Fort Sanders, where at least 15 vehicles were damaged. Police arrested nine adults and one juvenile on disorderly conduct charges. Each of the adults, ages 18-34, has a Knoxville address, according to KPD.

""We have the attention of the leadership here,"" Every said in a video posted to the Black Lives Matter Knoxville Facebook page Sunday. ""And that is not because we came down here and tore stuff up. ""You rioted with no demands — what was the point? It was the most counter-productive protest ever. White children, this is not your movement! And I found out that it was white kids that organized that movement (Saturday night). I appreciate your passion, but this is not your movement!"" Knoxville resident Dakota Will Gifford, 20, was arrested shortly after midnight Sunday as the crowd on Market Square dispersed and officers followed him to the nearby parking garage. Dakota Will Gifford (Photo: Knox County Detention Facility) Gifford was armed with a loaded handgun in his waistband, according to arrest warrants. Officers recovered nine other firearms during a search of his vehicle, including two shotguns, a rifle and six more handguns, along with multiple rounds of various ammunition. The search also turned up crystal methamphetamine, LSD and marijuana, the warrants state. Gifford told officers he had heard a riot was planned at the Target near West Town Mall, but he had no intention of going and instead came to Market Square to skateboard, according to the warrants. Police said Gifford, who was dressed in all black with a black face mask, had no skateboard. ""He continued to say that he was not on Market Square to meet anyone,"" the warrants read. Gifford remained jailed on a $90,000 bond Monday morning on charges of possession of weapon during commission of a dangerous felony, possession with intent to sell a Schedule I drug, and possession with intent to sell a Schedule II drug. A second man, 18-year-old Dominic D. Brown, of Heiskell, also was arrested after he threw a trashcan lid into a police SUV, striking a KPD officer in the head, according to arrest warrants. Dominic D. Brown (Photo: Knox County Detention Facility) The officer was uninjured, although a second officer suffered a minor injury during Brown's arrest, according to KPD. Officers responding to the vandalism on Market Square spotted Brown, ""tell a group of approximately 80 people to stay together when the riot begins,"" the warrants state. Brown is charged with misdemeanor assault, disorderly conduct, evading arrest, resisting arrest and inciting to riot. He was released on bond Sunday afternoon. Organizer and former Knoxville City Council candidate David Hayes, who also spoke at Friday's Black Lives Matter protest, criticized the police response to the vandalism Saturday night. In a Facebook post, Hayes said he arrived well after the crowd gathered Saturday night on Market Square. He said he, too, was shot with pepper balls by KPD while trying to escort those who had ""just left an escalation with the police. ""I met up with the young folks still marching and at one moment was towards the back,"" Hayes said. ""All of sudden cops targeted and violently attacked and arrested one young person in the crowd and started shooting everyone around (including me) with pepper balls. ""I’m sure the story will be these young folks caused a lot of property damage all over downtown and attacked the cops, but I can tell you it was the cops who escalated and caused harm in situations I witnessed, not the young folks."" KPD spokesman Scott Erland responded to the criticism, saying the officers' tactics were ""solely in response to increasing violence and extended vandalism. ""The pepper balls were not used to impede on lawful assembly, but in a limited capacity to prevent further unlawful activity and uphold public safety,"" Erland told Knox News. ""Additionally, pepper balls were deployed only after two orders to disperse had been given.""

1622313068,2020-06-01 07:38:50,Federal officials investigating if extremist groups infiltrated protests,https://www.wkrn.com/news/federal-officials-investigating-if-extremist-groups-infiltrated-protests/,en,True,,84748,wkrn.com,http://www.wkrn.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a “very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.” President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There’s a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it’s not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia.” Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even as he cried he couldn’t breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials.",0.0

Fischer also said that Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad, who had already announced his resignation in May, has been fired; officials extended a nightly 9 p.m. curfew in the city to June 8. The announcements came hours after Gov. Andy Beshear has Kentucky State Police to investigate the early Monday incident that featured Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shooting the owner of a popular West End barbecue business at 26th Street and Broadway. The victim was David McAtee, the popular owner of a barbecue business next to the Dino's Food Mart parking lot where the shooting occurred around 12:15 a.m. Monday, McAtee's nephew told The Courier Journal. Louisville police and National Guard troops were breaking up a ""large crowd"" that had gathered in the parking lot outside Dino's Food Mart in the Russell neighborhood when someone shot at them, Conrad said Monday morning.

""Both LMPD and National Guard members returned fire."" Conrad said it is unclear if the person who was shot was the person who also fired at the officers. LOUISVILLE: From tense to touching moments, here's how Louisville's protests went down Sunday night At a Monday morning news conference in Frankfort, Beshear said he had contacted Fischer and asked LMPD to release the ""significant"" amount of body camera footage from the incident ""as soon as possible."" The governor added that he wants any video footage to be released Monday ""before nightfall."" ""I think it's really important for the truth to get out there,"" Beshear said. ""But I think it's also really important in ensuring that we don't have violence if people can see (and) know that, bad or ugly, we're being absolutely transparent about it."" ""I don't want people to have to wait several days,"" Beshear added. ""I think it's very important to communicate with the public, especially with the tensions right now."" Conrad said that police had ""several persons of interest"" who were being interviewed following the shooting. ""We are collecting video from the incident and expect to release what we have sometime (Monday),"" Conrad added. The shooting came after a curfew had once again taken effect at 9 p.m. Sunday as protests and unrest over the death of Breonna Taylor continued for the fourth straight night. Greg Fischer first implemented the 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. curfew Saturday and said it would be reevaluated Monday morning. About 350 Kentucky National Guard personnel were also first called in Saturday night to help with ""maintaining peace and protect critical infrastructure,"" as Fischer had said.

Knoxville News Sentinel Black Lives Matter Knoxville leaders condemned the vandalism Saturday night on Market Square that followed a peaceful protest through downtown the day before by hundreds of demonstrators. A crowd estimated by the Knoxville Police Department to include 50-100 people swarmed the downtown area late Saturday night, smashing several windows at Market Square businesses and destroying planters in what police deemed a ""riot."" Officers fired nonlethal pepper balls at suspected vandals and arrested two men before the crowd was dispersed by 2 a.m. Sunday. Another round of vandalism followed on Sunday night in Fort Sanders, where at least 15 vehicles were damaged. Police arrested nine adults and one juvenile on disorderly conduct charges. Each of the adults, ages 18-34, has a Knoxville address, according to KPD. Here is some initial surveillance video that we have obtained from last night’s events in downtown Knoxville, captured from Ruby Sunshine on Market Street pic.twitter.com/ww3FiOKDfO — Knoxville Police TN (@Knoxville_PD) May 31, 2020 Activist Constance Every said Saturday night's destruction was completely counter-productive to the large demonstration against police brutality organized by Black Lives Matter Knoxville on Friday, which drew support from Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon and other local elected officials. ""We have the attention of the leadership here,"" Every said in a video posted to the Black Lives Matter Knoxville Facebook page Sunday. ""And that is not because we came down here and tore stuff up. ""You rioted with no demands — what was the point? It was the most counter-productive protest ever. White children, this is not your movement! And I found out that it was white kids that organized that movement (Saturday night). I appreciate your passion, but this is not your movement!"" Knoxville resident Dakota Will Gifford, 20, was arrested shortly after midnight Sunday as the crowd on Market Square dispersed and officers followed him to the nearby parking garage. Dakota Will Gifford (Photo: Knox County Detention Facility) Gifford was armed with a loaded handgun in his waistband, according to arrest warrants. Officers recovered nine other firearms during a search of his vehicle, including two shotguns, a rifle and six more handguns, along with multiple rounds of various ammunition. The search also turned up crystal methamphetamine, LSD and marijuana, the warrants state. Gifford told officers he had heard a riot was planned at the Target near West Town Mall, but he had no intention of going and instead came to Market Square to skateboard, according to the warrants. Police said Gifford, who was dressed in all black with a black face mask, had no skateboard. ""He continued to say that he was not on Market Square to meet anyone,"" the warrants read. Gifford remained jailed on a $90,000 bond Monday morning on charges of possession of weapon during commission of a dangerous felony, possession with intent to sell a Schedule I drug, and possession with intent to sell a Schedule II drug. A second man, 18-year-old Dominic D. Brown, of Heiskell, also was arrested after he threw a trashcan lid into a police SUV, striking a KPD officer in the head, according to arrest warrants. Dominic D. Brown (Photo: Knox County Detention Facility) The officer was uninjured, although a second officer suffered a minor injury during Brown's arrest, according to KPD. Officers responding to the vandalism on Market Square spotted Brown, ""tell a group of approximately 80 people to stay together when the riot begins,"" the warrants state. Brown is charged with misdemeanor assault, disorderly conduct, evading arrest, resisting arrest and inciting to riot. He was released on bond Sunday afternoon. Organizer and former Knoxville City Council candidate David Hayes, who also spoke at Friday's Black Lives Matter protest, criticized the police response to the vandalism Saturday night. In a Facebook post, Hayes said he arrived well after the crowd gathered Saturday night on Market Square. He said he, too, was shot with pepper balls by KPD while trying to escort those who had ""just left an escalation with the police. ""I met up with the young folks still marching and at one moment was towards the back,"" Hayes said. ""All of sudden cops targeted and violently attacked and arrested one young person in the crowd and started shooting everyone around (including me) with pepper balls. ""I’m sure the story will be these young folks caused a lot of property damage all over downtown and attacked the cops, but I can tell you it was the cops who escalated and caused harm in situations I witnessed, not the young folks."" KPD spokesman Scott Erland responded to the criticism, saying the officers' tactics were ""solely in response to increasing violence and extended vandalism. ""The pepper balls were not used to impede on lawful assembly, but in a limited capacity to prevent further unlawful activity and uphold public safety,"" Erland told Knox News. ""Additionally, pepper balls were deployed only after two orders to disperse had been given.""

Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Louisville, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds. More than 17,000 National Guard troops have been activated in states across the U.S. due to civil unrest as of Monday, and that number is expected to grow. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody last Monday. Video shows that a Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes shortly before his death. Tensions were already simmering following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was jogging through a Glynn County, Ga., neighborhood when he was shot dead. Three white men were arrested last month after state investigators took over the case from local authorities. Protests also continued for a fourth straight night in Louisville, Ky., as activists called for justice for Taylor. Police shot and killed the 26-year-old black woman in her home. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitrailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown that had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed, northbound on Interstate 35W. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. ""It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn't appear to drive through any barricades,"" the department tweeted. Some protesters jumped on top of the truck, and as it stopped, they dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. ""He was driving a gas tanker,"" said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. ""He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful."" State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so that the protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest had appeared peaceful. Tensions flare in the nation's capital Washington, D.C., authorities imposed a curfew after an evening of escalating demonstrations. Protesters threw bottles at police and set fires to cars and the basement of historic St. John's Church, which has been visited by every president since James Madison. ""Tonight's curfew will begin at 7 p.m. and will run for two days,"" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a late morning news conference on Monday. It's primary day in the nation's capital on Tuesday, and the curfew goes into effect an hour before polls close at 8 p.m., according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections website. The protests on Sunday began with peaceful marchers, along with a police escort, moving their way along a nearly 2-mile stretch from Howard University to Lafayette Square in front of the White House. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd and other African Americans who have died following police violence. ""Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,"" read a sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. ""It's crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,"" she said. ""We are at a point where it's the same story, the same things are happening. I'm tired of this."" But after clashes with law enforcement and the fires erupting, police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Kentucky authorities investigate shooting death in Louisville Kentucky's governor said that one person died early Monday as security forces confronted a crowd in central Louisville. ""While working to disperse a crowd, [Louisville Metro Police Department] and the Kentucky National Guard were fired upon,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. ""LMPD and the Kentucky National Guard returned fire resulting in a death."" He announced that the Kentucky State Police will be investigating the matter. Statement from Governor Andy Beshear: pic.twitter.com/MyHxcE3Ntn — Governor Andy Beshear (@GovAndyBeshear) June 1, 2020 Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted his ""deepest condolences"" for the family of the man, whom he identified as David McAtee. Fischer also called for a Day of Reflection on Monday. He held a late morning virtual gathering on Facebook with faith leaders after another night of demonstrations in the city over the death of Breonna Taylor. On Sunday, law enforcement officers earlier fired tear gas into a crowd assembled in the Jefferson Square area of the city, NPR member station WFPL reported. At a Sunday evening news conference, Fischer again thanked those protesting peacefully but said others were ""hijacking"" their efforts. Tomorrow, Monday, June 1, 2020 I am declaring a Day of Reflection in our city. We will have a virtual gathering at 11:30 a.m. Monday on Facebook with local faith leaders. We’ll be talking about the events of the last few days & acknowledging the pain we’ve all felt. 2/2 — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) June 1, 2020 Atlanta officers terminated for excessive force Two Atlanta police officers have been terminated and three others placed on desk duty after a video of the arrest of two young African Americans leaving the protests Saturday night went viral. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the officers' firing on Sunday, saying the footage ""was disturbing on many levels."" ""We understand our officers are working very long hours, under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that veteran officers Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter were terminated. The footage from Streeter's body camera shows the officers confronting the pair as the two were leaving the downtown protests after the 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. At roughly the 2:30 mark in the video, one of them is seen sitting in the driver's seat of a car, recording officers arresting someone else. An officer opens the car door and asks the driver if he wants to go to jail. Several minutes later, officers approach the car again. One uses a baton to smash the driver's side window. Police then use a stun gun on the driver, who has been identified by local media as Messiah Young. Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that Young suffered an epileptic seizure, according to Spelman College's Student Government Association. The second person, a woman who has since been identified as Taniyah Pilgrim, has been released from custody and charges against her dropped. Footage posted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows the passenger pleading with police to stop as they also use a stun gun against her. ''They haven't heard us"": Protests escalate in Southern California Vandalism and violence broke out after peaceful protests in Santa Monica and other parts of Southern California on Sunday — a sequence of events that has become familiar in many U.S. cities in the past week. The new round of destruction came despite a curfew and the presence of the National Guard. ""We tried kneeling,"" protester Jesus Guzman, 19, told NPR's Doualy Xaykaothao near the Santa Monica Pier. ""We tried putting on those T-shirts that said 'I can't breathe.' We tried those hashtags. We tried doing it all peacefully, but they haven't heard us — they haven't done nothing."" ""The violence, for him, is justified,"" Xaykaothao reported. With store windows smashed, some shop owners in Santa Monica started cleaning up the mess overnight — the latest setback after weeks of forced closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At their hair salon, Martha Padilla-Bruni and her family were sweeping up broken glass under the streetlights. ""I'm in shock. I don't know what's going to happen,"" Padilla-Bruni told NPR's Nathan Rott. Her son, Joe Franco, said he supports the protesters and those who were there earlier in the day. He said he understands that people are in pain. Franco said, ""But I was here across the street, and what I saw, the people that were doing this ... they were not here to protest. They were here to cause trouble."" Reporter in Long Beach, Calif., hit in throat by rubber bullet KPCC/LAist reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez was hit in the throat by a rubber bullet Sunday evening during protests in Long Beach, Calif. He believes the bullet was fired by Long Beach police, who had been firing the projectiles nearby. ""I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat,"" Guzman-Lopez said via Twitter, posting an image of his wound. ""I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street.""

The reporter said he had just finished interviewing a man who had been kneeling in protest when he himself was hit. ""I talked to him for about a minute, and just as I was finishing talking to him — right after I said, 'Thank you' — I heard a pop and I felt something, you know, the bottom of my throat, and I saw something bounced onto the ground, and then I ran,"" he said. ""As I was running, I did start to feel its sting, and then I put my fingers to my throat and there was blood on my fingers."" A number of journalists have been hit with police projectiles during the protests, including MSNBC's Ali Velshi, who was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet in Minneapolis, and a Louisville TV reporter who was shot with pepper balls.

Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Some health experts have warned that a resurgence in cases could take place if Americans don't adhere to strict social distancing, or take other precautions like wear masks. The White House has also said that cases could go down in the warmer summer months. Does that happen? And if so, do Americans get too comfortable and lapse into a false sense of security — only to see a spike in the fall? None of it's clear, but the U.S. is heading into a period of pandemic experimentation with no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus as yet. 3. Could Steve King lose? Steny Hoyer faces challenge: It's hard to believe, but there are elections on Tuesday. Two of the marquee races deal with well-known — and very different — political figures. Controversial Rep. Steve King, with a history of making racist remarks, is in a fight for his political life with state Sen. Randy Feenstra in Iowa's Republican primary. Conservative groups have lined up against King, but he can't be counted out. This district has a long history of voting for him, despite his pariah status within the party. In Maryland, Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, is facing a primary challenge from the left in 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes, inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's unlikely win in New York over Joe Crowley, a former congressional Democratic leader. Iowa, Maryland and several other states, plus Washington, D.C., hold primaries Tuesday. 4. Biden to get closer to officially clinching nomination: Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is on the ballot Tuesday, too. Remember, he still hasn't acquired the delegates needed to officially put him over the top for the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of doing that. With 500 at stake Tuesday, Biden needs 85% of them Tuesday to clinch. That's unlikely, so look at next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote — with their 133 delegates up for grabs — for Biden to hit the magic number of 1,991. (Follow all the math here with the NPR delegate tracker.) 5. Origins of Trump campaign investigation to be probed: In Congress, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into members of the 2016 Trump campaign. The Senate is also expected to vote on nominations, including for the Treasury Department's inspector general for the pandemic response. And action is possible on changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. Last week, the House, nearly unanimously, passed a bill that reduces the percentage of the loans that businesses have to use toward payroll and gives businesses more time to spend the money and to pay the loans back. Flashback quotation: ""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, 'Please don't be too nice.' When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head]. Like, 'Don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?'

The Tennessee National Guard stands ready, in partnership with local law enforcement, the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, and TEMA, to ensure order and safety are maintained in the supported areas for as long as is warranted by the situation. In addition to support from the Guard, Governor Lee has authorized the continuation of a curfew in Nashville and will support similar measures in other Tennessee cities as requested. Curfew in the downtown Nashville area and Urban Services District of Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County will be effective at 8:00pm CT on May 31st, 2020, and will continue until 6:00am CT on June 1st, 2020. The curfew will not apply to law enforcement and fire department personnel, first responders, and other officials assisting with maintaining public safety, including medical personnel in the performance of their duties, and any other persons lawfully on the streets and in public places with permission from law enforcement personnel.

Protesters chanted “Black lives matter” and “George Floyd,” standing side by side to block vehicles as officers held clubs and pepper spray. The group walked on the interstate before making its way back to the downtown area and the famed Beale Street, where protesters were met by officers wearing helmets and holding protective shields in front of the FedExForum, the NBA basketball arena and concert venue. The demonstration marked the fifth night in a row people had met in Memphis to protest the death of Floyd, a black man who died last week after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck as Floyd pleaded for air. The night before, Memphis police faced a standoff with a crowd after a peaceful demonstration was held at the National Civil Rights Museum. Memphis police said protesters threw bottles at officers, who dispersed the crowd near Beale Street, the historic tourist district known for its blues bars. Police said people fired shots at officers on two different occasions at other locations early Sunday. No officers were hit. A total of eight people were arrested. Protest organizers claim police escalated Saturday’s incident on Beale Street, which came two hours after the peaceful protest ended. Elsewhere, Gov. Bill Lee announced Sunday that the Tennessee Highway Patrol and National Guard would be mobilized because of demonstrations in Murfreesboro — where a 7 p.m. curfew was put in place. Lee, a Republican, had previously authorized more than 300 National Guard troops to help assist with the Nashville protest, which turned violent after protesters peacefully met earlier that Saturday. “The protests in Murfreesboro are no longer peaceful demonstrations but have escalated to overt threats to public safety and property,” Lee said in a statement. A separate demonstration was also held in Chattanooga, where police tackled a small handful of people and arrested one of them when protesters removed a light fixture at the Hamilton County Courthouse, according to the Times Free Press. The newspaper reports that sheriff’s deputies came out of the building with non-lethal weapons as the crowd yelled “Don’t do it” to those attempting to throw a banner at the top of the stairs of the courthouse. Meanwhile, Nashville’s honky tonks and other businesses spent Sunday largely boarding up their smashed store fronts, as cleanup crews began scrubbing graffiti and removing debris. According to Metro Nashville Police, at least 30 businesses and buildings were damaged after a peaceful “I Will Breathe” demonstration turned violent on Saturday. Fires were lit inside and outside the city’s historic courthouse, and a statue of a former state lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views was toppled. Only until a 10 p.m. curfew was ordered did the protesters finally begin to disperse. By Sunday, the same area was quiet with business owners covering up smashed windows as spectators somberly took photos of the destruction. Yet the emotions of the night were still being felt as one black man stood quietly holding one arm up watching the courthouse be cleaned. Mayor John Cooper described Saturday as a “heartbreaking night” for Nashville, noting that the area had recently already been ravaged by a fatal tornado nearly three months before that shortly followed the COVID-19 pandemic. Cooper ordered a new curfew of 8 p.m. Sunday night. He and other community leaders, lamented that most of the destruction centered around Metro Nashville Courthouse and City Hall, where multiple fires went off in and around the building after protesters smashed in windows and spray-painted obscenities along the walls and nearby structures. “Our metro courthouse, iconic for its role in the civil rights movement, was the site of much of tonight’s reprehensible vandalism,” Cooper said. “Sixty years ago, 3,000 nonviolent protesters marched to that same courthouse in a milestone moment for integration and yet tonight that same courthouse was defaced and set on fire.” In 1960, area college student leaders in the sit-in movement challenged the injustice of segregated lunch counters in a confrontation on the courthouse steps. After the mayor agreed that it was wrong, Nashville became the first southern city in the U.S. to desegregate its lunch counters. Metro Nashville Police tweeted that 28 people were arrested during the protest and four others were arrested after a 10 p.m. curfew was implemented Saturday evening. Demonstrators earlier in the evening pulled down a statue outside the state Capitol of Edward Carmack. Carmack was a politician in the early 1900s who wrote editorials lambasting the writings of prominent Tennessee civil rights journalist Ida B. Wells. He was fatally shot in 1908 by a political rival.",0.0

(NEXSTAR/AP) – After six straight days of unrest, America heads into a new work week with neighborhoods in shambles, urban streets on lockdown and political leaders struggling to control the coast-to-coast outpouring of rage over police killings of black people. Despite curfews in big cities across the U.S. and the deployment of thousands of National Guard soldiers over the past week, demonstrations descended into violence again on Sunday.

Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin, Texas, and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them first, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis.

In other places, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators. The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Breonna Taylor to death in her home in March. The upheaval has unfolded amid the gloom and economic ruin caused by the coronavirus, which has killed over 100,000 Americans and sent unemployment soaring to levels not seen since the Depression. The outbreak has hit minorities especially hard, not just in infections and deaths but in job losses and economic stress. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests has rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count compiled by The Associated Press. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name!” Protesters hold signs in Detroit, Michigan on May 31, 2020 following a night of protests that saw several arrests and use of tear gas by the Detroit Police department. (Photo by SETH HERALD/AFP via Getty Images) At the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, police fired tear gas and stun grenades Sunday into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a street nearby. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the flames. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office was burned down. The district’s entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to Pentagon officials. As the unrest grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton, who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to demonstrators. He also wrote a post online expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. In New York, thieves raided luxury stores, including Chanel, Rolex and Prada boutiques. In Birmingham, Alabama, a Confederate statute was toppled. A demonstrator is arrested during a protest against police brutality and the death of George Floyd, on May 31, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Thousands marched peacefully in Phoenix; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying the destruction weakens calls for justice and reform. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said t wo officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday and using stun guns on the man and woman inside. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. Scores of people swarmed into stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) In Minneapolis, the officer who pinned Floyd to the pavement has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest, but thousands marching on a closed freeway were shaken when a tractor-trailer rolled into their midst. No serious injuries were reported. The driver was arrested on suspicion of assault. In tweets Sunday, Trump accused anarchists and the media of fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems.

(WATE) — After what police are calling a riot broke out in Market Square Saturday night, local activists are condemning violent demonstrations. Saturday night, rioters broke multiple windows of local businesses, also damaging some large flower pots and turning over several trash cans in the area. Local activist Constance Every says the Black Lives Matter movement had nothing to do with Saturday night’s riot. Every says she does not support these kinds of demonstrations. “I do discourage those types of movements because unfortunately when you don’t have your organization leadership in place to help assist those type of protest and demonstrations, you lead people more into a death trap. Do not be counterproductive to the movements that are already taking place that are successful and does have their leaderships attention.” Constance Every, Black Lives Matter Knoxville After a peaceful protest Friday, Every says violent demonstrations like what occurred in Market Square, take away from the overall purpose of the protests. “Police brutality is the forefront of this. Don’t allow some of these unorganized protests that may have caused some minor distractions in your area be the distraction that takes the focus away from the main principle. If you have the demeanor to want to be violent and you’re doing unorganized protesting, understand you are going to be met with violence, and we are not trying to lose lives in our demonstrations, we are trying to gain and save lives through these demonstrations.” Constance Every, Black Lives Matter Knoxville Ruby Sunshine was one of the businesses that sustained damage. In security footage obtained by the Knoxville Police Department, you can see rioters throwing large objects at the windows of the restaurant. A few seconds later, another person comes along throwing another large object at the back window of the building, penetrating it. “Let’s not hurt anybody, lets not make it harder for local businesses. It’s a hard enough time as it is. If there’s going to be a protest do it peacefully. There’s not a reason to hurt other people or other businesses that don’t have any part of it.” said Ruby Sunshine general manager, Danielle Wolfe. The Knoxville Chamber building also suffered a broken window. In a statement, chamber representatives say they are focusing on solutions. “The damage is minor and, as an organization, we are more focused on how we can collaborate on solutions that make everyone in our region feel safe, secure and included.” Lynsey Wilson, VP, Marketing & Events for Knoxville Chamber Ruby Sunshine is still open and operating.

As is the case in many cities across the United States, people are protesting the slaying of George Floyd in Minneapolis, who was pinned to the ground by police officer Derek Chauvin for over eight minutes. After an entirely-peaceful gathering at the back of the old courthouse at 1:30, there was a break in the action until 6:00, when protesters once again gathered at Coolidge Park. “Being black should not be a crime,” said one of the activists, while another said, “It’s not brutality, it’s murder.” Another said, “This is a lynching in broad daylight.” There were several chants exclaimed by the crowd, including “(expletive) 12” and “No Justice No Peace.” When asked when there would be peace, one speaker said, “All of them deserve life (in prison).” Officer Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in Minnesota. When Marie Mott had the microphone, she implored Chattanoogans to force change by voting and filling out the census. One speaker asked a question that resonated with the very diverse crowd. “The man said ‘I can’t breathe,’ what more do you want,” asked one woman when she had the microphone. One common theme among the protesters was their desire to reform policing in America, which includes heightened accountability for officers who may have committed a wrongdoing. Multiple speakers spoke about how they have been stereotyped by law enforcement because of their race. “The laws weren’t written for people with our skin color,” said one protester. “And you wonder why I’m angry?” Following over an hour at Coolidge, the group of around 400 people crossed the walking bridge and made their way to the old Courthouse. Many stood on the front steps, and one activist began several more of the same chants from before, which also included “Hands up, don’t shoot” and “I can’t breathe.” After this, protesters meandered toward the back of the building, where a few tore down some sort of banner strung between the two lamp posts on the upper part of the stairs. After this, law enforcement arrested the instigators of this act. While this arrest was happening and people were still present on the stairs, someone threw fireworks into the general area. This prompted Hamilton County sheriff deputies to fire tear gas at the protesters, which cleared the balcony. The two sides followed this up by creating essentially two lines, with law enforcement on one side, and protesters on the other. Protesters continued to chant various things at the officers. However, there did not appear to be any physical altercations after the tear gas situation. From there, the protesters moved down Market Street and across the bridge back into the Coolidge Park and Northshore area. At this point, law enforcement personnel blocked off different parts of the street along Frazier Avenue. The National Guard then came in, and with the assistance of other law enforcement, they began to push protesters back and into Coolidge Park from Frazier. However, this was a lengthy and drawn-out process. Before and during this de-escalation, a few arrests were made and there were several rowdy protesters who appeared to try to provoke the guard into some sort of altercation. Multiple protesters seemed to be unsettled when it became widespread knowledge that there was also armed law enforcement on the roof of one of the taller buildings. However, for the most part, both sides stayed relatively calm, even as unknown parties occasionally threw fireworks into the crowds of people or at law enforcement. Protesters did continue to yell at the National Guard and law enforcement as the protesters were being pushed back into Coolidge. One man was stuck at the protest for hours because the way to his house was completely blocked by police cars. Others stayed for most of the protest, but numbers began to dwindle as space became cramped on the street because of encroaching law enforcement. By 1 a.m., the protest was mostly done, aside from a small pocket of people still congregating close to the Walgreens. In all, the only property damage appeared to be to the lamppost at the old courthouse.",0.0

Chattanooga Police said afterward the tear gas was thrown by the Sheriff's Office and not the city police. City Police also said they were not given warning that the tear gas was going to be used. In another tense night in downtown Chattanooga, some in the group knocked off a light post at the historic building, prompting the move to force them down. A witness said, ""They were on the steps of the courthouse on the jail side on Walnut Street. Some of the protesters went to the top of the steps and were pulling on a banner that was strung between two light posts. ""The posts were not very well supported and one started teetering when they were pulling on the banner. The original intent did not appear to be vandalism other than taking down the banner.   ""Law enforcement ran up the stairs and threw the two to the ground and handcuffed them. People got upset.    ""Some of them started approaching the officers. Many, many more officers came up the steps to hold them back. There was a little tussle at one point, but then everyone was staying back while officers were pointing very large guns at the crowd - maybe rubber bullet guns? maybe tear gas?   ""Then a couple of minutes later they fired the tear gas and everyone dispersed temporarily and went back around to the other side of the courthouse.""   Just as quickly, the protestors headed back toward Coolidge Park, where speakers on bullhorns had been denouncing the action of Minneapolis Police in the death of George Floyd. A number of those in the crowd held signs denouncing racism. In North Chattanooga as midnight approached, members of the National Guard joined with law enforcement at the intersection of Market Street and Frazier Avenue. They stood at the edge of the street holding weapons and wearing riot gear. Protestors milled around and periodically there were sounds that appeared to be fireworks that startled the crowd. Earlier in the standoff at the courthouse on the Georgia Avenue side, protestors on their knees had chanted ""Hands Up. Don't Shoot."" There was an earlier protest on Sunday afternoon at the County Courthouse with local activist Marie Mott exhorting a small group. Mayor Andy Berke, who had not commented following a night of violence and 11 arrests on Saturday, issued this statement on Sunday night, “We encourage everyone in Chattanooga to exercise their First Amendment rights and express themselves in a safe way.” Following incidents of violence in downtown Nashville, Governor Bill Lee announced Sunday that the Tennessee National Guard will remain mobilized across the state and that the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, in coordination with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement authorities, will launch an investigation into unlawful incidents that occurred overnight. “The right to peaceful protest is foundational to our country, but the violence and vandalism that occurred in Nashville last night was unlawful and tears at the fabric of our community,” said Governor Lee. “We have reason to believe that many of those involved in unlawful acts are not Tennesseans and we will be working with law enforcement to investigate this further and bring those responsible to justice.” National Guard personnel are now mobilized across all three Grand Divisions to assist state and local law enforcement. The Tennessee National Guard stands ready, in partnership with local law enforcement, the Department of Safety, and TEMA, to ensure order and safety are maintained in the supported areas for as long as is warranted by the situation. In addition to support from the Guard, Governor Lee has authorized the continuation of a curfew in Nashville and will support similar measures in other Tennessee cities as requested. Curfew in the downtown Nashville area and Urban Services District of Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County will be effective 8 p.m. CDT on Sunday and will continue until 6 a.m. CDT on Monday. The curfew will not apply to law enforcement and fire department personnel, first responders, and other officials assisting with maintaining public safety, including medical personnel in the performance of their duties, and any other persons lawfully on the streets and in public places with permission from law enforcement personnel. Governor Bill Lee also issued the following statement: “The protests in Murfreesboro are no longer peaceful demonstrations but have escalated to overt threats to public safety and property. I support Mayor McFarland’s 7 p.m. curfew and have authorized both the Tennessee Highway Patrol and the National Guard to provide support on the ground in restoring order for the safety of our citizens.”   ",0.0

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote. This is the same bunker Vice President Dick Cheney was brought after the September 11 attacks when authorities feared a hijacked plane hijacked was heading toward the White House. President George W. Bush, when he returned to D.C. later that evening, was later taken there after a false alarm of another plane.

More than 4,400 arrests have been made at protests nationwide since viral video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day, resulting in Floyd's death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the incident was the right thing to do. Peaceful protests continued to be marred by violence. The Minneapolis Department of Public safety confirmed a semi-truck drove into a group of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35. The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Elsewhere, vandalism and looting continued across the country, as did the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by police in confrontations with protesters. Reports: President Trump hustled to bunker amid Washington protests President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion, according to multiple outlets. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Dozens of Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters over the weekend, and videos showed a large group of protesters – some burning flags and knocking over barricades. CNN reported that the president remained in the bunker for about an hour before returning to the residence, and it is currently unknown whether the First Lady and their son, Barron, were with him. – Savannah Behrmann 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. Illinois governor calls on National Guard to assist Chicago police Vandalism and fires were reported in several Chicago neighborhoods and some suburbs Sunday night after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot severely restricted access to downtown following nights of violent protests. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. ""This has been a scary and unsettling time, but I know we will get through this and begin the process of healing together,"" Lightfoot said in a midnight Twitter post. ""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Protesters vandalize, set fire to police SUVs in New Jersey A group of people was captured on video destroying police SUVs in Trenton, New Jersey. In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared.

(AP) — Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group fired at them first, the city’s police chief said. Chief Steve Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. outside a food market on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a large group of people gathering in defiance of the city’s curfew. Someone fired a shot at them and both soldiers and officers returned fire, the chief said. It was unclear if the person killed is the one who fired at the law enforcers. Several “persons of interest” were being interviewed, he said. News outlets showed video taken by someone in a car parked at a gas station. It recorded the sound of bullets being fired as groups of police and national guard soldiers crouched behind cars. “It has been a very difficult four days for our city. Our officers are working very hard to keep people safe,” Conrad said. “While doing that, we’ve had officers shot at and assaulted. I think it’s very, very clear that many people do not trust the police. That is an issue that we’re going to have to work on and work through for a long time.” Gov. Andy Beshear said he authorized state police to independently investigate Monday morning’s shooting, which he said happened as police and guardsmen were fired on while dispersing a crowd. Last week, before the Kentucky National Guard was mobilized, seven people were wounded when gunshots erupted during a protest in downtown Louisville. Police said none of the seven, who are recovering, were shot by police. They have not announced any arrests. Protesters have been demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her home in Louisville. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. More than two months after her death, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced last week that police are suspending the use of these no-knock search warrants.",0.0

1622409011,2020-06-01 12:08:35,What is antifa and what does the movement want?,https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/zz/news/20200601/what-is-antifa-and-what-does-movement-want?rssfeed=true,en,False,,106478,columbiadailyherald.com,http://columbiadailyherald.com/,"Antifa — short for ""anti-fascist"" — is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0

Wesley Somers, 25, is charged with felony arson, vandalism and disorderly conduct. He is accused of setting fire to Nashville's Historic Courthouse on Saturday night. Metro Nashville Police said Somers was among 29 people arrested after protesters in Tennessee's capital set fires inside and outside the courthouse and toppled a statue of a former state lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views. Protesters damaged 30 businesses. In addition to the courthouse, the Ryman Auditorium, known as the mother church of country music, was damaged, police said. Others who were arrested face charges that include assaulting police officers, disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing, police said. It wasn't immediately clear whether Somers has an attorney. Separate demonstrations were held in Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, and Memphis, where protesters made it onto Interstate 55, circumventing officers in riot gear. ___ BERLIN — Protests against the death of George Floyd continued for a third day in Berlin, though the gathering outside the U.S. embassy Monday was significantly smaller than earlier rallies. Police said about 1,500 people took part in a march Sunday in the German capital's hip Kreuzberg district, after about 2,000 people staged a protest in front of the embassy Saturday. Paul Schreiner, 69 and originally from Wisconsin, was among a dozen people holding a vigil outside the embassy Monday. ""It's my duty, I feel, to be here,"" he said. ""There's a very interesting phrase that 'white silence is violence,' and that moved me to make sure I came today.""

Plywood covered the windows of several shuttered businesses along one heavily traveled street leading to the White House, but a McDonald's that Bill Clinton frequented as president remained open, albeit with plywood structures reinforcing its street-facing windows. Blocks away, the windows of a major bank branch had been shattered and its exterior scrawled with expletive-filled graffiti expressing displeasure with such institutions. ___ SAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco police officers seized firearms and explosives and arrested at least 80 people Sunday night on violating a curfew and looting charges. San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said demonstrations that drew about 1,000 people carrying signs and chanting ""George Floyd"" and ""Black lives matter"" were overwhelmingly peaceful Sunday and the vast majority of demonstrators dispersed without incident before the 8 p.m. curfew. But a relatively small number of ""defiant individuals"" who had gathered in the Civic Center area refused to disperse, threw bottles at officers and started trash fires, Scott said. In response, officers and deputies with the sheriff's office began making arrests, he said. ___ INDIANAPOLIS — An overnight curfew imposed by Indianapolis' mayor after two nights of violent protest over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans was followed by a night of relative calm after a weekend that left the city with widespread damage downtown, a police spokesman said Monday. Officer William Young of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said the city ""was relatively quiet"" during the overnight curfew, in comparison to violent weekend protests during which demonstrators broke dozens of windows on downtown businesses and set fires. He said police planned to release a tally later Monday of arrests that occurred during the curfew that ran from 8 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m. Monday. Curfew violators were subject to arrest and fines. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The attorney for George Floyd's family was set to announce findings Monday of an independent autopsy into his death a week ago after a Minneapolis officer held his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes. Floyd, a black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died after the white officer ignored bystander shouts to get off him and Floyd's cries that he couldn't breathe. His death, captured on citizen video, sparked days of protests in Minneapolis that have spread to cities around America. An official autopsy last week said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller described the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as ""awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself."" The criminal complaint noted that the medical examiner's report was preliminary, but said the autopsy ""revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation."" Ben Crump, the attorney representing Floyd's family, said last week that he was commissioning the family's own autopsy. ___ MADISON, Wisconsin — Fifteen people were arrested after a second night of violence erupted Sunday night in Madison, Wisconsin, with police firing tear gas as protesters again threw rocks and damaged store downtown stores following an afternoon peaceful protest over the death of George Floyd. There were also protests in Milwaukee and Racine on Sunday night, continuing a weekend of unrest both in Wisconsin and across the country in reaction to Floyd's death. Madison police reported Monday that multiple stores were looted in the State Street area, a business corridor that connects the state Capitol to the University of Wisconsin campus. One of the 15 people arrested was armed with a handgun, police said. There were multiple unsuccessful attempts to steal a police squad car, the police said. A protest Sunday night in Milwaukee was mostly peaceful, but a crowd that gathered outside of a city police station was dispersed with tear gas. National Guard troops were deployed in both Madison and Milwaukee to assist local law enforcement. In Racine, about 150 people marched to the police station where they threw rocks at police who were wearing riot gear. The crowd dispersed after police fired tear gas. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Authorities say the driver of a semitrailer who rolled into the midst of thousands of people marching on a closed Minneapolis freeway over the death of George Floyd has been arrested on suspicion of assault. Authorities had said it appeared no one was hurt Sunday but some witnesses said a handful of people who were on Interstate 35W near downtown Minneapolis sought medical attention on their own. Authorities said they could not confirm that. The freeway was among many shut down in the Minneapolis area for the second night in a row as officials imposed an 8 p.m. curfew and sought to make it more difficult for protesters to move around. Bystander video showed the crowd parting seconds before the semi rolled through, then the tanker truck gradually slowed and demonstrators swarmed the truck. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Sunday that it initially appeared from traffic camera footage that the semitrailer was already on the freeway before barricades were set up at 5 p.m. State Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said at a later briefing, however, that the truck went around a traffic barrier to stay on the road. ___ LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman says arrests and assaults on journalists covering protests in the United States are ""very concerning."" James Slack said Monday that ""journalists all around the world must be free to do their job and to hold authorities to account without fear of arrest or violence."" He said the violence of the past few nights was ""very alarming. People must be allowed to protest peacefully."" Slack said ""the footage of George Floyd's death was deeply distressing and our thoughts are with all those who have been affected."" Noting that a police officer has been charged with murder, he said ""we would hope and expect justice to be done."" ___ LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The police chief of Louisville, Kentucky, says police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group fired at them first. Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. outside a business on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a large group of people gathering in defiance of the city's curfew. Someone fired a shot at them and the officers returned fire, the chief said. It was unclear if the person killed is the one who fired at the law enforcers, he said. Protests have erupted in Louisville over the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door, as well as the death of George Floyd. ___ SIOUX FALLS, S.D. — South Dakota Gov. Governor Kristi Noem activated the National Guard after protests in Sioux Fall turned violent over the death of George Floyd. The protest in South Dakota's largest city started Sunday afternoon with a march downtown. Police said dozens of protesters later congregated at the Empire Mall and began throwing rocks at officers and breaking windows. Police said protesters had dispersed by 11 p.m. Noem said about 70 Guard members are in Sioux Falls and will remain until they are no longer needed. ___ PARIS — In France, family and friends of a French black man who died shortly after he was arrested by police in 2016 have called for a protest on Tuesday which will also pay homage to George Floyd. The circumstances of the death of Adama Traore, a French 24-old-man of Malian origin, are still under investigation by justice authorities. Calls for Tuesday's protest in front of the Paris court come after some medical experts last week attributed the death to a cardiac problem, the latest in a series of conflicting medical assessments. French police claimed Traore died of a heart attack due to pre-existing medical condition. His family said he died from asphyxiation from police tactics. In a video message published on social media, Traore's sister Assa Traore calls for protesters to express their indignation ""at a time when the world, when France is outraged by the death of George Floyd."" She said ""they had the same words, their last words: 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe.'"" She denounced the latest medical experts' report as ""racist"" and ""untrue."" The family wants the officers in charge of Traore's arrest to go on trial. ___ ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico — A protest along the historic Route 66 into downtown Albuquerque turned violent early Monday after police reported demonstrators setting small fires and officers say they were fired upon. Albuquerque police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos says officers reported shots fired at them in front of the historic Kimo Theater early Monday after a mostly peaceful demonstration disbanded. Gallego said there was damage to several properties in the area, including broken windows and some stealing from stores. No injuries were reported. Before the chaos, hundreds of people on Sunday marched down historic Route 66, protesting the death of George Floyd. Protesters in New Mexico's largest city held signs, wore masks and chanted, ""Say his name: George Floyd"" and ""Hands up, don't shoot."" Activist Arthur Bell told protesters there will be another demonstration Monday evening in front of Albuquerque Police Department headquarters, but that rally will be ""different."" When The Associated Press asked Bell what he meant by ""different,"" he said: ""A general never gives out his tactics."" ___ SYDNEY — Fearful of conflict, organizers have canceled a peaceful protest planned for Sydney over the death of George Floyd in the United States. A rally planned at Sydney's downtown Hyde Park for Tuesday was canceled on Monday after people threatened to create ""havoc and protest against the event,"" an organizer said on social media. The rally was presented as a peaceful protest against the overrepresentation of indigenous Australians in Australia's criminal justice system as well as in solidarity for Floyd who was ""brutally and inhumanly murdered."" Organizers posted that ""although Australia is far from where the murder took place, we have a voice."" Thousands of protesters are expected at similar rallies planned for the Australian cities of Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide on Saturday. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Sydney Radio 2GB on Monday ""there's no need to import things ... happening in other countries here to Australia,"" referring to U.S. riots. ___ TEHRAN, Iran — In Iran, which has in the recent past violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. Foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi urged the U.S. government and police to stop the violence against their own people during a press conference in Tehran on Monday. ""To American officials and police! Stop violence against your people and let them breathe,"" Mousavi said and also sent a message to the American people that ""the world is standing with you."" He added that Iran is saddened to see ""the violence the U.S. police have recently"" set off. ___",0.0

1622433245,2020-06-01 12:03:54,Biden meets with black leaders at local church amid unrest,http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129784,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 Biden meets with black leaders at local church amid unrest Print | Front Page | Email this story To:  From:  Message: From (email):  Message:  WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Joe Biden vowed to address ""institutional racism"" in his first 100 days in office as he met with community leaders at a predominantly African American church in Delaware Monday morning, leaving home for a second consecutive day to address exploding racial tensions that have begun to reshape the upcoming presidential election. Biden, the former vice president who will represent Democrats on the ballot against President Donald Trump this fall, has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his basement television studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, the 77-year-old Democrat gathered with roughly a dozen local black leaders during an intimate meeting in his hometown ahead of a virtual meeting with mayors from Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Paul, Minnesota. ""Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,"" Biden said, his face mask lowered around his chin, after several participants shared their thoughts on police brutality. If elected, he promised to ""deal with institutional racism"" and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office. His low-key, high-touch approach marked a sharp contrast to that of Trump in recent days, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president was scheduled to speak to governors and law enforcement officials on Monday, but he spent much of the weekend using Twitter as a bullhorn to urge ""law and order"" and tougher action by police against protesters around the country. He warned Friday that, ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Trump also lashed out at Biden Monday, tweeting that ""Sleepy Joe Biden's people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more."" In the early moments of Monday's gathering at the Bethel AME church in Biden's hometown of Wilmington, the former vice president listened quietly and took notes in a spiral notebook. All of the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks. ""The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,"" said Pastor Sylvester Beaman, before Biden and those present bowed their heads in prayer. Biden's softer approach may foreshadow how the presumptive Democratic nominee presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by the much louder, more persistent voice of Trump. ""He's not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,"" said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. ""America just needs to be reassured that there's someone who's understanding, someone who's willing to say, 'Yes, we do have some issues,' and someone who's willing to address it."" Reassurance requires presence, though, and that has been a hurdle for the former vice president, driven inside by the coronavirus pandemic, still working to adapt to the power of social media as a substitute and without the natural platform of a public office. Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America's systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden. Monday marked just his third public appearance since the pandemic exploded in mid-March. Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veteran's memorial near his Wilmington home last week, and the former vice president's campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in another part of the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd. Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign earlier in the spring, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large number in November. ""I want to make something clear. I don't expect anything from the black community,"" he said Monday, insisting that he has never taken their support for granted. The morning gathering featured 15 invited religious, political and educational leaders, including Delaware Democratic Rep. Blunt Rochester. They all wore masks and spaced out among the wooden pews. Pasted notices on the main entrance cautioned people from entering if they had a cough or other symptoms that could indicate they were suffering from coronavirus. The speakers, including Biden, lowered their masks as they took turns speaking. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He's called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. Democrats believe the former vice president draws a contrast with Trump in such moments that works in his favor. They note that while Biden didn't appear on television all weekend, he spoke about Floyd's death before Trump addressed it and has shown compassion for the protesters. Trump has alternated between expressing alarm over Floyd's death and sympathy for his family and issuing tweets antagonizing protesters and disparaging his political enemies. And in an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. And some Democrats who have criticized Biden in the past for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now.

1622433226,2020-06-01 11:57:12,Police arrest man in arson of historic Nashville courthouse,http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129775,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 NASHVILLE (AP) — A man who set fire to a historic courthouse in Tennessee during weekend protests has been arrested, police said. Wesley Somers, 25, is charged with felony arson, vandalism and disorderly conduct. He is accused of setting fire Saturday night to Nashville's Historic Courthouse, Metro Nashville Police said. Somers was among 29 people arrested after protesters in Tennessee's capital set fires inside and outside the courthouse and toppled a statue of a former state lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views. Protesters damaged 30 businesses and buildings including the courthouse and the historic Ryman Auditorium, known as the mother church of country music, which reported window damage, police said. Thousands had rallied near the state Capitol starting Saturday afternoon to protest police brutality and racism. The demonstration turned violent after darkness fell. Others who were arrested face charges that include assaulting police officers, disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing, police said. It wasn't immediately clear whether Somers has an attorney. The demonstrations spreading across America were also held around Tennessee over the weekend in response to the latest killings of black people by police. After peaceful protests turned violent each night, strict curfews were imposed in places and the National Guard was mobilized to support police. Separate demonstrations were held in Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, and Memphis, where protesters made it onto Interstate 55, circumventing officers in riot gear. Protesters chanted ""Black lives matter"" and ""George Floyd."" It marked the fifth night in a row people had met in Memphis to protest the death of Floyd, who died last week after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck. Sunday night was the most intense yet for Memphis, where the group walked from the interstate to Beale Street and were met by officers wearing helmets and holding protective shields in front of the FedExForum, the NBA basketball arena and concert venue. The National Guard and sheriff's deputies joined Memphis police in response, and tear gas was used to disperse a crowd near City Hall. Windows were broken at a handful of businesses, including a black-owned shoe store.",0.0

What's next for Minneapolis-area small business owners in danger of losing livelihoods?",https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/zz/news/20200601/their-stores-were-burned-ransacked-and-looted-whats-next-for-minneapolis-area-small-business-owners-in-danger-of-losing-livelihoods?rssfeed=true,en,False,,106478,columbiadailyherald.com,http://columbiadailyherald.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS — Brandy Moore likened the charred remains of her south Minneapolis clothing store and recording studio to the pangs for equality that minorities here feel. Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

On Sunday, protesters, who marched through Downtown and one point made it to I-55 and proceeded down the highway, were met with police in riot gear.

Wesley Somers, 25, is charged with felony arson, vandalism and disorderly conduct. He is accused of setting fire to Nashville’s Historic Courthouse on Saturday night. Metro Nashville Police said Somers was among 29 people arrested after protesters in Tennessee’s capital set fires inside and outside the courthouse and toppled a statue of a former state lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views.

Separate demonstrations were held in Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, and Memphis, where protesters made it onto Interstate 55, circumventing officers in riot gear. BERLIN — Protests against the death of George Floyd continued for a third day in Berlin, though the gathering outside the U.S. embassy Monday was significantly smaller than earlier rallies. Police said about 1,500 people took part in a march Sunday in the German capital’s hip Kreuzberg district, after about 2,000 people staged a protest in front of the embassy Saturday. Paul Schreiner, 69 and originally from Wisconsin, was among a dozen people holding a vigil outside the embassy Monday. “It’s my duty, I feel, to be here,” he said. “There’s a very interesting phrase that ‘white silence is violence,’ and that moved me to make sure I came today.” Holding a sign with the names of George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and others, American citizen Carmen Osorio Rodrigues said she was concerned about the direction the United States is heading. “We have to confront these social injustices,” she said, adding: “We need clear leadership on how to act.” WASHINGTON — Evidence of the chaos that erupted around the White House was visible as people streamed to work Monday morning. Plywood covered the windows of several shuttered businesses along one heavily traveled street leading to the White House, but a McDonald’s that Bill Clinton frequented as president remained open, albeit with plywood structures reinforcing its street-facing windows. Blocks away, the windows of a major bank branch had been shattered and its exterior scrawled with expletive-filled graffiti expressing displeasure with such institutions. SAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco police officers seized firearms and explosives and arrested at least 80 people Sunday night on violating a curfew and looting charges. San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said demonstrations that drew about 1,000 people carrying signs and chanting “George Floyd” and “Black lives matter” were overwhelmingly peaceful Sunday and the vast majority of demonstrators dispersed without incident before the 8 p.m. curfew. But a relatively small number of “defiant individuals” who had gathered in the Civic Center area refused to disperse, threw bottles at officers and started trash fires, Scott said. In response, officers and deputies with the sheriff’s office began making arrests, he said. INDIANAPOLIS — An overnight curfew imposed by Indianapolis’ mayor after two nights of violent protest over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans was followed by a night of relative calm after a weekend that left the city with widespread damage downtown, a police spokesman said Monday. Officer William Young of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said the city “was relatively quiet” during the overnight curfew, in comparison to violent weekend protests during which demonstrators broke dozens of windows on downtown businesses and set fires. He said police planned to release a tally later Monday of arrests that occurred during the curfew that ran from 8 p.m. Sunday until 6 a.m. Monday. Curfew violators were subject to arrest and fines. MINNEAPOLIS — The attorney for George Floyd’s family was set to announce findings Monday of an independent autopsy into his death a week ago after a Minneapolis officer held his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. Floyd, a black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died after the white officer ignored bystander shouts to get off him and Floyd’s cries that he couldn’t breathe. His death, captured on citizen video, sparked days of protests in Minneapolis that have spread to cities around America. An official autopsy last week said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller described the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” The criminal complaint noted that the medical examiner’s report was preliminary, but said the autopsy “revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” Ben Crump, the attorney representing Floyd’s family, said last week that he was commissioning the family’s own autopsy. MADISON, Wisconsin — Fifteen people were arrested after a second night of violence erupted Sunday night in Madison, Wisconsin, with police firing tear gas as protesters again threw rocks and damaged store downtown stores following an afternoon peaceful protest over the death of George Floyd. There were also protests in Milwaukee and Racine on Sunday night, continuing a weekend of unrest both in Wisconsin and across the country in reaction to Floyd’s death. Madison police reported Monday that multiple stores were looted in the State Street area, a business corridor that connects the state Capitol to the University of Wisconsin campus. One of the 15 people arrested was armed with a handgun, police said. There were multiple unsuccessful attempts to steal a police squad car, the police said. A protest Sunday night in Milwaukee was mostly peaceful, but a crowd that gathered outside of a city police station was dispersed with tear gas. National Guard troops were deployed in both Madison and Milwaukee to assist local law enforcement. In Racine, about 150 people marched to the police station where they threw rocks at police who were wearing riot gear. The crowd dispersed after police fired tear gas. MINNEAPOLIS — Authorities say the driver of a semitrailer who rolled into the midst of thousands of people marching on a closed Minneapolis freeway over the death of George Floyd has been arrested on suspicion of assault. Authorities had said it appeared no one was hurt Sunday but some witnesses said a handful of people who were on Interstate 35W near downtown Minneapolis sought medical attention on their own. Authorities said they could not confirm that. The freeway was among many shut down in the Minneapolis area for the second night in a row as officials imposed an 8 p.m. curfew and sought to make it more difficult for protesters to move around. Bystander video showed the crowd parting seconds before the semi rolled through, then the tanker truck gradually slowed and demonstrators swarmed the truck. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Sunday that it initially appeared from traffic camera footage that the semitrailer was already on the freeway before barricades were set up at 5 p.m. State Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said at a later briefing, however, that the truck went around a traffic barrier to stay on the road. LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman says arrests and assaults on journalists covering protests in the United States are “very concerning.” James Slack said Monday that “journalists all around the world must be free to do their job and to hold authorities to account without fear of arrest or violence.” He said the violence of the past few nights was “very alarming. People must be allowed to protest peacefully.” Slack said “the footage of George Floyd’s death was deeply distressing and our thoughts are with all those who have been affected.” Noting that a police officer has been charged with murder, he said “we would hope and expect justice to be done.” LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The police chief of Louisville, Kentucky, says police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group fired at them first. Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. outside a business on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a large group of people gathering in defiance of the city’s curfew. Someone fired a shot at them and the officers returned fire, the chief said. It was unclear if the person killed is the one who fired at the law enforcers, he said. Protests have erupted in Louisville over the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door, as well as the death of George Floyd. SIOUX FALLS, S.D. — South Dakota Gov. Governor Kristi Noem activated the National Guard after protests in Sioux Fall turned violent over the death of George Floyd. The protest in South Dakota’s largest city started Sunday afternoon with a march downtown. Police said dozens of protesters later congregated at the Empire Mall and began throwing rocks at officers and breaking windows. Police said protesters had dispersed by 11 p.m. Noem said about 70 Guard members are in Sioux Falls and will remain until they are no longer needed. PARIS — In France, family and friends of a French black man who died shortly after he was arrested by police in 2016 have called for a protest on Tuesday which will also pay homage to George Floyd. The circumstances of the death of Adama Traore, a French 24-old-man of Malian origin, are still under investigation by justice authorities. Calls for Tuesday’s protest in front of the Paris court come after some medical experts last week attributed the death to a cardiac problem, the latest in a series of conflicting medical assessments. French police claimed Traore died of a heart attack due to pre-existing medical condition. His family said he died from asphyxiation from police tactics. In a video message published on social media, Traore’s sister Assa Traore calls for protesters to express their indignation “at a time when the world, when France is outraged by the death of George Floyd.” She said “they had the same words, their last words: ‘I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe.’” She denounced the latest medical experts’ report as “racist” and “untrue.” The family wants the officers in charge of Traore’s arrest to go on trial. ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico — A protest along the historic Route 66 into downtown Albuquerque turned violent early Monday after police reported demonstrators setting small fires and officers say they were fired upon. Albuquerque police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos says officers reported shots fired at them in front of the historic Kimo Theater early Monday after a mostly peaceful demonstration disbanded. Gallego said there was damage to several properties in the area, including broken windows and some stealing from stores. No injuries were reported. Before the chaos, hundreds of people on Sunday marched down historic Route 66, protesting the death of George Floyd. Protesters in New Mexico’s largest city held signs, wore masks and chanted, “Say his name: George Floyd” and “Hands up, don’t shoot.” Activist Arthur Bell told protesters there will be another demonstration Monday evening in front of Albuquerque Police Department headquarters, but that rally will be “different.” When The Associated Press asked Bell what he meant by “different,” he said: “A general never gives out his tactics.” SYDNEY — Fearful of conflict, organizers have canceled a peaceful protest planned for Sydney over the death of George Floyd in the United States. A rally planned at Sydney’s downtown Hyde Park for Tuesday was canceled on Monday after people threatened to create “havoc and protest against the event,” an organizer said on social media. The rally was presented as a peaceful protest against the overrepresentation of indigenous Australians in Australia’s criminal justice system as well as in solidarity for Floyd who was “brutally and inhumanly murdered.” Organizers posted that “although Australia is far from where the murder took place, we have a voice.” Thousands of protesters are expected at similar rallies planned for the Australian cities of Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide on Saturday. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Sydney Radio 2GB on Monday “there’s no need to import things ... happening in other countries here to Australia,” referring to U.S. riots. TEHRAN, Iran — In Iran, which has in the recent past violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. Foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi urged the U.S. government and police to stop the violence against their own people during a press conference in Tehran on Monday. “To American officials and police! Stop violence against your people and let them breathe,” Mousavi said and also sent a message to the American people that “the world is standing with you.” He added that Iran is saddened to see “the violence the U.S. police have recently” set off.",0.0

While many of the demonstrations around the country have been peaceful protests by racially diverse crowds, others have descended into violence, despite curfews in big cities across the U.S. and the deployment of thousands of National Guard soldiers over the past week. On Sunday, protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin, Texas, and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them first, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis. In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry, leaving shop owners, many of them just beginning to reopen their businesses after the coronavirus shutdowns, to clean up their shattered stores. In other places, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators. The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes. Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Breonna Taylor to death in her home in March. The upheaval has unfolded amid the gloom and economic ruin caused by the coronavirus, which has killed over 100,000 Americans and sent unemployment soaring to levels not seen since the Depression. The outbreak has hit minorities especially hard, not just in infections and deaths but in job losses and economic stress. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests has rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count compiled by The Associated Press. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name!” At the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, police fired tear gas and stun grenades Sunday into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a street nearby. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the flames. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office was burned down. The district’s entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to Pentagon officials. As the unrest grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton, who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, talked to demonstrators and wrote a post online expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. On Monday, Biden met with community leaders at a predominantly African American church. “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” said Sylvester Beaman, pastor of the Bethel AME church in Wilmington. In New York, thieves raided luxury stores, including Chanel, Rolex and Prada boutiques. In Birmingham, Alabama, a Confederate statute was toppled. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Thousands marched peacefully in Phoenix; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying the destruction weakens calls for justice and reform. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said t wo officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday and using stun guns on the man and woman inside. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. Scores of people swarmed into stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags. In Minneapolis, the officer who pinned Floyd to the pavement has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest, but thousands marching on a closed freeway were shaken when a tractor-trailer rolled into their midst. No serious injuries were reported. The driver was arrested on suspicion of assault. In tweets Sunday, Trump accused anarchists and the media of fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems.",0.0
1622457488,2020-06-01 00:00:00,Biden meets with black leaders at local church amid unrest,http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/Politics/2020/06/01/Biden-meets-with-black-leaders-at-local-church-amid-unrest.html,en,False,,94065,johnsoncitypress.com,http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/#spider,"Biden, the former vice president who will represent Democrats on the ballot against President Donald Trump this fall, has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his basement television studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, the 77-year-old Democrat gathered with roughly a dozen local black leaders during an intimate meeting in his hometown ahead of a virtual meeting with mayors from Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Paul, Minnesota. That low-key, high-touch approach marked a sharp contrast to that of Trump in recent days, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president was scheduled to speak to governors and law enforcement officials on Monday, but he spent much of the weekend using Twitter as a bullhorn to urge “law and order” and tougher action by police against protesters around the country. He warned Friday that, “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump also lashed out at Biden Monday, tweeting that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.” In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Biden’s hometown of Wilmington, the former vice president listened quietly and took notes in a spiral notebook. All of the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks. “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” said Pastor Sylvester Beaman, before Biden and those present bowed their heads in prayer. Biden’s softer approach may foreshadow how the presumptive Democratic nominee presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by the much louder, more persistent voice of Trump. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.” Reassurance requires presence, though, and that has been a hurdle for the former vice president, driven inside by the coronavirus pandemic, still working to adapt to the power of social media as a substitute and without the natural platform of a public office. Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden. Monday marked just his third public appearance since the pandemic exploded in mid-March. Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veteran’s memorial near his Wilmington home last week, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in another part of the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd. “The only way to bear this pain is to turn all that anguish to purpose,” Biden wrote in a message attached to the Sunday photo. “And as President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen.” Monday morning’s gathering featured 15 invited religious, political and educational leaders, including Delaware Democratic Rep. Blunt Rochester. They all wore masks and spaced out among the wooden pews. Pasted notices on the main entrance cautioned people from entering if they had a cough or other symptoms that could indicate they were suffering from coronavirus. Much of Biden’s campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He’s called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump’s handling of moments of racial tension. Democrats believe the former vice president draws a contrast with Trump in such moments that works in his favor. They note that while Biden didn’t appear on television all weekend, he spoke about Floyd’s death before Trump addressed it and has shown compassion for the protesters. Trump has alternated between expressing alarm over Floyd’s death and sympathy for his family and issuing tweets antagonizing protesters and disparaging his political enemies. And in an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. And some Democrats who have criticized Biden in the past for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. “I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That’s not who he is,” said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”",0.0
1622476749,2020-06-01 12:59:01,Will the Nashville protest lead to a surge of coronavirus? We will know in a week.,http://rssfeeds.tennessean.com/~/625782796/0/nashville/home~Will-the-Nashville-protest-lead-to-a-surge-of-coronavirus-We-will-know-in-a-week/,en,False,,73100,blogs.tennessean.com,http://blogs.tennessean.com/#spider,"It is not yet known if the large protest held in Nashville on Saturday has significantly spread the Tennessee coronavirus infection, but if it did then new cases of the virus will spike in a about week and virus-related deaths will increase in about two weeks. Public health experts said Monday that it generally takes five to seven days for symptoms of the virus to surface in new cases, and generally a little more than twice that long for the most severe cases of the virus to cause hospitalizations and deaths. Protests in Nashville and other cities will also likely “substantially inhibit” efforts to slow the virus through contact tracing, which is inherently dependent on trust in the government, said Dr. William Schaffner, a renown infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Contact tracing is a practice by which public health investigators meticulously interview people with coronavirus to find others who might also be infected. The tactic is reliant on people knowing who they spent time with and being willing to give this information to the government. “If there is not trust, these people who are asked are going to be reluctant to participate,” Schaffner said. “This is a particular concern in the African-American community, because that’s a community most affected and where the trust is least.” Thousands hit the streets of Nashville on Saturday for a peaceful rally followed by pockets of violence and vandalism that damaged city hall and other downtown buildings. A smaller vigil and protest followed in Murfreesboro on Sunday. Both events were spurred by the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed by a white police officer who pinned him to the ground with a knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25. The death has inflamed simmering tensions between people of color and law enforcement, leading to a week of rallies, protests, marches and riots in cities across the United States. NASHVILLE RIOT: Arrest made in historic Nashville courthouse fire Protest crowds gathered just as those same cities are attempting to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected about 1.7 million Americans and killed more than 103,000. In Nashville, the virus has been detected in 5,517 people – including 4,165 who have already recovered – and killed at least 63. The Nashville outbreak has plateaued in recent weeks, and city leaders have cautiously lifted restrictions on residents and businesses in an effort to return to a semblance of normal life. Dr. Alex Jahangir, chairman of the Nashville Board of Health and head of the city’s coronavirus task force, said he did not believe attendance at the protests alone was a reason to be tested for the virus. But Jahangir stressed anyone who develops symptoms should get tested and anyone who is “concerned” they were exposed is welcome to get tested, regardless of if they were at the protest or not. “The mere fact of being at any of the rallies or protests this weekend, I would not say you necessarily need to get tested,” Jahangir said. “But if you do need to be tested, or you are worried about it, we have community assessment centers and we have our hotline if you want to speak to someone further.” Schaffner described the protests as a worrisome combination of factors: Protesters spent hours in close proximity, shouting and chanting, potentially passing infected droplets back and forth; and because they were protesting racial injustice, many in the crowd were people of color, who already disproportionately affected by coronavirus. The only good news, he said, is the protests occurred outside, where the virus appears less likely to spread, and that many of the protesters wore masks. “And all of this happened as we were opening up society generally,” Schaffner said. “So if COVID-19 came to the demonstrations and was spread … it will be a little harder to determine if the demonstrations were the accelerator.” Brett Kelman is the health care reporter for The Tennessean.

I ran into the office of Springhill Suites hotel in downtown Memphis early this morning, listening to the voices of lawless youths trying to break the glass panels in the back. I prayed fervently — with tears. They kicked and banged against the double, glass doors of our historic Kress Building lobby, but finally, had to abandon the task. Memphis Police Department (MPD) officers, who were on Front Street engaged in a battle of their own, responded to our calls for help in seconds, quickly making a show of force on our parking lots in front and on the mall in back with police cars and flashing blue lights. When I heard the brief sirens announcing their presence, I felt safe coming out of the office. As I walked out, I saw people running through the alley, fleeing the clouds of tear gas on Front Street, not more than 50 feet from our front door. Some had their shirts off. Some ran past the front door, but I came face-to-face with a man who could not have been more than 25. He was short, about 5’6”, with a straggly blond beard. It was too late to run back into the office. He had already seen me. It was as if this man had no fear of the police. He stood in front of the hotel glass doors, which were locked from inside. They did not open automatically when he stepped closer. I prayed some more. He continued standing there, like he was trying to decide whether to force the doors open. Those two minutes seemed an eternity. Finally, he turned and ran away. When I arrived at 11 p.m., I was told by hotel personnel that protesters had gathered downtown, a peaceful demonstration, for the most part. I am tasked with auditing the day’s fiscal transactions some nights. We followed the movements of a segment of protesters near the bridge on I-40, tracking events in real time through Facebook Live reports from multiple people there on the scene. One hotel guest called from the Arkansas side, asking for help getting back across to Memphis. This was just before midnight. Confronted by a strong police presence, the swarm of protesters flowed to A.W. Willis. They flooded the parking lot of the corner gas station and store there, some trying to force their way into the store. There were hundreds of them. Police quickly moved in to disperse the crowd. Many were running, but the mass did not disperse. It moved south down Front Street and along Main Street. I knew it was headed our way. There are three hotels situated in a row. When they reached the Courtyard by Marriott, I got a call from the auditor, who was huddled behind the front desk. She yelled frantically into the phone, “They just threw a patio chair through the window. What should I do?” Our night maintenance man and security for all three hotels, “Mr. D,” ran down to ward off the attack. The auditor called back with a warning. “Mr. D said, ‘Lock yourself in the office, and don’t come out,’” the auditor told me. I immediately did so, praying as I huddled there alone, listening to the yelling and running outside. When all the vandals had either run through the alley from police, or been arrested, I ventured outside the hotel. Down at the Courtyard, a heavy, stylish metal chair had been flung into the glass window. The shards of glass were so thick and jagged, they would have sliced up anyone who tried to climb through. Shelby County Public Information Officer Capt. Anthony Buckner said the preference is for people to comply in situations like last night. “Our overarching goals are to preserve the peace and protect property,” said Buckner. “We always hope to earn voluntary compliance. We know that it’s important for people’s voices to be heard. We want that to happen. But when the peace is threatened and personal property must be protected, other means must be employed.” Reportedly, law enforcement officers made dozens of arrests, including two individuals for trying to impede traffic on the I-55 bridge. “Two individuals were trying to run up the entrance ramp westbound on I-55,” Buckner said. “After numerous commands, they refused to voluntarily come down. This is a main artery into the city. The medical district is right here, and we need to keep it clear. They were arrested after these two refused to comply with officers’ orders.” I am saddened by the death of George Floyd. I believe in peaceful protests. This was not that. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said riot was the “language of the unheard.” When private citizens are terrified being hurt by lawless hoards roaming aimlessly or property owners fearing financial ruin because of reckless looting and mayhem, that is not the language of which Dr. King spoke. This is something quite different. It has no place in peaceful, nonviolent protests. (Dr. Sybil C. Mitchell is senior freelancer contributor for The New Tri-State Defender.)",0.0
1622502262,2020-06-01 11:01:53,"What we know about antifa, the group Trump wants to name a terrorist organization",https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2020/05/31/trump-antifa-terrorist-group-tennessee/5300506002/,en,False,,658835,State News - United States - Tennessee,http://www.tennessee.statenews.net/,"President Donald Trump has announced he intends to designate a militant anti-racist movement a terrorist organization as violent protests attended by a variety of activists have erupted in cities around the country, including Nashville. The protests, some of which have resulted in destruction of property and violent clashes with police, are being held in response to police killing George Floyd in Minneapolis and other black individuals who have recently died at the hands of law enforcement. ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,"" Trump said during remarks at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday, though it's unclear by what legal mechanism he can designate a domestic organization to be a terrorist group. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a left-wing activist movement active globally, including in Tennessee. The loosely affiliated groups frequently advocate for anti-racist policies, though often take an anarchist and militant approach. There is no formal leadership or unified national structure to the movement. It is not one organization, but rather loose network of activists using a ""black bloc"" tactic at protests — dressing in all black and concealing their faces with masks and bandannas. Multiple antifa groups have been based in Nashville in recent years. No clear evidence antifa organized violent protests in Nashville While many of the protesters in Nashville on Saturday fit that description, it's unclear if any affiliate with antifa organizations. Metro Nashville Police Department Chief Steve Anderson said Sunday the city is investigating a small group of people they believe used the protest as a cover for violence and other criminal acts. The police chief did not say if any organized groups might be behind the violence in Nashville. A peaceful rally held downtown Saturday afternoon evolved throughout the evening, eventually turning from a march into a chaotic eruption of vandalism to public and private property. Metro Nashville's historic courthouse and city hall were set afire in the process, among other significant damage the building sustained. Antifa groups have, however, openly mobilized overwhelmingly nonviolent counterprotests at events like the October 2017 ""White Lives Matter Rally"" in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro, as well as made appearances at the annual American Renaissance conference held at Tennessee's Montgomery Bell State Park. The conference, which was canceled this year due to the coronavirus and therefore did not prompt a protest, is held by a white nationalist organization. The protest groups are typically met with a large number of park rangers and forced to demonstrate behind barriers, limiting the possibility for physical confrontations with the conference-goers. While some small altercations have taken place between protesters and counterprotesters at those events, there is no evidence that antifa activists have been responsible for inciting any type of significant violence in Tennessee. They frequently inhabit a very insular online space, trading jabs with individuals they believe to espouse white supremacist beliefs. As with other antifa activists around the nation, Jam City Antifa, a Nashville-based network, has been known to track area white supremacists and post photos and other identifying information about them online, sometimes encouraging followers to show up to heckle them at events. White supremacists have in turn done the same for antifa activists in the area. Last year, U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Knoxville, filed the ""Unmasking Antifa Act,"" legislation that sought to punish up to 15 years a person wearing a mask or disguise while committing a crime, including threatening or intimidating another individual ""exercising their constitutional rights or privileges,"" according to a statement from Burchett's office at the time. ""It’s time we get tough on this issue. These cowards wouldn’t act the way they do if the whole world could see their faces,” Burchett said at the time, which was pre-coronavirus pandemic. Trump's administration quick to cast blame on antifa amid protests U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Sunday also blamed antifa and other similar groups over the violent protests around the country. Barr did not say what specific groups may have been involved or where they came from, but he said the Justice Department and the FBI will work on identifying “criminal organizers and instigators” to be arrested and charged Trump's national security advisor Robert O'Brien told CNN Sunday that the administration planned to ""get to the bottom"" of antifa's role in the protests. And he said the president and Barr want to know what the FBI is doing to ""to track and dismantle and surveil and prosecute antifa."" O'Brien denounced ""these antifa militant radicals who come into our cities and cross state lines. ""They're organized, and use Molotov cocktails and fireworks and gas to burn down our cities, especially businesses in minority neighborhoods. It's got to be stopped,"" he said on ""State of the Union."" But some have blamed right-wing provocateurs seeking to incite a race war for the violence. ""The truth is nobody really knows,"" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Sunday on NBC News' ""Meet the Press."" ""What the exact political motivation is is unclear at this point. We need to investigate it,"" Ellison said. USA Today and Adam Tamburin contributed to this report. Reach Natalie Allison at nallison@tennessean.com. Follow her on Twitter at @natalie_allison.

1622503678,2020-06-01 06:32:46,Federal officials investigating if  extremist groups infiltrated protests,https://wreg.com/news/federal-officials-investigating-if-extremist-groups-infiltrated-protests/,en,True,,78089,wreg.com,http://www.wreg.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a “very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.” President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There’s a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it’s not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia.” Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even as he cried he couldn’t breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials.",0.0

Memphis Police said a large crowd gathered downtown after the protest. After several attempts to disperse the crowd, police say several people became irate. Dozens of officers shielded with riot gear were at a stand-off with protestors Saturday night and several people were arrested. Activists say the entire event could have been avoided. “When I showed up, I saw a sea of Memphis Police Department cars,” said Hunter Demster, an activist who witnessed first-hand Saturday night’s disturbance. “If they can’t figure out that that in itself is escalation, we need new leadership.” According to a statement by MPD, there was a large crowd in the area of Beale and Main Street after the first protest. Police said after several attempts to disperse the crowd, the crowd grew irate and began jumping on squad cars. Additional officers were called in and a barricade was made to contain the crowd. However, video shows a more detailed narrative. “Everything that I saw in their statement, that I saw first-hand, does not match what I saw,” Demster said. In the video, you see officers cover Beale Street, mounted on horses and covered in riot gear. As officers moved towards the crowd, protestors threw bottles and rocks and then used the barricades to stop officers from proceeding before running down Beale Street. Facebook video shows that, prior to the confrontation, a verbal altercation occurred between an officer and a protestor. “I said, ‘Do black lives matter to you?’ He said, ‘No, white lives matter a little more,’” a protester claimed. “I said, ‘Oh really.’ That officer then pushed me with both hands.” That protestor, Darin Abston, is among the several people who were arrested. Demster said that, despite what happened, the entire situation could have been avoided and he faults police for escalating the situation. “It was on Beale Street at midnight on a Saturday night. That was a public street. We have a right to be there,” Demster said. “There’s nothing illegal about being there. There’s nothing illegal about using your voice.” Memphis Police said they did not have a comment on the situation. Police also said several shots were fired at officers Saturday night. Demster said the people who fired those shots were not taking part in any of the protests earlier in the day.",0.0

Demonstrations took place in Downtown and Midtown Memphis as protesters gathered outside police precincts, along historic Beale Street and a number of other locations including the National Civil Rights Museum. As hundreds marched last night and into early Monday morning, some tensions did spill over into less peaceful circumstances. One group decided to loot the Marathon gas station at Poplar Avenue and Danny Thomas. Video from the scene showed some people struggling to keep the looters out of the business, but they were not successful. The glass doors at Southland Mall in Whitehaven were also smashed overnight, but it’s unclear if anyone was able to get inside. In the downtown area, Winfield’s Shoe store at North Main and Madison and a Walgreens were also damaged. People who live in the area said protestors came through around 12:30 a.m. They believe the damage was caused by smaller groups straggling behind. Two Walmarts – one on Elvis Presley and the other on Winchester – were burglarized during separate incidents overnight. JeVonte Broady, Jamal Johnson, Kendall Anderson and Xavian Lott were all arrested and charged. One group of protesters got on I-55 from E.H. Crump Boulevard and began walking down the interstate, spraying signs and at one point even crossing a fence into a neighborhood. The protestors then made their way to Riverside Drive. It was there that law enforcement used mace and tear gas when someone breached the line. The National Guard was also seen in Downtown Memphis. Police said 31 people were arrested Sunday night. Overnight, officers also responded to several shooting scenes. One was at the corner of Elvis Presley and Raines. An employee at that location said a number of shots were fired as people drove through the parking lot overnight. An officer was shot at multiple times after responding to a burglary call in the 4000 block of Elvis Presley Boulevard. His vehicle was struck several times, but he was not injured. There was another shooting at 1198 Lamar. That incident sent one person to the hospital.

What do we tell our children?,https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,106478,columbiadailyherald.com,http://columbiadailyherald.com/,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0

The incident came after acts of vandalism on the property, it was stated. Officials said, ""Once the vandals were placed in custody, several protestors attempted to climb the stairs to the balcony once again where deputies armed with less lethal beanbag weapons were positioned as they attempted to secure the area. Protestors ignored our personnel’s commands and continued to verbally assault officers and advance in a threatening posture. ""As more law enforcement personnel arrived to assist deputies, another altercation took place when protestors attempted to grab a deputy and pull him into the crowd. Deputies immediately deployed CS gas for the protection of the deputy as well as the property to disperse unruly protestors. As this was a fast evolving incident with aggressive behavior, a warning of CS gas deployment was neither warranted or an option."" Sheriff Jim Hammond said, “For the last two nights, the HCSO has partnered with local law enforcement agencies to support and defend our citizens right to peaceably assemble and exercise their 1st amendment right. As a nation, free speech and the right to peaceably assemble it is one of our most fundamental rights. However, we will not tolerate unruly protestors vandalizing any property. Physical assaults upon my deputies will not stand and we will respond to these types of threats accordingly. The death of George Floyd was tragic and those involved in the incident will be held accountable and will have to answer for their actions in a court of law. Those who wish to protest the events that occurred in Minneapolis can do peacefully and will be supported by your sheriff’s office. ""Let me be clear, assaulting any person, including our local law enforcement, vandalizing buildings, destroying private property, and burning vehicles is not honoring Mr. Floyd or his death. I implore those who wish to protest to do so in a respectful, peaceful manner. I assure you your Sheriff’s Office will support your right to protest, but not if you endanger members of our community, threaten or assault members of law enforcement, or vandalize our buildings or personal property.” Sheriff Hammond also said concerning a statement by city police that they got no warning that tear gas was being used, “Well you usually don’t warn people when you have to take action against illegal behavior and criminal activity. I won’t speak to the specifics of what the protocol is because that’s a law enforcement issue. What I can say is that we did was to stop the vandalism and criminal activity that was beginning to happen.” Sheriff Hammond said there was a good level of communication between the various departments that had to work together Sunday night. “In the day and age we live in now, it’s a lot simpler than it used to be with the cell phones and communication systems and police radio,” said the sheriff. “We did well between coordinated efforts with the agencies.” The sheriff believes the majority of protesters were participating in order to have social media material, or because they were curious. He said “I think it was a very small number who wanted to become radicalized or create vandalism and criminal behavior.” “That’s why we took the position of you have the right to protest peacefully. But you do not have the right to protest and create damage and criminal activity.” Sheriff Hammond said the department had no control over whether or not the National Guard is deployed. He said HCSO was tasked with protecting county property, which is the jail, the old courthouse, and the City/County Courts Building. “In this particular case, the governor had a real thorny issue because this was going on in multiple places in Tennessee,” said Sheriff Hammond. “So he made the decision to have the National Guard on standby, and it was Highway Patrol that requested there be some available in case things went south.” There was not a curfew last night, and that was always a possibility if things got more out of hand. But that was call from the governor or the mayor, the sheriff said. Sheriff Hammond said multiple times that he supports people’s ability to protest peacefully. “This country was founded upon the ability for people to peacefully protest, and we have no problem with that. When you start destroying property, especially historical property that cannot be replaced, that’s where I have to draw the line.” The sheriff said there is a vast collection of footage the department can look through from Sunday night, which includes drone footage. He said several arrests were or have already been made. He said that where people can be identified as having participated in vandalism, they will face prosecution.",0.0

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) NEW YORK (AP) — The music industry is planning to turn off the music and hold a day to reflect and implement change in response to the death of George Floyd and the killings of other black people. Several top record labels organized Black Out Tuesday as violent protests erupted around the world sparked by Floyd’s death as well as the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Music-based companies Live Nation and TikTok, as well as the Recording Academy, posted to social media that it planned to support and stand with the black community. “On Tuesday June 2nd, Columbia Records will observe ‘Black Out Tuesday,’” the Sony label home to Beyoncé, Bob Dylan, Adele and John Legend said in a statement. “This is not a day off. Instead, this is a day to reflect and figure out ways to move forward in solidarity.” “We continue to stand with the Black community, our staff, artists, and peers in the music industry,” the company continued. “Perhaps with the music off, we can truly listen.” Others that have joined Black Out Tuesday include the Sony imprints RCA Records and Epic Records; the Universal Music Group divisions Republic Records, Def Jam, UMG Nashville, Capitol Records and Island Records; and the Warner Music Group imprints Atlantic and Warner Records. Smaller, independent labels as well as music publishing companies and management firms have also signed on. UMG’s Interscope Geffen A&M said that in addition to joining Black Out Tuesday, the label home to Lady Gaga and Kendrick Lamar would not release music this week — the first label to do so. “Instead, IGA will contribute to organizations that help to bail out protesters exercising their right to peacefully assemble, aid lawyers working for systemic change and provide assistance to charities focused on creating economic empowerment in the Black community,” its statement read. IGA postponed new music releases MGK, 6lack, Dylan, Jessie Ware, Smokepurp, Lil Mosey, Billy Raffoul, Max Leone and more in coordination with their partners Alamo, LVRN, The Darkroom, Bad Boy and more. Musicians including Rihanna, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Lil Nas X, Demi Lovato, Post Malone and Harry Styles have spoken out following Floyd’s death and worldwide protests. Jay-Z released a statement late Sunday calling for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to prosecute those responsible for killing Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck. “I, along with an entire country in pain, call upon AG Ellison to do the right thing and prosecute all those responsible for the murder of George Floyd to the fullest extent of the law. This is just a first step. I am more determined to fight for justice than any fight my would-be oppressors may have,” Jay-Z said. “I prevail on every politician, prosecutor and officer in the country to have the courage to do what is right. Have the courage to look at us as humans, dads, brothers, sisters and mothers in pain and look at yourselves.” Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Taylor to death in her home in March. The R&B duo Chloe x Halle, who will release their sophomore album “Ungodly Hour” on Friday, posted a cover of the classic civil rights anthem and protest song “We Shall Overcome” to Instagram. “This week has been very heavy for all of us. We’ve been trying to, not understand, because there’s no way to understand the terrible killings — we just have heavy hearts this week and are just trying to do everything we can to pray and lift each other up with our voices,” Halle said in an interview with The Associated Press. “With everything going on, we felt like music can be very healing, because it’s been that way for us in kind of keeping us sane during this time,” Chloe added. As much as we could, we just wanted to share our gift of song to even just lift spirits for even a few seconds.”",0.0

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote.

More than 4,400 arrests have been made at protests nationwide since viral video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day, resulting in Floyd's death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the incident was the right thing to do. Peaceful protests continued to be marred by violence. The Minneapolis Department of Public safety confirmed a semi-truck drove into a group of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35. The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries.

""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. Illinois governor calls on National Guard to assist Chicago police Vandalism and fires were reported in several Chicago neighborhoods and some suburbs Sunday night after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot severely restricted access to downtown following nights of violent protests. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. ""This has been a scary and unsettling time, but I know we will get through this and begin the process of healing together,"" Lightfoot said in a midnight Twitter post. ""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Protesters vandalize, set fire to police SUVs in New Jersey A group of people was captured on video destroying police SUVs in Trenton, New Jersey. In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.”",0.0

Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0
1622566583,2020-06-01 10:51:55,What is antifa and what does the movement want?,https://www.oakridger.com/zz/news/20200601/what-is-antifa-and-what-does-movement-want?rssfeed=true,en,False,,152402,oakridger.com,http://oakridger.com/,"Antifa — short for ""anti-fascist"" — is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

What do we tell our children?,https://www.oakridger.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,152402,oakridger.com,http://oakridger.com/,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

1622566565,2020-06-01 12:32:51,Minneapolis is trying to recover after days of George Floyd protests – one bag of garbage and one food donation at a time,https://www.oakridger.com/zz/news/20200601/minneapolis-is-trying-to-recover-after-days-of-george-floyd-protests---one-bag-of-garbage-and-one-food-donation-at-time?rssfeed=true,en,False,,152402,oakridger.com,http://oakridger.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS — At the end of a week that roiled this city of 400,000, there were people carrying brooms and garbage bags on a sunny Sunday. Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help.

1622569519,2020-06-01 14:24:14,City leaders implement curfew for Memphis,https://wreg.com/news/watch-strickland-rallings-to-hold-news-conference/,en,False,,78089,wreg.com,http://www.wreg.com/#spider,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Mayor Jim Strickland announced the city of Memphis will implementing a 10 p.m. curfew beginning Monday night. The announcement follows a peaceful protest Sunday night that later turned into a standoff with law enforcement downtown, and some acts of vandalism in the city. The curfew will be from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. If you are out, you could be arrested. There is an exception for essential workers and people with medical emergencies. “We can’t let the second group steal the message to end systematic racism and take hope from those of us who love our city and want to bring meaningful and lasting change to a broken system,” Mayor Strickland said. The curfew will last “as long as necessary,” Strickland said. Read details on the curfew in mayor Strickland’s executive order Some businesses Monday announced they were adjusting their hours in light of the curfew, among them Huey’s, Aldo’s and Summer Drive-In. In all 31 people were arrested overnight in Memphis. Police said 44 people had been arrested since Wednesday in connection with protest events. Police said 10 businesses had been vandalized, three police cars damaged, and shots were fired at three officers since Wednesday. Mayor Strickland thanked the peaceful protesters who have marched in Memphis for several nights, saying he supported them and he knows there is more work to be done. But, he said, there is another group who wanted to bring destruction and chaos. “Last night we saw things take a turn for the worst,” Strickland said, noting businesses vandalized, and shots fired at officers. He said if people don’t like the way policing is done, the force is hiring right now. Join the force, be the change, he said. He urged families to reach out to loved ones who are involved in the looting and assaults on police officers to have them comply with the curfew and stop that activity. Memphis Police Director Michael Rallings says he wants to make sure the protesters can continue to be a model for the country. “I remember some of the protesters earlier say that we want to be a model for the U.S.,” Director Rallings said. “We want to be a model for the world. Let’s continue on that path. Let’s not model negative behavior.” Director Rallings said the Tennessee National Guard is already operating in Memphis. He released the following statement on Facebook on Monday: “During a demonstration or protest, MPD’s lawful obligation is to provide public safety for every citizen. MPD will deny the unlawful destruction, looting, and damage to all property. MPD will not allow any disruptions in business, school, government, and everyday function of life and liberty by unruly protesters or unlawful protest. Last night, as the night before, a peaceful protest took place in the downtown area. However, this peaceful protest appears to have accelerated as the night progressed. Some of the protesters who were initially walking were peaceful, but many who participated chose to branch off from the peaceful protest and began wreaking havoc in our city. “What started as a peaceful protest accelerated quickly into a form of riot behavior. Participants refused to disperse from blocking roadways, they threw rocks and bottles at officers, attempted to shut down our interstate system, and they vandalized and looted businesses,” said Director Rallings. “I am extremely proud and thankful for the professionalism shown by our officers, the Shelby County Sheriff’s deputies, THP, and the National Guard. We will continue to work together throughout this process, and we will maintain order.” Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris knows about negative encounters with police first hand and is working to change the system through policies that reduce interacting between black people and police. Wednesday, he will introduce an ordinance to allow those with criminal histories to be eligible for jobs. “I’ll bring that criminal justice reform to the county commission Wednesday,” Mayor Harris said. “I’ll continue to bring criminal justice reform to the county commission because that’s one of the ways we can reduce interactions with law enforcement and actually do something about the issue.” Director Rallings also said one of the best ways to stop the kind of policing that we saw in Minneapolis is to become the change. He reiterated the Memphis Police Department has a huge hiring campaign happening now.",0.0
1622570632,2020-06-01 13:52:15,Unrest could influence Biden's search for election running mate,https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/news/20200601/unrest-could-influence-biden8217s-search-for-election-running-mate?rssfeed=true,en,False,"politics and government, united states politics and government, elections, blacks, mayors",106478,columbiadailyherald.com,http://columbiadailyherald.com/,"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden’s search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd’s death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden’s choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a “transition” candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd’s death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. “The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it’s important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who’s been asked for input by Biden’s team on the selection process. Bottoms is one of several black women under consideration by Biden’s campaign. Others Biden is believed to be considering include California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. Demings didn’t answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman in an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday. “Well, we’ve never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate. But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward,” Asked if she believes race should be left out of the conversation, she was careful to defer to Biden. “It doesn’t really matter what I think,” she said. “What matters is what Americans think, and what Joe Biden thinks.” Demings, a former Orlando police chief, wrote a high-profile editorial on Friday challenging her former colleagues in law enforcement. “As a former woman in blue, let me begin with my brothers and sisters in blue: What in the hell are you doing?” Demings wrote in The Washington Post. Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. In an interview Sunday, Demings defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring “you’re either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution.” “And I think the community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,” she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. “Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,” he said. “I’ve got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn’t want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same.” Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota’s largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd’s murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. “This is very tough timing for her,” said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she’s not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Those twin crises have already led to increased scrutiny for others in the mix to become Biden’s running mate. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a frequent Trump target during the pandemic for her resistance to lifting stay at home orders, faced questions after her husband allegedly tried to skip the line with a dock company and get his boat in the water ahead of other patrons over Memorial Day weekend. And Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico was criticized by Republicans in her state following a report that she purchased jewelry from a local business just days after she ordered non-essential businesses to shut down and told residents to stay home. Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who was vetted as a potential vice presidential pick in 2004, said the scrutiny contenders are facing now has “proliferated.” “The scrutiny compared to when I was vetted is so much more intense and potentially troublesome for a VP candidate,” he said. Biden’s search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. “It’s important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don’t mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,” said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair.",0.0

Protests have erupted in dozens of cities over the past week since Floyd, a black man, died after a police officer was seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck for minutes on end. ""I think the public is getting to a place that it's never been before in understanding a lot of this,"" Biden said at the event. ""But it's going to take a whole hell of a lot of hard work. A lot of hard work. But I'm confident it can be done."" Fourteen faith leaders and local lawmakers attended the event at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Del., donning masks and seated two to a pew to help maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus. Biden spent more than half of the event listening to the concerns of community leaders rather than delivering remarks. He could be seen taking notes as each attendee got up and spoke. Despite being in a room full of supporters, the group offered critical feedback to the former vice president, with some saying the black community didn't get the economic boost it needed under the Obama administration and that Biden's role in passing the 1994 crime bill makes some young black voters skeptical of him. There were recommendations to create a czar dedicated solely to the study of police brutality within Biden's first 100 days as president. Several speakers urged Biden to pick an African American woman as his vice president. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., spoke emotionally of a recent exchange she had with a 23-year-old protester in Wilmington who told her he was ""willing to die."" ""He said, 'I have so much rage.' And I said, 'How old are you? What's your name? How old are you?' And I just tried to hold him. COVID or not,"" the congresswoman said. After about an hour, Biden himself rose to address the church gathering. ""I want to make something clear: I don't expect anything from the black community,"" he said. ""It has to be earned, earned every single time."" Biden said he's spent time speaking with black thought leaders about how to move forward as a country and said people who ""don't think of themselves as having a prejudiced bone in their body"" are now reckoning with the discrimination endemic in some American institutions. ""The band-aid's been ripped off by this pandemic and this president. No one can pretend any longer what this is all about. Nobody can pretend who has been carrying us on our backs — it's the minorities,"" Biden said. Biden listed specific plans for his would-be administration, including heightened federal oversight over local law enforcement, additional training for police officers and increased economic opportunity for African Americans. He teased the announcement of a new economic proposal in the coming weeks, which he said will have a strong emphasis on housing, education and access to capital. ""The ultimate answer for every other group has been access to economic opportunity,"" Biden said. ""What is the future? The future is you gotta be able to get out of bed and think, 'I can make it, I can do something. The deck's not completely stacked.'"" He also stressed what he characterized a critical need to change leadership in the Senate, particularly as it relates to confirming federal judges. ""If we don't win back the United States Senate, we're going to be in real trouble,"" Biden said. ""Presidents come and go. But I tell you what, justices don't. They last a long time."" The event ended with a prayer and Biden saying he'll rely on the group for advice throughout his campaign. ""I know I'm going to make mistakes,"" he said before quoting the expression, ""What comes from the heart goes straight to the heart."" ""It's going to come from the heart. But I'll need help,"" the former vice president said. ""I need help and advice as we go along as to what you think I should and shouldn't be doing."" This marked Biden's third public appearance in a week, his first trips away from his home since mid-March. He has been campaigning from his house due to coronavirus lockdown orders. Biden left his home on Memorial Day to lay a wreath at a veterans park near his home, and on Sunday he visited a site in Wilmington where protesters had gathered the night before in response to Floyd's death. Biden held a virtual meeting with mayors later in the day and had virtual fundraisers planned for Monday evening. ",0.0

After six straight days of unrest, a new routine was developing: residents waking up to neighborhoods in shambles, shopkeepers taking stock of ransacked stores, and police and political leaders weighing how to address the boiling anger. While many of the demonstrations around the country have been peaceful protests by racially diverse crowds, others have descended into violence, despite curfews in big cities across the U.S. and the deployment of thousands of National Guard soldiers over the past week. On Sunday, protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin, Texas, and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them first, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis. In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry, leaving shop owners, many of them just beginning to reopen their businesses after the coronavirus shutdowns, to clean up their shattered stores. In other places, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators. The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes. Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Breonna Taylor to death in her home in March. The upheaval has unfolded amid the gloom and economic ruin caused by the coronavirus, which has killed over 100,000 Americans and sent unemployment soaring to levels not seen since the Depression. The outbreak has hit minorities especially hard, not just in infections and deaths but in job losses and economic stress. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests has rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count compiled by The Associated Press. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name!” At the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, police fired tear gas and stun grenades Sunday into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a street nearby. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the flames. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office was burned down. The district’s entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to Pentagon officials. As the unrest grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton, who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, talked to demonstrators and wrote a post online expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. On Monday, Biden met with community leaders at a predominantly African American church. “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” said Sylvester Beaman, pastor of the Bethel AME church in Wilmington. In New York, thieves raided luxury stores, including Chanel, Rolex and Prada boutiques. In Birmingham, Alabama, a Confederate statute was toppled. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Thousands marched peacefully in Phoenix; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying the destruction weakens calls for justice and reform. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said t wo officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday and using stun guns on the man and woman inside. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. Scores of people swarmed into stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags. In Minneapolis, the officer who pinned Floyd to the pavement has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest, but thousands marching on a closed freeway were shaken when a tractor-trailer rolled into their midst. No serious injuries were reported. The driver was arrested on suspicion of assault. In tweets Sunday, Trump accused anarchists and the media of fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems.",0.0

Story Highlights Corey Strong is an educator, Commander in Navy Reserves, and candidate for Congress in TN-09 The COVID-19 crisis is one of greatest crises humanity has ever faced, changing life as we know it. A lack of federal and state leadership made the crisis worse while costing us precious time, resources, and lives. Locally, the story was a bit different as Mayor Strickland demonstrated sound and independent leadership from the beginning. His administration continues to communicate well with the public about COVID-19 and he bases his decisions on data and science from the experts. Mayor Strickland, you have done a fine job during a very difficult time. But your comments after last Wednesday's protest showed that there is still room for growth when leading in a crisis. I’ll use a sea story to illustrate my point. Earlier in my military career, I was a division officer on board a U.S. navy vessel. The evening before our ship’s change of command, one of my junior sailors committed suicide. The change of command is one of the biggest ceremonies that a military unit experiences. There were a number of things that needed to be done to execute that event in good order. But, the minute that traumatic incident occurred, the mission changed and the well-being of our sailors became my first priority. I delivered the news to my sailors about the brother we lost and made sure they could trust and depend on their leadership during that trying time. If I hadn’t gained their trust immediately, the ceremony, our upcoming deployment, and any other mission would have been lost. Memphians are hungry for leadership The protest Wednesday was an opportunity to demonstrate trusted leadership, recognize the pain of the community and listen to their concerns. Yet, you choose to scold them, gloss over the brutal murder of George Floyd and shift the focus to COVID-19 and officer safety. While those things are important, the trauma caused by Mr. Floyd’s death was your first priority. Your admonishment of the protestors was insensitive, tone deaf, and showed a lack of understanding of the deep and unhealed wounds regarding crimes perpetrated against Black people by the police. Ultimately, it was a rebuke of the community you were elected to represent. Mr. Floyd may not have been a Memphian, but he is a member of the Black community. We feel a deep, agonizing pain and collective trauma for not only his death, but for Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and the countless others who have lost their lives and not received justice. Hear more Tennessee Voices: Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought provoking columns. Serving as mayor in a city with a 64% Black population, the community expects more from your leadership. Winning an election does not absolve you, or any of our elected officials, of your responsibility to the community. One crisis does not make another crisis any less important, especially when it’s the crisis of racism, profiling, targeting and brutality. We need to hear from you, know that you understand our collective hurt and that you are committed to healing the trauma with us. That should have been priority number one. Unfortunately, the death of Floyd may not be the last death of an unarmed black person. Going forward, we need you to be the strong, independent leader you have shown you are capable of being. First, make a statement when an incident like this occurs, as opposed to after a protest. There is doubt and lack of trust when there is silence. Next, focus on the well-being of Memphians. Lastly, when a situation makes you feel vulnerable, exposed, and you want to retreat back to where you are comfortable, recognize the awesome responsibility and opportunity you have to lead and support a community that experiences those feelings every day.

Officers said they responded to the County Courthouse around 10:30 p.m. when they were advised ""a protest was turning destructive."" Police said drone footage showed some lights being destroyed at the courthouse, which dates to 1913 and was designed by famed architect R.H. Hunt. More law enforcement officers responded to the scene. Police said the crowd began pushing toward the entry doors to the courthouse. Police said, ""The protest was evolving into a riot as property was being destroyed and it appeared that several people were about to make entry to the courthouse. Police could already hear chants of destruction and burning. Police told the crowd to back away from the doors. The report says, ""After several failed warnings, police began to push the crowd back from the entry of the courthouse. Police said Thomas Luke Sylvester, 34, of 312 Lindsay St., refused to move back. He was eventually taken to the ground and handcuffed. He was charged with rioting and criminal trespass. Officers said Gary Lockwood, 27, was among those involved in vandalizing the light fixtures on the courthouse steps. When two deputies tried to take him into custody he kicked both in the face, breaking their glasses. Police said Lockwood would not put his hands behind his back and was screaming at the crowd to incite them more. Lockwood said he is homeless and is a native of Michigan. He was charged with reckless endangerment, aggravated assault, aggravated assault on police, inciting to riot, vandalism and resisting arrest. At a protest at 928 Market St., police said Luis R. Padilla Pascual, 20, of 314 McBrien Road, tried to throw a rock at an officer. When officers began to detain him they said he began to yell and ""cause a huge scene."" Police said it brought a crowd to the site. He was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. Also, police said Christopher L. Graham, of 190 Lillie Dr., Chickamauga, Ga., Alex McCain Barbee, 20, of 972 Brotherton Lane, Chickamauga, Ga., and Riley McKenzie Cash, 20, of 123A Kelley Lane, Flintstone, Ga., were arrested after an incident at 150 River St. Police said they and the National Guard ""responded to a riot at Coolidge Park."" They said an effort was made to get protestors off of the roadways and into the park. However, they said Graham, Barbee and Cash refused to leave the Market Street Bridge. Warren Tefft, 26, of 4715 Bonny Oaks Dr., was arrested after police said he was being disorderly and unruly in the 300 block of Market St. Police said he refused to move out of the roadway, but continuing sitting on a bicycle. Police said John William Davis, 27, of 2309 Union Ave., was at the 300 block of Market Street. Police said he became unruly, jerked away from officers, and tried to run off.",0.0

(AP) — Facebook employees are using Twitter to register their frustration over CEO Mark Zuckerberg's decision to leave up posts by President Donald Trump that suggested protesters in Minneapolis could be shot. While Twitter demoted and placed a warning on a tweet about the protests that read, in part, that ""when the looting starts the shooting starts,"" Facebook has let it stand, with Zuckerberg laying out his reasoning in a Facebook post Friday. ""I know many people are upset that we've left the President's posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,"" Zuckerberg wrote. Trump's comment evoked the civil-rights era by borrowing a phrase used in 1967 by Miami's police chief to warn of an aggressive police response to unrest in black neighborhoods. On Monday, Facebook employees staged a virtual ""walkout"" to protest the company's decision not to touch the Trump posts according to a report in the New York Times, which cited anonymous senior employees at Facebook. The Times report says ""dozens"" of Facebook workers ""took the day off by logging into Facebook's systems and requesting time off to support protesters across the country."" ""I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we're showing up. The majority of coworkers I've spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard,"" tweeted Jason Toff, a director of product management at Facebook who's been at the company for a year. Toff, who has a verified Twitter account, had 131,400 ""likes"" and thousands of retweets of his comment. He did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Monday. ""I don't know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable. I'm a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark's decision to do nothing about Trump's recent posts, which clearly incite violence. I'm not alone inside of FB. There isn't a neutral position on racism,"" tweeted another employee, design manager Jason Stirman. Stirman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Sara Zhang, a product designer at the company, tweeted that Facebook's ""decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe. The policy pigeon holes us into addressing harmful user-facing content in two ways: keep content up or take it down."" ""I believe that this is a self-imposed constraint and implore leadership to revisit the solution,"" she continued. Zhang declined to comment to The Associated Press. Representatives for Facebook did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment Monday. Late Sunday, Zuckerberg again posted on Facebook, pledging a $10 million donation to racial justice groups. But he made no mention of Trump's posts. Instead, he highlighted Facebook's role in the spreading of the video of George Floyd's death. Floyd, a black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died after a white police officer ignored bystander shouts to get off him and Floyd's cries that he couldn't breathe. His death, captured on citizen video, sparked days of protests in Minneapolis that have spread to cities around America. ""We need to know George Floyd's name. But it's clear Facebook also has more work to do to keep people safe and ensure our systems don't amplify bias,"" Zuckerberg wrote. Twitter has historically taken stronger stances than its larger rival, including a complete ban on political advertisements that the company announced last November. That's partly because Facebook, a much larger company with a broader audience,targeted by regulators over its size and power, has more to lose. And partly because the companies' CEOs don't always see eye to eye on their role in society. Over the weekend, Twitter changed the background and logo if its main Twitter account to black from its usual blue in support of the Black Lives Matter protesters and added a #blacklivesmatter hashtag. Facebook did the same with its own logo on its site, though without the hashtag.",0.0

The S&P 500 climbed 0.4% after wavering between small gains and losses in the early going. Banks, companies that depend on consumer spending and communications companies accounted for a big slice of the gains. Health care was the only sector to fall. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of optimism among traders. Oil prices fell. Investors are balancing cautious optimism about the reopening of businesses shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic against worries that the civil unrest across the U.S. over police brutality and racism could disrupt the economic recovery and widen the outbreak. The daily protests, which began last week in Minneapolis and have since turned violent in multiple cities, are not weighing on the stock market, at least so far. ""The market has been expecting a springtime for economic activity,"" said Mike Zigmont, head of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management. ""If these events derail the animal spirits that the markets have been counting on across the country, then I think they will have an impact. But investors are dismissing it as a short-term, non-event."" The S&P 500 rose 11.42 points to 3,055.73. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 91.91 points, or 0.4%, to 25,475.02. The Nasdaq composite climbed 62.18 points, or 0.7%, to 9,552.05. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains. The Russell 2000 index picked up 11.34 points, or 0.8%, to 1,405.37. The stock market is coming off its second month of solid gains. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. The Federal Reserve and Congress have pledged unprecedented amounts of aid for the economy. That helped spur the market's move higher from its March lows. Now investors are betting that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. ""I think we are through the worst of it for sure, and the markets reflect that in the bounce we've seen,"" said David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs. This week will provide market watchers more insight on the impact that the coronavirus is having on U.S. workers and employers. Payroll processor ADP issues its May survey of hiring by private U.S. companies Wednesday. The next day, the government releases its weekly tally of applications for unemployment aid.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.66% from 0.64% late Friday. Oil prices ended lower. Benchmark U.S. crude oil for July delivery fell 5 cents to settle at $35.44 a barrel Monday.

Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, rallied with protesters in Providence this past weekend. “My heart is broken,” Cicilline said. “People are sick and tired of this and they’re looking for the leaders in government to provide not only some comfort, some acknowledgment that their pain is real but some commitment to do something about it.” Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, said the violence and destruction of property in some parts of the nation aren’t reflective of the majority of the protesters. “The vast majority of protestors have been non-violent and filled with righteous anger and indignation,” Raskin said. Raskin said Congress can take action on the issue of black men dying at the hands of police. “What we’re going to have to do is tie federal money to adopting the best practices to get rid of racists cops and to adhere to the highest levels of performance,” Raskin said. With demonstrations on-going, during a conference call Monday, President Donald Trump told governors they are “weak” for not “dominating” the streets. From the Kennedy Space Center this weekend, Trump said the memory of Floyd is being dishonored by rioters and looters. “We can’t and must not allow a small group of criminals and vandals to wreck our cities and lay waste to our communities,” Trump said. “My administration will stop mob violence and we’ll stop it cold.” Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C. and Miami to help stop the violence.",0.0

Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place. The merits of the protesters' cause ""doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. At least one protester in Tampa, Florida, is known to have COVID-19. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who expressed dismay last week about Floyd's death, tweeted Monday that five of his officers were exposed to the protester, whom he did not identify. Protesting – especially without a mask – can put people at higher risk for infection, said Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" he said during a Monday media availability. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Viral photos: A photo page of striking moments from the week’s protests. As businesses re-open, it will be difficult to figure out whether someone caught the virus at a protest or in some other encounter, Mina said. Hopefully, the fact that protests are taking place out of doors, will dilute the virus and reduce disease transmission, he said. Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit."" There is historical precedent to suggest that viruses can be spread by large public gatherings. In September 1918, people in Philadelphia held a parade to celebrate the return of soldiers from World War I. The gathering of 200,000 people, crammed shoulder to shoulder, reignited a deadly flu epidemic, leading to massive closures and thousands of deaths, records show. Yet, there's a public health cost to not protesting the status quo, said Dr. Hillary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and immediate past president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. ""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said. She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said. ""It's a little disingenuous to say that the health risk from protesting is somehow bigger than the health risk at Lake of Ozarks (where people gathered for fun over Memorial Day weekend) or the practices that brought us to this point in the first place."" At least one reveler at the lake party tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Camden County Health Department. Others were advised to monitor for symptoms. Babcock said it is possible to minimize the risks of protesting, with masks, social distancing and asking sick people to stay home. Arresting people and putting them into close contact with others increases risk, Babcock said, as does spraying protesters with pepper spray, which causes violent coughing and can potentially spread the virus. Timeline: George Floyd protests: How did we get here? Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency room physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, said there is risk of longer-term effects in communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Wen was Baltimore's health commissioner when protests erupted following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. The death triggered civil unrest in communities already burdened with deep-seated inequities, she said. ""When over a dozen pharmacies burned down and closed and stores were looted, it was community members themselves who were affected the most,"" Wen said. While protests over the past week following Floyd's death have highlighted police-community relations, demonstrators are also calling attention to social justice issues, including health disparities. ""The same communities that are already the most affected are potentially going to have an increase in the number of cases as a result of people gathering,"" Wen said. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets, even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Meanwhile, state and local public health agencies plan to monitor for new COVID-19 cases. Any large gathering during a pandemic is a concern, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the Massachusetts Covid Response project. Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, handles Massachusetts’ contact tracing of individuals infected with or exposed to the virus. Following such a large gathering, potential cases need to be monitored over two weeks, the virus’s incubation period. “The epidemic curve should guide the response and the phased reopening of society,"" Welch said. ""Until the epidemic is declared over, social distancing and wearing masks should remain the new normal."" Peter Pitts, president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a nonpartisan research and educational organization, said he worries COVID-19 will take advantage of people gathering to protest police violence. ""Social distancing and social conflict are a very potent negative combination when it comes to spreading a virus,"" he said. ""The timing is highly unfortunate."" Public health concerns, which are usually complicated, can easily be drowned out by other ""sexier"" stories, he said, citing the recent SpaceX launch. But the virus ""doesn't cease to be a real threat because of other threats happening simultaneously,"" he said. ""That means we have to twice as smart and twice as dedicated and twice as focused.""

The protest was in response to the arrest of 19-year-old Christian Fouché on Sunday night. Fouché, an MTSU student originally from Memphis, was arrested for violating the 6:30 p.m. curfew law that was announced at 6:45 p.m. Attempting to leave the scene at Vine and Church St. as deputies pushed their way into the crowd, a deputy's horse stepped on Fouché's foot. As he attempted to get up, deputies rushed towards him and he was arrested on the spot. He was one of at least two people arrested Sunday night and the last to be bailed out Monday afternoon. ""I really wasn't there to protest or anything,"" Fouché said. ""I was there to see what was going to be in future history books. As I'm trying to take a picture, a deputy on a horse just came up fast as hell to me and it pushed me over. ""It stepped on my foot, and I just started screaming and couldn't believe that it had actually happened. While I'm screaming, I get tackled by the police, and I still don't understand how that was beneficial to anyone involved."" RCSO spokeswoman Lisa Marchesoni said Fouché had an outstanding bond violation for failure to appear in court and his arrest following Sunday's vigil led to him being detained. Fouché said that he wasn't told what his charges were until around 3 a.m. Monday. Deputies told him he was charged with failure to abide by the curfew. Fouché said he was unaware of the curfew until it was announced just minutes prior to the officers pushing forward. Buy Photo Christian Fouche gestures with the crowd Monday, June 1, 2020, before a march related to his arrest after Sunday's vigil in memory of George Floyd in downtown Murfreesboro. Fouche was released Monday. (Photo: HELEN COMER / DNJ) After seeing his arrest, several of Fouché's friends stayed up all night to figure out how they would get him out of jail. They got in touch with Lamont Lockridge, an MTSU senior and president of the Black Student Union at MTSU, and came up with the idea for the protest. Lockridge also got in touch with BréYhana Johnson, who is a close friend of Fouché and currently lives in Washington, D.C. but happened to be in Memphis visiting family. Johnson drove from Memphis to Murfreesboro on Monday morning to see that Fouché was released and to help take charge of the protest that had been scheduled. ""It's important to have so many here supporting him,"" Johnson said at the protest. ""We have to show up for our community and for each other. If this were me, I'd want the same to be done. ""If we don't show up for our community, we can't expect anyone else to do it. We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for our ancestors showing up for each other so we have to show up for each other."" Protesters were met in the parking lot at Lowe's by several members of the Murfreesboro Police Department. Officers and protesters had multiple conversations about a strategy to get the protesters safely to the Sheriff's office to get Fouché. However, the plans fell through multiple times as MPD officers continually stated different reasons the protest could not head that way and had to stay in the Lowe's parking lot. Tensions began to build before it was announced that Fouché had been released and that officers were bringing him to the parking lot. He arrived shortly after 2 p.m.and was greeted by hugs and handshakes from nearly everyone in attendance. After his arrival, officers and protesters began discussions on another way to lead the protesters to the Sheriff's office and finally came to an agreement. Fouché and the protesters arrived at the Rutherford County Sheriff's office without incident, and the group quickly marched up to officers to voice how they were feeling. The protesters continually shouted and told the officers why they were angry and that they wanted change. Things escalated at times, including once where a man stepped over a line of tape that protesters were not supposed to cross. Officers began to move forward, but the man was quickly brought back behind the line. Deputies started to come forward and began conversations with many protesters. Despite this, some protesters became frustrated with what was going on as they didn't believe the words the deputies were saying and decided to continue the march elsewhere. For those who stayed, long conversations between protesters and deputies happened until the last protester left after 4 p.m. ""What's important is the dialogue,"" Lockridge said. ""If we have people who get angry because there's no violence or no major uprising moment like you see in movies, we're fine with that. You can go home because you're not here for the same cause as we are. ""We're here for the dialogue and to make them understand that these people have lives and we're afraid for our lives. As long as people are coming and talking with us about change, that's what we want. I feel like today overall, especially here at the end, was a success.""

The death triggered civil unrest in communities already burdened with deep-seated inequities, she said. ""When over a dozen pharmacies burned down and closed and stores were looted, it was community members themselves who were affected the most,"" Wen said. While protests over the past week following Floyd's death have highlighted police-community relations, demonstrators are also calling attention to social justice issues, including health disparities. ""The same communities that are already the most affected are potentially going to have an increase in the number of cases as a result of people gathering,"" Wen said. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets, even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Meanwhile, state and local public health agencies plan to monitor for new COVID-19 cases. Any large gathering during a pandemic is a concern, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the Massachusetts Covid Response project. Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, handles Massachusetts’ contact tracing of individuals infected with or exposed to the virus. Following such a large gathering, potential cases need to be monitored over two weeks, the virus’s incubation period. “The epidemic curve should guide the response and the phased reopening of society,"" Welch said. ""Until the epidemic is declared over, social distancing and wearing masks should remain the new normal."" Peter Pitts, president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a nonpartisan research and educational organization, said he worries COVID-19 will take advantage of people gathering to protest police violence. ""Social distancing and social conflict are a very potent negative combination when it comes to spreading a virus,"" he said. ""The timing is highly unfortunate."" Public health concerns, which are usually complicated, can easily be drowned out by other ""sexier"" stories, he said, citing the recent SpaceX launch. But the virus ""doesn't cease to be a real threat because of other threats happening simultaneously,"" he said. ""That means we have to twice as smart and twice as dedicated and twice as focused.""

Fischer also said that Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad, who had already announced his resignation in May, has been fired; officials extended a nightly 9 p.m. curfew in the city to June 8. The announcements came hours after Gov. Andy Beshear has Kentucky State Police to investigate the early Monday incident that featured Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shooting the owner of a popular West End barbecue business at 26th Street and Broadway. The victim was David McAtee, the popular owner of a barbecue business next to the Dino's Food Mart parking lot where the shooting occurred around 12:15 a.m. Monday, McAtee's nephew told The Courier Journal. Louisville police and National Guard troops were breaking up a ""large crowd"" that had gathered in the parking lot outside Dino's Food Mart in the Russell neighborhood when someone shot at them, Conrad said Monday morning.

""Both LMPD and National Guard members returned fire."" Conrad said it is unclear if the person who was shot was the person who also fired at the officers. LOUISVILLE: From tense to touching moments, here's how Louisville's protests went down Sunday night At a Monday morning news conference in Frankfort, Beshear said he had contacted Fischer and asked LMPD to release the ""significant"" amount of body camera footage from the incident ""as soon as possible."" The governor added that he wants any video footage to be released Monday ""before nightfall."" ""I think it's really important for the truth to get out there,"" Beshear said. ""But I think it's also really important in ensuring that we don't have violence if people can see (and) know that, bad or ugly, we're being absolutely transparent about it."" ""I don't want people to have to wait several days,"" Beshear added. ""I think it's very important to communicate with the public, especially with the tensions right now."" Conrad said that police had ""several persons of interest"" who were being interviewed following the shooting. ""We are collecting video from the incident and expect to release what we have sometime (Monday),"" Conrad added. The shooting came after a curfew had once again taken effect at 9 p.m. Sunday as protests and unrest over the death of Breonna Taylor continued for the fourth straight night. Greg Fischer first implemented the 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. curfew Saturday and said it would be reevaluated Monday morning. About 350 Kentucky National Guard personnel were also first called in Saturday night to help with ""maintaining peace and protect critical infrastructure,"" as Fischer had said.

There have been 136 reported deaths from COVID-19 complications, two more than yesterday. Tennessee numbers: Here's the latest COVID-19 maps, charts and numbers for the state County health department reports 101 new cases The Shelby Count Health Department reported 101 new reported cases of COVID-19 Wednesday morning, and three new fatalities associated with the virus. The total of reported COVID-19 cases in Shelby County is 6,220 The total number of those who have recovered from COVID-19 rose by 123 since yesterday, leaving 1,982 active cases within Shelby County. So far, 136 have died from COVID-19 complications in Shelby County. During Tuesday's COVID-19 joint task force briefing, county health department director Alisa Haushalter said a substantial portion of fatalities from COVID-19 complications are occurring among residents of long-term care facilities. Haushalter reminds county of CDC advice: Protesters should get tested During the COVID-19 joint task force briefing on Tuesday, Shelby County Health Department director Alisa Haushalter reiterated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control regarding protesting in a pandemic. ""If someone has been a part of the local protests, the CDC is recommending individuals do get testing, somewhere around days five to seven,"" Haushalter said. Though protests in Memphis have generally featured crowds whose members are masked up, transmission possibilities cannot be ruled out. According to the CDC, singing is known as a ""superspreader event"", and COVID-19 outbreaks have been traced back to events like choir practice. In protests led by pastor Devante Hill, crowds of hundreds have been encouraged to gather under an overpass on Front Street at Butler Avenue, and sing together. Watch COVID-19 task force update Posted by City of Memphis on Tuesday, June 9, 2020 192 new cases of COVID-19 in Shelby County The county health department reported 192 new cases of COVID-19 and six new fatalities from complications associated with the virus. The health department reported 2,916 COVID-19 tests since yesterday. The new case total pushes the total number of reported COVID-19 cases in the county past 6,000, for a total of 6,119 cases. Of the 6,119 cases — 4,115 have recovered, leaving 2,004 active cases within the county. There have been 133 fatal cases of COVID-19 in Shelby County. SCSO testing update, one employee tests positive The Shelby County Sheriff's Office reported one additional department employee who has tested positive for COVID-19 since last week, bring the total of SCSO employees who have tested positive to 70. Of those 70 employees, 50 have recovered and one is hospitalized, SCSO said. SCSO also said that all 160 detainees who tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered. SCSO has 70 employees who have tested positive for the Coronavirus. This is an increase of one new employee who tested positive since last week’s reported. One employee is hospitalized and 50 others have recovered.  All 160 detainees who tested positive have recovered. pic.twitter.com/UWYMMXKuTw — ShelbyTNSheriff (@ShelbyTNSheriff) June 5, 2020 County reports 87 new cases, 2 deaths Shelby County reported 87 new novel coronavirus cases and two new deaths Friday. The count of reported novel coronavirus cases rose to 5,631 on Friday, up from 5,544 cases Thursday, according to the Shelby County Health Department. The number of reported deaths in the county from COVID-19 complications also rose to 122. Of the current case count, 68.4% have recovered and 2.2% have died. Hospitalizations have leveled off over the last few days, with between 130 and 135 in local hospitals now, although the rate of intensive care unit admissions is up. The county's transmission rate is currently at 1.2, meaning one person is on average infecting 1.2 more people. That means the novel coronavirus is spreading, slowly, although local health officials worry that relaxed social distancing over Memorial Day weekend could lead to an influx of new cases next week. Meanwhile, updated models predict a fall surge of novel coronavirus cases earlier than previously expected, in mid-September instead of November. A total of 82,472 people have been tested for the novel coronavirus in Shelby County. Health officials concerned, 'not alarmed,' at daily case increase Shelby County’s recent stretch of around 100 or more new COVID-19 cases reported daily appears to be the new normal, according to David Sweat, chief of epidemiology at the Shelby County Health Department. Sweat said Thursday that 12 out of the past 14 days have seen reported case count increases of more than 90. Recent mass testing events in places like long-term care facilities could be contributing to higher daily case numbers, he said. Sweat added that more opportunities for the virus to spread occur when more people can gather together. Shelby County is currently in Phase 2 of its “Back to Business” reopening plan, which allows for purposeful groups of 50 or fewer people. Phase 1 only allowed for groups of 10 or fewer. “It’s undoubtedly the case that the greater the density of encounters, the more people that gather together, the virus has more opportunities to find a new host,” Sweat said. “…Yes, we are concerned. Are we alarmed? No, we are not alarmed.” Sweat said the peak number of COVID-19 patients in Shelby County is expected to arrive in the fall, between Labor Day and Thanksgiving. “We anticipate that we will continue to increase cases throughout the summer, and that sometime this fall is when we will crest the first wave of the peak of the epidemic,"" he said. ""That’s what the modeling data suggests right now."" City said Memphis residents producing more waste during pandemic The City of Memphis said Wednesday that trash collection had been delayed due to the increase in waste being produced by residents as they stay home during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""With more residents required to remain home, and increased purchases of home goods due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our residential trash volume has increased by approximately 30 percent,"" the city said in a Facebook post. The city said it has hired additional contractors to assist city sanitation workers with collecting bulk waste in Cordova and Hickory Hill. Transmission rate rises One of the key metrics officials are monitoring to assess phases of reopening is on the rise, according to data obtained from the Memphis/Shelby County joint coronavirus task force. The virus transmission rate, also known as the reproduction rate, estimates the number of people that each COVID-19 patient infects. That rate has climbed to 1.16 people per patient. At phase one of reopening, the rate was 1.02. Phase 2 of reopening extended to June 16 Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland signed an executive order Tuesday extending Phase 2 of the Back to Business plan for the city until at least June 16. The Shelby County Health Department said Tuesday that there were 5,134 reported cases in Shelby County, up 190 from the past day. Dr. Steve Threlkeld, co-chair of the infection control program at Baptist Memorial Hospital-Memphis, said delaying the move to Phase 3 was reasonable given the recent increase in daily reported cases. ""If we’re seeing an increase in cases, that’s probably not the time to further open things up,"" he said. ""The plan is based on data but the data is really based on what we do."" Adhering to infection control practices like handwashing and social distancing will translate to decreased transmission of the virus which makes it easier to open up, he said. Shelby County health officials say move to phase 3 likely delayed, mask mandate possible Dr. Bruce Randolph, health officer for the Shelby County Health Department, said Tuesday it was likely the move from phase 2 to phase 3 of the county reopening plan would be delayed, due to an uptick of reported cases and worry about continued increases in the coming days and weeks. Randolph also said a mandate requiring Shelby County residents to wear masks or face coverings any time they left their home and interacted with other people could be implemented if case counts continue to rise. ""Let me make everyone aware and be on notice. If our numbers continue to increase, we will have no other choice but to mandate that facial coverings be required of everyone when you are out of your home and you are in the presence of someone else (or) entering into an establishment,"" he said. However, he said the health department did not want to resort to a mandate yet and he wanted to give the community more time to voluntarily comply with masking recommendations. An ordinance mandating masks in public spaces was tabled by the Memphis City Council Tuesday morning. It could be brought back up for further discussion or a vote at any time. Watch live: COVID-19 task force update 5,314 COVID-19 cases reported in Shelby County The Shelby County Health Department announced there were 5,314 COVID-19 cases in the county Tuesday morning — 190 more cases than the total reported Monday morning. Four new deaths related to the virus were also reported Tuesday. As of Tuesday morning, there were 1,604 active cases, while 3,597 people have recovered from the novel coronavirus. More than 78,104 people have been tested in Shelby County for COVID-19, an increase of 2,504 tests from the figure reported Monday. Health department stops face masks distribution The Shelby County Health Department announced Monday it will no longer distribute the black face masks provided by the State of Tennessee for the public. The masks, manufactured by Renfro Corp., were treated with a chemical called Silvadur, an anti-microbial agent applied to reduce the growth of odor-causing bacteria, according to a press release. The manufacturer said only trace amounts of the chemical are applied to the fabric and it diminishes each time the masks are washed. As a result, the SCHD has stopped all distribution of the masks until more information is made available about Silvadur. The county health department said anyone who has one of the masks and has safety concerns about it, should stop wearing it and wear an alternative facial covering. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has information and guidance about facial covering, including making cloth facial coverings. It can be found here.

Toss it. Sneer at it. Perhaps mumble “Sure, like you understand anything about it” or “I don’t have time for his pious gibberish.” I get that. If, in fact, you are Black, please don’t toss this piece just yet. I’m writing to agree with you. Far too much time has passed with hardly any progress made. Oh, lots and lots of discriminatory laws have been struck off the books and better ones written. But nothing has changed. Not really. Not down deep where it makes a difference. Hatred still rules. The justice system is still weighted against African Americans. In the last six years, Michael Brown was shot dead by a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Eric Brown died in New York City while gasping “I can’t breathe!” as he was being crushed by police officers. When banners reading “Black Lives Matter” began to appear, they were dismissed by most White onlookers — and mocked by some. The mocking was often direct and immediate by the counter-response of Confederate flags. Say what you will in its defense, that flag scorns and offends African Americans. That pointed out, the reply is likely to be some form of “Who cares! Let ’em get over it!” You don’t get over slavery, beatings, rape, lynchings, Jim Crow, and countless other forms of dehumanization. Tell a former-P.O.W. to the Nazis or Japanese to “get over” the proud display of a Swastika or Rising Sun Flag on the Fourth of July. You might hear that elderly veteran voice feelings similar to the ones generated in a Black person by your proud display of the battle flag of the Confederacy. (But that person of color just might feel physically unsafe to say what the P.O.W. could exclaim with deep passion — and with your sympathetic agreement!) Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old unarmed Black jogger, was shot dead by two White men in Brunswick, Georgia. It happened on February 23 and was recorded on video. No arrests were made until May. Now the two persons in the video and the person who recorded it are all charged with murder. But for protests, charges might never have been filed. George Floyd of Minneapolis also died on camera. A White police officer pinned the 46-year-old man to the ground with a knee pressed to his neck for almost nine minutes. Both the victim and bystanders pleaded for the officer to take his knee off the man’s neck. He said he couldn’t breathe. Then you see his eyes close and his breathing stop. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Four police officers directly involved in the incident were fired almost immediately. Police departments around the country spoke quickly to condemn the unjustified and pitiless tactics used against Mr. Floyd. The man whose knee was on his throat has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Now the anger of people — both White and Black — has taken them to the streets to protest this latest injustice. Several of the protests have turned violent. There have been riots and fires, looting and gunfire. Even more people are dead and injured. This sort of violent retaliation against genuine injustice will set back the cause it was meant to champion. It will be used as justification for even more aggressive tactics against distressed neighborhoods populated by a disproportionate number of minorities. Those tactics will be the trigger for more protests. Some of them will erupt in violence. Thus, the seemingly endless cycle keeps on repeating itself. The majority of White-race police officers are not bigots. The majority of young Black-race males are not criminals. The majority of human-race Americans are heartbroken that our hand-wringing, sensitivity training, and diversity seminars have not broken this evil cycle. Only face-to-face conversation, shared meals with people different from ourselves, and serious redemptive work on our hearts can really change anything. The senseless repeat of quiet racism, noisy injustice, violent destruction, forceful suppression, deepening hatreds, more seminars — as we return to the pseudo-equilibrium of quiet racism again — must be stopped. ◆◆◆ Shelly is a philosopher-theologian in Spring Hill who writes regularly for the Daily Herald.

WBBJ 7 Eyewitness News Reporter Julia Ewoldt listened to a poem from a local police officer Monday. “There is a particular dichotomy that accompanies being black while blue. If you say my blue life matters, then my black life should too.” The above excerpt begins a poem titled “The Dichotomy of Black & Blue”, written by Lieutenant Nick Glenn with the Milan Police Department. “I supervise the SROs, the school resource officers, and I’m assigned as a detective, and I just come to work and do the best I can every day,” Glenn said. “When I take off my badge, and put it up for the night, or put my uniform in the closet, I can go somewhere and no one immediately know I’m a police officer. But everywhere I go, they immediately know I’m a black man.” Glenn shared the poem via his Facebook page following recent events that led to protests and riots across the country. “You see things going on in other cities across the country that are blatantly wrong that you just don’t agree with, but it still affects you on a human level, on top of being a police officer,” Glenn said. “So we are all different, we all have different backgrounds. We all have different culturally experiences we go through.” Read the full poem below.",0.0

More on those in a sec, but first... Medics supporting demonstrators douse a protester hit with tear gas after a confrontation with police during a protest against police brutality and the death of George Floyd downtown Memphis, Tenn., on Sunday, May 31, 2020. (Photo: Henry Taylor / The Leaf-Chronicle) Mistakes — and heroes — were made last night in Memphis. As several hundred protesters marched north on Riverside Drive toward the Interstate 40 bridge, law enforcement officers in full riot gear blocking the way fired tear gas canisters and pepper spray into the crowd at about 11:15 p.m. near Bass Pro Shops. It's not clear which of the several law enforcement agencies made the call although Memphis police spokeswoman Karen Rudolph last night said it wasn't MPD. It seemed like an unprovoked escalation hours into a mostly peaceful protest against police brutality and demanding justice for George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, three black people whose deaths have sparked protests across the country. As the tear gas cleared, leaving protesters gagging, coughing and teary-eyed, people rushed in to help lead people to safety and douse their eyes with milk. And although they were shouted back by protesters, two officers began advancing toward the crowd in what looked like an attempt to help someone who was lying on the ground nearby. Protesters got the message that law enforcement wasn't going to allow a reenactment of the July 2016 protest that shuttered the city's main commercial thoroughfare for hours. CLOSE Memphis police use what appears to be tear gas to break up a crowd of protesters marching toward I-40 late Sunday night, May 31, 2020. Memphis Commercial Appeal And then, at about 11:45 p.m., after marching past the Shelby County Criminal Justice Center at 201 Poplar, about 20 people rushed the convenience store at the Downtown Express Marathon gas station on Poplar, west of Danny Thomas, taking some small items like bags of chips in the couple of minutes before officers arrived on the scene. What some of the cameras didn't catch were the vast majority of protesters shouting at them not to do it, shouting that looting would only undercut the message of the protest. Later, Winfield's Shoes & Accessories on Main Street — a black-owned business and staple of Downtown retail — had its display window broken and some shoes taken: WINDOWS SMASHED ON MAIN STREET: Moments ago, our cameras captured a crowd of protesters bust out the windows of a shoe store on Main Street. https://t.co/SngywC74H5pic.twitter.com/h8WhXbA3Ip — FOX13 Memphis (@FOX13Memphis) June 1, 2020 When police responded to the ""looting"" at the gas station, a white officer started advancing menacingly toward a black man filling up his car at the gas station, seeming to think he was a protester. That's when another, black officer jumped in between them, waving his colleague away. And if he hadn't this could've been a very different column. Here's the video: There was a rush on Downtown-Express Marathon near Poplar/Danny Thomas. Police responded quickly. pic.twitter.com/wSaPgd2Kz6 — Ryan Poe 〽️ (@ryanpoe) June 1, 2020 That wasn't the only courageous act of the night. I saw people jump in front of a law enforcement SUV to allow protesters to safely pass — and stay there, even after the officer inside kept lurching the vehicle forward threateningly. And who knows how many tragedies were avoided because protesters and police restrained their more hot-headed brethren, in some cases pulling them away from the thick of the action? At the end of the protest, in the early hours of this morning, police charged into the crowd, detaining at least 10 people, although it's not clear how many were arrested. Police moved abruptly to arrest peaceful protesters I was with. Then they pushed me back and forced me to move down the mall. They made 3-4 arrests. They had one man on the ground. pic.twitter.com/X6uQoYye4S — Katherine Burgess〽️ (@KathsBurgess) June 1, 2020 Shelby County Commissioner Van Turner criticized one arrest in particular. But while other cities burn, no buildings were torched in Memphis. Little was stolen. And — most importantly — no one was reported seriously injured. Sure, mistakes were made on both sides. Police could have showed more solidarity and less antagonism toward protesters. (One county officer, in particular, while riding in the back of a truck on Riverside yelled ""Move, motherf----rs!"" at protesters unnecessarily and repeatedly.) And, sure, protesters did their fair share of provoking officers as well. But that the protests were as peaceful and successful as they were is thanks in no small part to small acts of heroism by good people on both sides of the barricades.

Three bizarre things from last night So, the serious bits about last night's protest aside, let's talk about the not-serious parts. Here are three bizarre/funny/weird things that happened... Smoke gets in your eyes. Shortly before law enforcement officers really started firing tear gas canisters, the crowd briefly stampeded on Riverside Drive because they thought they had. The rumor in the crowd was that it was all thanks to the excessive smoke from someone's vehicle. Drop it like it's hawt. As the protest headed south down Front toward the University of Memphis law school, a woman stopped her car in the middle of the street and — I kid you not — started twerking. It's unclear whether she was showing solidarity with protesters or just crossing ""twerk in the middle of the street"" off of her bucket list. Water under the bridge. In front of the law school, a protester apparently threw a water bottle in the direction of a police officer. Unfazed, the officer picked it up, said ""Thanks for the water!"" and took a big — and possibl unsanitary — swig. New study bolsters case for TVA exit Finally, after months of waiting, Memphis has a better idea of the costs and benefits of buying power from someplace other than the Tennessee Valley Authority. Siemens on Friday released the long-awaited, MLGW-commissioned ""integrated resource plan"" (IRP), which highlighted two scenarios where Memphis spends about $14.5 billion between 2020 and 2039, and in return saves $150 million a year compared to the $1 billion it's spending now, our Sam Hardiman reports. Savings aren't the only consideration — reliability is a major one as well — but this study confirms what advocates for leaving TVA have said all along: that it will bring long-term savings. And let's not forget that studies paid for by advocates have shown even greater savings. The city is in a budget crunch thanks to COVID-19, which makes the enticement of savings all the more mouth-watering for elected officials. There's more work to be done before a decision is made, but the IRP puts Memphis that much closer to leaving TVA. Speaking of leaving TVA: Entergy, which operates in Arkansas and Mississippi, would love to sell Memphis power and is open to the idea of teaming up to build the power plants that could be required for Memphis to leave TVA, Sam also reports.

Strickland said the curfew could persist as long as necessary, indicating it will likely be renewed. It does not apply to those deemed ""essential workers"" as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the property damage seen Sunday night and early Monday prompted the decision to issue the curfew. Memphis' curfew is the first in recent memory and likely the first since a 1978 police and firefighter strike that resulted in Mayor Wyeth Chandler calling in the National Guard. Strickland announced the curfew at an afternoon news conference that followed the fifth night of protests in Memphis against nationwide police brutality, particularly the recent deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville. During the news conference and in announcing the curfew, Strickland praised how peaceful Memphis protests had been and the passion he had seen. ""The first thing I'd like to say is, 'Thank you'. Thank you to the protesters in Memphis...who are conducting themselves in a peaceful and powerful manner. I applaud you for your leadership and passion. "" Strickland said. ""I know that you're hurting and that you're angry and that you want change... The needless death of George Floyd and too many other souls around our country serve as constant reminder that we must do better..."" In contrast to other parts of the U.S., the protests in Memphis have been relatively calm despite isolated confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement. The Tennessee National Guard was present in Memphis on Sunday and would likely remain so, Strickland and MPD Director Mike Rallings said during the news conference. Protest, largely peaceful, grew unruly Sunday night's protest, which lasted into the wee hours of Monday morning, was largely peaceful and featured mass civil disobedience that included shutting down Interstate 55 south of Downtown Memphis for more than an hour and multiple attempts to access either the I-55 bridge south of Downtown and Hernando de Soto Bridge, which is where Interstate 40 crosses the Mississippi River. Memphis protests: Demonstrators confront law enforcement throughout Sunday night The protest, during which hundreds chanted about racial injustice and deaths of African Americans at the hands of police, traveled for miles around Downtown Memphis and into parts of South Memphis. The attempts to scale bridges were rebuffed by law enforcement, who blocked the roads with barricades and personnel bearing riot shields, then later, once protesters attempted to reach the de Soto bridge, tear gas and smoke bombs. The firing of tear gas, which led to visible distress among many protesters, appeared to change the mood of the demonstration. From then on, the protest grew unruly. Some of the hundreds marching down Poplar Avenue charged the Downtown Express convenience store, causing mild damage. The Memphis Police Department moved in and told the crowd to disperse. Officers followed the crowd and shoved some with riot shields, but the police did not follow protesters further down Danny Thomas Boulevard. Shelby County Sheriff deputies pepper spray members of a crowd that marched up Riverside and confronted the police line during a protest against police brutality and the death of George Floyd downtown Memphis, Tenn., on Sunday, May 31, 2020. (Photo: Henry Taylor / The Leaf-Chronicle) Later, the evening saw more disorder when protesters once again approached the de Soto Bridge from Riverside Drive. A few members of the crowd approached the waiting line of Tennessee Highway Patrol and Shelby County Sheriff's Office personnel. When they got close, smoke bombs were thrown by law enforcement and some demonstrators who made it closer were sprayed with mace or pepper spray. Tear gas was fired again in response to the thrown rocks. That response from law enforcement largely broke the organized nature of the crowd. For the better part of the next hour, from about midnight to 1 a.m. Monday, there were isolated confrontations between demonstrators and police. Some in the crowd — it was unclear if they had been among those marching earlier — threw items through windows at Winfield's Fine Shoes and the Courtyard Marriott on Main Street. At about 1 a.m. law enforcement, mostly the Memphis Police Department, ordered those still out to go home and arrested some of those who did not comply. While some police arrested protesters they caught, others were seen catching protesters and then telling them to go home.

But he wrote in a post Monday on Medium that the ""the small minority of folks who've resorted to violence"" at many demonstrations are ""putting innocent people at risk, compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause."" He recounted seeing an interview, where he said, ""I saw an elderly black woman being interviewed today in tears because the only grocery store in her neighborhood had been trashed. If history is any guide, that store may take years to come back. So let's not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."" The country's first African American president weighed in after the nation experienced a sixth night of protests — which in some cities turned violent — following the death of Floyd, a black man, after being kneeled on by at least one Minneapolis officer, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The Democrat, who often admonishes people to vote, said that ""we should be fighting to make sure that we have a president, a Congress, a U.S. Justice Department, and a federal judiciary that actually recognize the ongoing, corrosive role that racism plays in our society and want to do something about it."" But he wrote that the officials ""who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system"" work at the state and local levels. Mayors and county executives, Obama wrote, appoint police chiefs and negotiate with police unions, while district attorneys and state's attorneys ""decide whether or not to investigate and ultimately charge those involved in police misconduct."" All are elected positions, Obama said, which usually suffer from ""pitifully low"" voter turnout, ""especially among young people — which makes no sense given the direct impact these offices have on social justice issues, not to mention the fact that who wins and who loses those seats is often determined by just a few thousand, or even a few hundred, votes."" Obama established a task force on ""21st-century policing"" in 2014 after Michael Brown's shooting death by police in Ferguson Mo., which led to violence there. Many police and criminal justice reforms outlined by Obama and his Justice Department have been abandoned during the Trump administration. President Trump has called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" and urged state and local governments to take aggressive action to quell any violent unrest. ",0.0

I'm Terry Gross. Like so many Americans and people around the world, I was horrified watching the video of the police officer - now charged with manslaughter and third-degree murder - who had his knee on George Floyd's neck for over eight minutes, keeping the weight on Floyd's neck even after he died. My heart was broken. It was broken again over the weekend as I watched peaceful protests against the death of Floyd and other black men and women who died at the hands of police become violent confrontations in cities around America, including Philadelphia, where I live, and Brooklyn, where I grew up. Philadelphia has been preparing to allow businesses that were closed due to the pandemic to reopen this Friday. Now in the heart of our business and shopping district that also has medical offices, food markets, pharmacies and many apartments, stores have had their windows broken, been looted, some set on fire and destroyed. Just a few days ago, the streets were pretty empty, with people practicing social distancing. By the weekend, in Philly and cities around the country, thousands of people were in the streets, which public health officials fear could lead to a surge in cases of COVID-19. We asked Eric Adams to join us because he has insights about this moment from several perspectives. When he was 15, he was arrested and beaten by police. He later became a police officer with the intent of helping to reform the police. In 1995, he co-founded the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care to work from within the NYPD against police brutality and racial profiling. After serving on the force for 22 years, retiring as a captain, he served in the New York State Senate for seven years. He was elected Brooklyn borough president in 2013 and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn's CEO. Brooklyn has been a pandemic hot spot and the location of large protests, some of which turned violent. Eric Adams, welcome back to FRESH AIR. We're recording this late Sunday afternoon. We don't know what will happen Sunday night. What are your concerns about the actions of the police and the protesters in Brooklyn? ERIC ADAMS: Many levels, Terry. I have mixed emotions. No. 1, I'm extremely excited and pleased to see our young people taking to the streets. Historically, the winds of change, they have always been blown by young adults. Young people are very much a part of the movement. And we're seeing that they are lifting their voices. And so I'm happy to see that, but I'm also concerned because embedded into a righteous movement is a group of well-trained people who - their goal is not police abuse but disruption. They're trained on incendiary devices, how to make them. They're trained on how to agitate. Some of them are carrying firearms. And if we're not careful, they will hijack this righteous movement, and that alarms me and concerns me. GROSS: Who do you think those well-trained people are and who do you think trained them? What do you know about that? ADAMS: It's a combination. Some of them, believe it or not - this strange marriage has been created between right-wing militias who have infiltrated the bodies of some of these movements across our country and even here in New York, and others are those who are just believers that we need to burn down our cities. I know that they had groups here staking out the city to see how police move and where police are located. I've been debriefed on some of the people who have been involved. Like, one car we found in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, had several Molotov cocktails and a tank full of gasoline to make incendiary devices. The young lady who pulled up at the 88th Precinct, what happened to have been one of my precincts as an officer, she pulled up and threw a Molotov cocktail at a police vehicle. We're seeing jeeps burned and vans burned. And the young African Americans who are fighting police abuse all across the country, they are doing it in a peaceful fashion. And if we're not careful, those who have infiltrated these peaceful, righteous groups are going to put these young people in a very harmful state. GROSS: What's your reaction, as a former police officer, to seeing police precincts in Brooklyn under attack? I mean, protesters tried to breach and enter a police precinct in Brooklyn, and outside Brooklyn's 88th Precinct, there was another large clash with crowds. What's your reaction to that? Like, how do you think police should be handling it when their precincts come under attack? ADAMS: And that's so important because look at the last series of marches that really put in place serious changes across the country. When you looked at those marches, you did not see people go into the 88th Precinct and other precincts in this city; you saw the organizers, the marches, you saw them stop businesses, stop traffic, maybe stop transportation. They were doing die-ins. They were doing real things to allow their voices to be heard. And that's why we have to ask, what's different here? How did we go from those extremely important ways of being heard to a point that we are actually trying to take over precincts, that we're firebombing vehicles? I was out last night at 1:30 in the morning on Flatbush Avenue and saw the number of businesses that were destroyed. And as I went into Clinton Hill, I saw property owners, people who actually own homes, I saw their homes damaged as well. And so we must make sure that we have the right balance between public protection from our police officers and to weed out those who are damaging what these young people are doing. I've been speaking with the Black Lives Matters organizers of Brooklyn and others who are part of the righteous pursuit to end police brutality to show them how to distance themselves from those who are trying to hijack their movement. GROSS: Would you like to see people from Black Lives Matter speaking out against the violence and distancing themselves from it? ADAMS: Yes, I would. And that is part of the conversation that I've had with some of the leaders. And I understand their concerns because they don't want to give a pathway. Sometimes when you speak out against something, it's manipulated in another fashion, and so they are extremely concerned about that. And we're trying to find a way that they can effectively distance themselves from what they're seeing but, at the same time, keep the focus on the mission of turning around police abuse. But I guess I would like to do that, and that is part of the conversations I've been having with them. GROSS: And let's get back to the police. I know - like, because we talked about this once before on the show - when you were a police officer, there were times when, during the day, you would be joining protesters against police abuse, and then in the evening, you'd be policing the protesters in your job as a police officer. And people would make assumptions about you as an officer, assumptions that were often not true, about where your sympathies lay. So let's talk about policing right now. I suspect that a lot of police officers sympathize with the protesters, yet at the same time, cannot allow violence in their cities. They can't allow the destruction of property, although all of that has happened anyways. Talk a little bit from your perspective as a former police officer what you think the police are up against and the kind of difficult decisions they have to make. ADAMS: That's a great question because - and you're right. The - remember; we recruit police officers from a society that is filled with healthy and toxic individuals. And when you come into the law enforcement arena, many of the individuals who are not suitable to be a police officer, they find root in a culture that really protected even the toxic individuals. The police department - actually, the police departments across America - they have never been good at immediately weeding out those who are not suitable. To have two of the most important rights that a human being can have in a country like America - the right to take freedom and the right to take away one's life - those are rights that not even the president - thank God, with this president - a president doesn't even have. So when you give someone those rights, you need to have an awesome amount of oversight, an awesome amount of obligation, and we have not done that historically. And when you look at the video footage - I've been closely watching the video footage, and I've been - I have intentionally went to many of the protests last night. I was - like I said, I was on Flatbush Avenue watching some of the interaction. When you look at the video footage, there's something that is glaring. There is a body of officers who are really suited to do this type of enforcement, and then there's a body of officers that are really not suited to do it. Now, what do I mean by that? And, Terry, we really need to reexamine how we assign police officers in our country. Everyone who is in the occupation is not suitable for every role in the occupation. There are officers that I, as a platoon commander, I enjoyed having with me when I had to kick in a door to go after someone that was committing a crime, had a gun. But I wouldn't want that same person with me if I was speaking to someone that was trying to talk someone off a ledge or dealing with a hostage situation. And so we don't assign officers based on their abilities to carry out the crafts that are needed in a particular time. Policing basically just brings everyone together. Saying, if you have on a blue uniform, you're suitable to do all the jobs - that is a big mistake, and we need to change that. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams. He's the borough president of Brooklyn. He's a former New York City police officer who co-founded 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, which was a police reform group against racial profiling and police assaults. He was also assaulted by the police when he was 15. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams, and we're talking about the protests over the weekend. At age 15, he was beaten by police. And in the hope of helping reform the policing of black people and neighborhoods, he joined the New York City police and, after 22 years, retired as a captain. He became a state senator in New York and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn Borough president, the CEO of Brooklyn. Brooklyn has been a site of large protests against the death of George Floyd in police hands. It's also been a hot spot in the pandemic. Were you ever, as a police officer, patrolling a protest that turned violent? And if so, what was that like for you? What were some of the most complicated actions and decisions you had to make? ADAMS: Extremely complicated, extremely frightening. Even when you put on a blue uniform, you do not take away the fright and flight hard-wiring inside you. And the goal is I go in with the mindset - or whoever I'm working with, I'm asking them before I start it - as a football team goes into a huddle, I go into a huddle and say, listen; we are our brother's keeper. That was the No. 1 thing I told my officers at several protests. I was here in the midst of many of the stop-and-frisk protests, the Abner Louima protest, the Dorismond protest - some of the real height - and I policed under Giuliani's administration and under Bloomberg and Commissioner Kelly. We had protests all the time. What I learned was that if you make sure that the officers know that you are my brother's keeper and if I am going over the edge, if I'm not doing the job the way it's supposed to because my adrenaline is flowing and I am responding instead of being the professional I ought to be, stop me, pause me, pull me to the side, take me, disengage me. And there were times when a person was extremely difficult to deal with - in some cases violent dealing with them - that you have to do the necessary force to terminate the condition. What you're seeing in some of the videos, you're seeing people handcuffed, and officers are still swinging their baton, and no one is stopping them. We're not teaching de-escalation. We teach de-escalation of the person who's committing the act; we're not teaching de-escalation of the officers who are trying to terminate the act. And I always instructed my officers when I was a sergeant, a lieutenant and a captain the skill of de-escalation and being your brother's keeper to prevent an incident getting out of hand. GROSS: We've all seen in times during the protests over the weekend when protesters were intentionally provoking the police - throwing things at them, setting their cars on fire. From your perspective as a former police officer who opposes police brutality, who opposes racial profiling, who opposes these murders of black people, what is the response a police officer should have when they are intentionally being violently provoked? ADAMS: It's so important. And my history - this is my life's work, dealing with police abuse, from being arrested as a young man, being told by civil rights leaders to go into the police department. I'm committed to having effective policing, but I'm also committed to something else. I'm committed to public safety. And in those cases where you see police vehicles being burned, where you see rocks being thrown, those people should be immediately apprehended and arrested. And we have to be swift about it, and we have to be - have a zero-tolerance. So that zero-tolerance of not allowing police to be abusive must also be a zero-tolerance not to allow people to attack police because that uniform is not the person in the uniform; it's the symbol of our stability. I know it has been a symbol of pain, but it also has been a symbol of the stability of this country and this city. And we need to reform it, but we can never tear down that stability that we use. So I don't go - I'm not part of that group that says disband the police departments. I'm not part of that group that says we can live in a society with no police at all. You do need some form of law and order and not unlawfulness and disorder. GROSS: Let's talk about what happened to you when you were 15 and that - how that affected your view of the police. I mean, you had been charged with trespassing. Just give us a brief sense of what the charge was. ADAMS: I was a 15-year-old child. I grew up - part of my childhood was in Bayside High School, when I left Brooklyn before returning. And my brother and I, we were arrested for criminal trespassing. Once the officers took us to the precinct - they picked us up from school, took us to the precinct. And they were filling out the paperwork, and out of nowhere, they said, you feel like a beat down? And they brought the two of us - we thought we were being transported somewhere. But they took us to the lower part of the 103rd Precinct, the same precinct Sean Bell was killed in. And they just started kicking us in the groin, you know, repeatedly. It was unbelievable. I remember acting like I passed out to get them to stop. The pain was just excruciating, if you can only imagine. And we - you know, I know I urinated blood for a week after that. And I remember every day saying to myself, Terry, that, you know, I'm going to tell my mother if it doesn't stop after the next day, the next day. And eventually, it concluded. And we never talked about that, my brother and I, until we were adults. And I think until this day, he still is suffering from mental health illness because of that because I experience PTSD. I could not see a police car go by without reliving that moment. I could not see a police show on TV. Every time I heard a siren - can you imagine just having that part of the wiring in your brain? And I think oftentimes police officers that have bad intentions do that to young people to - almost like slave masters used to do horrific things to instill fear into slaves. And it wasn't until after Randolph Evans was shot and killed that a group of leaders in Brooklyn from the Black United Front told me and 13 others to go into law enforcement. I didn't want to do that. I was a computer programmer. I wanted to open my own firm and become Cisco qualified. But I felt obligated, and it really was a life-changing experience for me, and it allowed me to turn that pain into purpose. And you know what? I finally found the refuge I needed, that I no longer felt the trauma from that beating. I felt as though that demasculation (ph) was behind me because I was using that pain in a way of turning around the lives of people. GROSS: So you're in a position of understanding the pain that a lot of black people feel when they think about the police. Were police ever a good force in your life before you became an officer? Did they ever help you or protect you? ADAMS: No. And it's unfortunate that there was always this adversarial relationship with law enforcement. And remember - you know, you don't call the police in South Jamaica, Queens, or Brownsville or East New York to invite them to a party; you call them when someone shot up the party. So when you have a relationship with an entity in your community that is only built on when there is something terribly wrong, you begin to associate pain with the profession. And so that is why proactive policing is so important in changing - how we utilize our law enforcement community is so important because I didn't have those good stories that some of my colleagues - when I attended Bayside High School and I used to hear - some of the students in the class talked about the good things they did, you know, with the police, how some of them were in the Boy Scouts or was part of the DARE program and just these interactions. And I was like, what are you talking about? They're cops. Who - (laughter) you know, who has these relationships with cops? And it was difficult because there was nothing, no point of reference of the beauty of having a good relationship with your law enforcement in your community. GROSS: My guest is Eric Adams, a former NYPD police captain. In 1995, he co-founded the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care to work from within the NYPD against police brutality and racial profiling. He now serves as Brooklyn bureau president. We'll talk more after a break. And then later, Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel by Brit Bennett, whose first novel, the bestseller ""The Mothers,"" was optioned by Kerry Washington. And David Bianculli will review three TV shows, one from the new streaming service HBO Max. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DARRELL GRANT'S ""FILS DU SOLEIL (FOR TONY WILLIAMS)"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams. At age 15, he was beaten by police. In the hope of helping reform the policing of black neighborhoods, he joined the New York City Police and, after 22 years, retired as a captain. He became a state senator and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn borough president, the CEO of Brooklyn. Brooklyn has been the site of large protests against the death of George Floyd in police hands. Brooklyn is also a hotspot for the pandemic. You know, I really do think there's a lot of police officers around the country who are really angry and really furious about what happened to George Floyd. And they're probably suffering too because now they're out on the streets in the middle of a pandemic fighting with people that they don't want to be in confrontation with. What do you think police can do or should do to show their anger at police who behave badly or brutally, or who are, you know, responsible for the deaths of people? ADAMS: We have to really change the culture of policing. We have police here in the city that put up a white power finger sign. And all the other police officers started cheering and laughing with them. When you have some of the actions of - we almost have to rebuild our law enforcement community because the recruitment effort we did, we focus on law enforcement, again, and not on how we deal with social issues - and build this symbiotic relationship between our policing community. And then you have to change the culture of really supporting a climate, a healthy climate, where an officer could come forward and report abuse without any form of reprisal. We must refocus and revamp police. And I think this is an opportunity to do so, as we saw in New Jersey some of the police chiefs marching with some of the demonstrators. And something else happened with the Floyd case that some people may have overlooked - it was a significant moment - one, the expeditious fashion in which the police officer was fired, second, how fast the prosecutor indicted. Now, the indictment itself is troubling to me, which is another conversation. But they moved quickly. The third - the other officers were fired. They should also be arrested. But the mere fact they were fired was a cosmic shift in policing, because the tone is now set that your actions will also - you're responsible for not only for your actions, but the actions of the person who you are near. Standing around watching someone choke to death, you should be held accountable the same way as someone participated in a robbery. They acted in concert. That is how we should treat those officers that are carrying out these actions. GROSS: I know a lot of people would agree with you that there's been, you know, progress made in how fast these actions were taken. But that doesn't seem to have had any effect on the protests. ADAMS: And it shouldn't. We have to keep the pressure on. We have a long way to go. And I am - as I stated, I'm excited about these protests because it is as though I've come full circle. I've marched in these protests when we were fighting against stop-and-frisk. I remember looking beside me and seeing these different ethnic groups who peacefully joined with me. I recall that the - in the protests, as you indicated, taking off my jeans and shirt and putting on my police uniforms and feeling as though my day was fulfilled. I felt accomplished. I felt as though I was able to protect the city and, at the same time, force them to allow our police agencies to become who and what they are. And I think these protests play a significant role, because let's face it, a absence of the Dr. Kings, the SNCCs, the Rosa Parks and so many others, America would not have moved in the area that it should have moved. We would've never signed civil rights bills. We would have never done some of the things that we did. If it wasn't for the women's suffrage movement, we would still probably not have women voting. Hitting the streets and showing you're outraged and not comfortable is something that's part of America as apple pie and Chevrolet. And we need to continue to hit the streets to move America where it ought to go. GROSS: Right now, given how hot the situation is, do you want to see people continuing to hit the streets? ADAMS: It's a very delicate balance. I'm really afraid about the COVID-19. As you know, I spent the last 50-plus days sleeping in my office from the time that COVID hit the shores here in New York City. And what we have done around this issue - and the same communities that are dealing with police abuse are the communities that were negatively impacted disproportionately by coronavirus. And so I'm afraid that many of our young people are going to take the infection home to their loved ones, their seniors, their grandmothers. And it is a true concern. And when I saw people participating in the protest, I did see some who were wearing face mask. But clearly, an overwhelming number of them were not practicing social distancing. I am concerned that, you know, body fluids, being in close proximity is going to have family members that are going to be infected. Young people who are going to leave the protests and go home, they are going to infect their loved ones. And COVID virus is serious, is real. And the same communities that are dealing with police abuse were disproportionately impacted by the lack of government response to coronavirus. GROSS: I'm obviously really worried about that, too. And, you know, Brooklyn has been a pandemic hotspot. And, you know, in Philly, Philly's preparing to reopen on Friday. Philly was preparing to go yellow. And now, like, who knows what the consequences for the pandemic will be from all the protests over the weekend? And I'm sure that's true for many cities. Like, we know what happened in New Orleans after Mardi Gras. And this was not a celebratory parade. These were protests. But it's still, in terms of the virus, it can have the same impact of thousands of people in the streets, shoulder-to-shoulder. Many of them were wearing masks. But at that close proximity, you know, who knows? How much of a setback do you fear this will be for Brooklyn, where you are the Brooklyn borough president? ADAMS: I think it's going to be a significant setback. But what I've learned - I recall after 9/11. And when the Trade Center was attacked and the buildings collapsed, I remember going out to Brownsville, a predominately black community, to talk to the young people and deal with the trauma of the buildings collapsing. And they were playing basketball and just hanging out. And I've told them, did you hear what happened? They said, Eric, we were catching hell when those buildings were up. We didn't have heat at night. We had lead paint. Crime was high. We were unemployed. Those buildings have nothing to do with us. People can feel so much pain that they become numb to the reality of danger. And I think that's what you're seeing here. Many of these young people have been living in a state of just total hopelessness and don't feel as though another level of trauma is going to do anything to dissipate the trauma that they're experiencing already. And somehow, we have to convince them that life is not about being hopeless, but about being empowered. And while we do that, we have to understand that that is why they are in the streets, not because they want to expose themselves to coronavirus. But they've reached a level of desperation where they're no longer believing society's ability to protect them from a virus or from the virus or police abuse. GROSS: Were you glad over the weekend that you are no longer a police officer? ADAMS: No, not at all. I looked forward to being in the eye of the storm. I looked forward to those difficult days when I had to talk someone down from showing a level of anger and understanding what they felt. I was the type of person that I wanted to be the platoon commander that was inside of - in charge of the detail that went out. I knew we were going to allow officers to come back safely. And I knew that the protesters were going to get home safe. And that's the type of leadership we need right now. And I think that in the police department, we have some amazing men and women who have taken upon this occupation. We need to start rewarding them for their commitment - and not only looking at how good they are at fighting crime, but how good they are at building relationships within the community. GROSS: Eric Adams, thank you so much for talking with us. And I hope Brooklyn comes through all of this OK. ADAMS: OK. Be well. GROSS: Eric Adams is the Brooklyn borough president and a former NYPD police captain. He co-founded the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care.

Police have cited concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. The rally has been held each year since 1990 to commemorate the lives lost in the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The Chinese military opened fire on citizens who were calling for economic and democratic reforms. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil, told the South China Morning Post that alliance members still planned to enter Victoria Park to observe a moment of silence that night. The alliance also asked the public to join an online gathering and light candles across the city. NPR's Emily Feng reported that the move to deny the demonstration comes amid controversy surrounding China's proposed national security law that could limit Hong Kong's autonomy. The potential law has concerned pro-democracy advocates, and as Feng noted, ""Legal scholars question whether Beijing has the authority to impose this law on Hong Kong."" In justifying an earlier extension of restrictions to June 4, police cited a lingering threat of the spread of the coronavirus, The Guardian reported. ""Police believe the event will not only increase participants' chances of contracting the virus, but also threaten citizens' lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others,"" police said, according to the newspaper. Lee Cheuk-yan, who chairs the alliance that organized the event, told the South China Morning Post that he believes the government was using the pandemic to shut down the demonstration. ""We believe this is totally unreasonable and unscientific, because everything is normal in Hong Kong. They are just using this excuse to suppress our rally,"" he said, adding that many other facilities had already reopened. ",0.0

Protests have erupted in dozens of cities over the past week since Floyd, a black man, died after a police officer was seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck for minutes on end. ""I think the public is getting to a place that it's never been before in understanding a lot of this,"" Biden said at the event. ""But it's going to take a whole hell of a lot of hard work. A lot of hard work. But I'm confident it can be done."" Fourteen faith leaders and local lawmakers attended the event at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Del., as they donned masks and sat seated two to a pew to help maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus. Biden spent more than half of the event listening to the concerns of community leaders rather than delivering remarks. He could be seen taking notes as each attendee got up and spoke. Despite being in a room full of supporters, the group offered critical feedback to the former vice president, with some saying the black community didn't get the economic boost it needed under the Obama administration and that Biden's role in passing the 1994 crime bill makes some young black voters skeptical of him. There were recommendations to create a czar dedicated solely to the study of police brutality within Biden's first 100 days as president. Several speakers urged Biden to pick an African American woman as his vice president. U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., spoke emotionally of a recent exchange she had with a 23-year-old protester in Wilmington, who told her he was ""willing to die."" ""He said, 'I have so much rage.' And I said, 'How old are you? What's your name? How old are you?' And I just tried to hold him, COVID or not,"" the congresswoman said. After about an hour, Biden rose to address the church gathering. ""I want to make something clear: I don't expect anything from the black community,"" he said. ""It has to be earned, earned every single time."" Biden said he's spent time speaking with black thought leaders about how to move forward as a country and said people who ""don't think of themselves as having a prejudiced bone in their body"" are now reckoning with the discrimination endemic in some American institutions. ""The Band-Aid's been ripped off by this pandemic and this president. No one can pretend any longer what this is all about. Nobody can pretend who has been carrying us on our backs — it's the minorities,"" Biden said. Biden listed specific plans for his would-be administration, including heightened federal oversight over local law enforcement, additional training for police officers and increased economic opportunity for African Americans. He teased the announcement of a new economic proposal in the coming weeks, which he said will have a strong emphasis on housing, education and access to capital. ""The ultimate answer for every other group has been access to economic opportunity,"" Biden said. ""What is the future? The future is you gotta be able to get out of bed and think, 'I can make it, I can do something. The deck's not completely stacked.' "" He also stressed what he characterized as a critical need to change leadership in the Senate, particularly as it relates to confirming federal judges. ""If we don't win back the United States Senate, we're going to be in real trouble,"" Biden said. ""Presidents come and go. But I tell you what, justices don't. They last a long time."" The event ended with a prayer and Biden saying he'll rely on the group for advice throughout his campaign. ""I know I'm going to make mistakes,"" he said before quoting the expression, ""What comes from the heart goes straight to the heart."" ""It's going to come from the heart. But I'll need help,"" the former vice president said. ""I need help and advice as we go along as to what you think I should and shouldn't be doing."" The event marked Biden's third public appearance in a week, his first trips away from his home since mid-March. He has been campaigning from his house due to coronavirus lockdown orders. Biden left his home on Memorial Day to lay a wreath at a veterans park near his home, and on Sunday he visited a site in Wilmington where protesters had gathered the night before in response to Floyd's death. Biden held a virtual meeting with mayors later in the day and had virtual fundraisers planned for Monday evening. ",0.0

But some health experts, even as they urge caution, said they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat. Tens of thousands of people, masked and unmasked, have thronged the streets of Minneapolis, Atlanta, Louisville, Ky., and other cities in the week since George Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. They are the largest public gatherings in the U.S. since the pandemic forced widespread shutdowns, and many local officials warned of a possible spike in new cases in one or two weeks. ""Risk of transmission is lower in open spaces, but wherever there is a gathering there is still the risk of transmitting the virus,"" said Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. Health experts urged protesters not to sing and shout to reduce the threat of person-to-person transmission. And they cautioned that police tactics such as tear gas and pepper spray could exacerbate the situation by prompting people to cough and gasp for air. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a list of tips for demonstrators to lower their risk of contracting COVID-19, such as covering their faces and staying in small groups. ""Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead,"" the department advised. Nsoesie said that while she agrees with the sentiment, ""I can see how some of these tips can be difficult to follow. For example, if you are angry or frustrated about an issue, you want to express that feeling, and speaking is one way of doing that."" She added, ""It's also hard to keep 6 feet of distance at a protest."" Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she's worried about how consecutive days of protests could trigger an influx of COVID-19 cases. Huge demonstrations began in the nation's capital on Friday — the same day Bowser lifted stay-at-home orders and eased shutdown rules. The city is still limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people. But in the streets around the White House, that cap is regularly exceeded by orders of magnitude. ""I'm so concerned about it that I'm urging everybody to consider their exposure if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested, because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve,"" Bowser said on NBC's Meet the Press. But the risks of congregating during a global pandemic shouldn't keep people from protesting racism, according to dozens of public health and disease experts who signed an open letter in support of the protests. ""White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,"" the letter said. Initially written by infectious disease experts at the University of Washington, the letter cited a number of systemic problems, from the disproportionately high rate at which black people have been killed by police in the U.S. to disparities in life expectancy and other vital categories — including black Americans' higher death rate from the coronavirus. ""Data is showing that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in many states,"" said Nsoesie, who was not among the letter's signatories when NPR contacted her. ""Racism is one of the reasons this disparity exists."" She continued, ""Racism is a social determinant of health. It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn't weigh these crises separately."" Local governments should not break up crowded demonstrations ""under the guise of maintaining public health,"" the experts said in their open letter. They urged law enforcement agencies not to use tear gas, smoke and other irritants, saying they could make people more susceptible to infection and worsen existing health conditions. The medical professionals also acknowledged the potential for COVID-19 cases to rise in the days to come, and they called for public health agencies to boost access to care and testing in affected communities.

Barr has directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to dispatch riot teams to the nation's capital and to Miami to assist local authorities in responding to protests there, according to a senior Justice Department official. The attorney general also sent an FBI hostage rescue team to help authorities Sunday in Washington with demonstrations, the official said, adding that the federal law enforcement presence will be ""maximized"" in the city on Monday evening. The moves come as protesters continue to take to the streets in cities across the country in outrage and grief over Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis while in police custody. Video of Floyd's arrest shows him handcuffed and pinned facedown on the street. A Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, is shown kneeling on top of him with his knee pushing on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Barr has called the outrage over Floyd's death ""real and legitimate"" but said the criminal justice system must be the venue to hold those responsible to account. And he argues that is already happening. Chauvin and three other officers involved have been fired from the police force. Minnesota authorities also have charged Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter. On a parallel track, the FBI and Justice Department are conducting a separate investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated. Some of the protests against Floyd's death have turned violent and destructive. Shops in Washington, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and elsewhere have been looted, burned and destroyed. Police stations and police vehicles have been attacked. It is unclear at this point who exactly is behind the violence, but Barr and President Trump put the blame squarely on what they have labeled far-left radicals and extremists. ""Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements,"" Barr said over the weekend. ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda."" He said that in many places, the violence appears to be driven by ""anarchistic and far-left extremists, using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence."" It is unclear what Barr meant by ""antifa-like tactics,"" and he did not offer any evidence to support his assertions. A Justice Department official later said it was based on information provided by state and local authorities. On Sunday, the president went a step further and threatened to designate antifa a terrorist group, although experts said there is no legal authority that allows a domestic entity to be labeled a ""terrorist organization."" On top of that, antifa, short for anti-fascist, isn't an organization but rather a diffuse movement of activists on the far left. While Barr and Trump have put the blame on them, some state authorities, such as Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, have blamed white nationalists. He, too, did not offer evidence to support his assertion. For now, state and local police and other authorities are leading the law enforcement response to the protests. They make the arrests, although the FBI is conducting interviews to determine whether any federal laws — such as crossing state lines to conduct violence —have been violated. ",0.0

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Today I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers, that we dominate the streets. CHANG: And as President Trump made his remarks to the nation, protesters chanted outside the White House. Immediately after, the president exited the White House and walked a brief distance to St. John's Church. The historic church was damaged by a fire during the recent protests. NPR's Tim Mak joins us now from Washington with more. Hi, Tim. TIM MAK, BYLINE: Hey there. CHANG: So what are you seeing right now at the moment? MAK: So I'm at the corner of Connecticut and I Street NW, not very far from the White House. And we just saw a few dozen protesters kind of get enveloped by lines of police on either side of us. It looks like they are making arrests right now. They did let the press kind of squeeze out through an exit, but they checked all badges. And basically, anyone who didn't have a press badge at that time, it looks like, is being detained. We've now been pushed about a block away from that now. CHANG: Wow, OK. Can you describe the moment that we just mentioned, when the president left the White House on foot to visit the damaged church. Tell us what happened exactly there. MAK: Well, authorities very quickly cleared protesters from Lafayette Park in order for the president to make that short walk from the White House over there. And once there, he stood holding a Bible. The president invited other officials, including the attorney general and the White House press secretary, to join him. It's not a very large distance between those two venues. That's St. John's Church. I should mention this is a church of significant historical importance and has been visited by every president since James Madison. Now, of course, Lafayette Park is the area right in front of the White House, where a lot of demonstrators have gathered in recent days. CHANG: OK. And I know that you have been out there for a while. You have been talking to protesters. What kind of things are you hearing in reaction to the president's remarks tonight? MAK: Well, I'm not sure a lot of the people who have been out here were listening to the president's remarks in real time. CHANG: Interesting. MAK: There's a - definitely a disconnect between the people who are here demonstrating today and what the president is trying to convey from the White House, from the Rose Garden and so forth. We spoke to Joseph Varrentas (ph). He's a 28-year-old who lives here in Washington, D.C. He came down, and he said that he was protesting against violence, against some of the actions of law enforcement in recent days. We saw bruises and cuts on his arms and on his forearm. And we also observed over the course of the last hour and a half or so, you know, police pushing back against protesters. We saw some minor injuries. We saw law enforcement using riot shields and using their batons in kind of rhythmic fashion to push demonstrators back away from the White House. CHANG: Well, there is now a local curfew in effect in Washington, D.C., as of 7 p.m. Eastern. It is now 8 p.m. where you are. Does it look like that curfew is going to be enforced? Does it look like that people are going to respect it? What's your sense at this moment? MAK: When we first were walking around at around 7 o'clock, when the curfew began to take effect, we did see people leaving. But it appears now that the people who are here are the people who are willing and interested in staying and not adhering to that curfew. We are not seeing - we don't know if the curfew is being enforced or whether other issues are being enforced. As I mentioned, a few dozen protesters were just enveloped and detained right in front of us here. CHANG: All right. That is NPR's Tim Mak, who's joined us from near the White House. Tim, please stay safe. Thank you very much. MAK: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

But some health experts, even as they urge caution, said they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat. Tens of thousands of people, masked and unmasked, have thronged the streets of Minneapolis, Atlanta, Louisville, Ky., and other cities in the week since George Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. They are the largest public gatherings in the U.S. since the pandemic forced widespread shutdowns, and many local officials warned of a possible spike in new cases in one or two weeks. ""Risk of transmission is lower in open spaces, but wherever there is a gathering there is still the risk of transmitting the virus,"" said Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. Health experts urged protesters not to sing and shout to reduce the threat of person-to-person transmission. And they cautioned that police tactics such as tear gas and pepper spray could exacerbate the situation by prompting people to cough and gasp for air. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a list of tips for demonstrators to lower their risk of contracting COVID-19, such as covering their faces and staying in small groups. ""Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead,"" the department advised. Nsoesie said that while she agrees with the sentiment, ""I can see how some of these tips can be difficult to follow. For example, if you are angry or frustrated about an issue, you want to express that feeling, and speaking is one way of doing that."" She added, ""It's also hard to keep 6 feet of distance at a protest."" Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she's worried about how consecutive days of protests could trigger an influx of COVID-19 cases. Huge demonstrations began in the nation's capital on Friday — the same day Bowser lifted stay-at-home orders and eased shutdown rules. The city is still limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people. But in the streets around the White House, that cap is regularly exceeded by orders of magnitude. ""I'm so concerned about it that I'm urging everybody to consider their exposure if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested, because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve,"" Bowser said on NBC's Meet the Press. But the risks of congregating during a global pandemic shouldn't keep people from protesting racism, according to dozens of public health and disease experts who signed an open letter in support of the protests. ""White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,"" the letter said. Initially written by infectious disease experts at the University of Washington, the letter cited a number of systemic problems, from the disproportionately high rate at which black people have been killed by police in the U.S. to disparities in life expectancy and other vital categories — including black Americans' higher death rate from the coronavirus. ""Data is showing that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in many states,"" said Nsoesie, who was not among the letter's signatories when NPR contacted her. ""Racism is one of the reasons this disparity exists."" She continued, ""Racism is a social determinant of health. It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn't weigh these crises separately."" Local governments should not break up crowded demonstrations ""under the guise of maintaining public health,"" the experts said in their open letter. They urged law enforcement agencies not to use tear gas, smoke and other irritants, saying they could make people more susceptible to infection and worsen existing health conditions. The medical professionals also acknowledged the potential for COVID-19 cases to rise in the days to come, and they called for public health agencies to boost access to care and testing in affected communities.

Health experts need newly infected people to remember and recount everyone they’ve interacted with over several days in order to alert others who may have been exposed, and prevent them from spreading the disease further. But that process, known as contact tracing, relies on people knowing who they’ve been in contact with — a daunting task if they’ve been to a mass gathering. And the process relies on something that may suddenly be in especially short supply: Trust in government. “These events that are happening now are further threats to the trust we need,” said Dr. Sandro Galea, dean of the Boston University School of Public Health. “If we do not have that, I worry our capacity to control new outbreaks becomes more limited,” he said. Government officials have been hoping to continue reopening businesses, churches and other organizations after months of stay-at-home orders and other infection-prevention measures. But health experts also hoped that any reopening would be accompanied by widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation to prevent new waves of illness from beginning. Over the past week, protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned a knee to his neck, have involved thousands of people gathered tightly together in large crowds in more than 20 cities nationwide. It’s unclear if the protests themselves will trigger large new outbreaks. The protests were outside, where infections don’t spread as readily as indoors. Also, many of the protesters were wearing masks, and much of the contact was likely less-hazardous “transient” moments of people moving around, passing each other, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. But, still, experts worry that public efforts to contain the disease in the future could be undermined. In Los Angeles, the city’s mayor announced Saturday that COVID-19 testing centers were being closed because of safety concerns related to violent protests. Testing in Minneapolis will be affected because some of the clinics that provide the service have been damaged in the protests, according to a city government spokesperson. Reduced testing could “be giving the virus another head start,” Schaffner said. And contract tracing, which is only just getting going in several states, is an even bigger concern. It involves people who work for or with health departments asking intimate questions about where a person has been and who they’ve been talking to — and getting full, truthful answers in return. “In this current environment which has enhanced or brought forth a mistrust of governmental authority, it might make them disinclined to speak with anyone in government,” Schaffner said. That is especially true in black communities trying to cope with episodes of police violence and longstanding frustrations with how they have been marginalized and mistreated by people who work for government agencies. And those are the communities that have been hardest hit by the coronavirus in the U.S. and most in need of public health measures to help control it. Protests in Salt Lake City that drew several thousand people are a setback for contact tracers already struggling to contain the spread of the coronavirus, said Tair Kiphibane, infectious disease bureau manager for the Salt Lake County Health Department. She became concerned as she watched hundreds of protesters go by her downtown Salt Lake City office Saturday afternoon where she and her staff were working another weekend day after seeing increases in COVID-19 cases last week. She sent contact tracers home three hours early Saturday as protests grew violent near the office. She expects further increases in cases because so many people were close to one another during the protest. Tracing the web of infected people that may have been exposed will be daunting since protesters likely won’t have names and phone numbers for many of the people they were around. “It is going to make it so much harder,” Kiphibane said. “It could be anybody. They don’t know most of those people … It is just too many people.” In a press conference Saturday, Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington used the term “contact tracing” when describing an investigation into arrested protesters there. He said the goal is to “see if there are crime or white supremacy organizations that have played a role” and “to understand how do we go after them, legally,” Harrington said. But Harrington’s use of “contact tracing” by law enforcement may complicate the job of health workers as they try to track the virus’s spread, some experts said. “That was an abuse of the word ‘contact tracing.’ That is not what contact tracing is,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Contact tracing is a service to patients and their contacts to provide services for patients and warning for contacts. It has nothing to do with police activity. Nothing,” said Frieden, who is now president of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit that works to prevent epidemics. Galea said he hopes many people will separate in their minds the contact tracing done by public health workers from crime investigations by the police. But, he added, “I do think sometimes it’s difficult to make a distinction when you feel marginalized by, and targeted by, the entire government.”",0.0

(WKRN) — Organizers tell News 2 that a man’s arrest over the weekend has prompted an additional protest on Monday. Shortly before 2 p.m., protesters could be seen walking from the Lowe’s Home Improvement Warehouse off of Bridge Avenue to the Rutherford County Sheriff’s Office. Organizer Jaylen James said, “We had to let it be known that yesterday is not exactly what we wanted. We don’t hate police officers. I’m not anti-police but we need to look in their face and in their eyes – that this is not okay. You protect and serve us.” James continued saying their protest was in regard to the arrest of Christian Fouche shortly after Sunday’s peaceful rally in Murfreesboro. Fouche told News 2 he was planning to leave Sunday’s protest when the curfew went into place. He said as officers were trying to clear the area he was stepped on by horse from the Mounted Patrol at the Rutherford County Sheriff’s Office. Fouche said he was injured and shortly after, arrested, by a Rutherford County Sheriff’s deputy. Fouche and his attorney, Caleb Cassell, both have called into question why the arrest took place as Fouche was planning to leave, and he was injured by a deputy on horseback. Cassell said his client was charged with violating the “state-mandated” curfew. News 2 reached out to the Rutherford County Sheriff’s Office and received this information, “Fouche was originally charged with the violation of the declared emergency order.

Banks, companies that depend on consumer spending and communications companies accounted for a big slice of the gains. Health care was the only sector to fall. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of optimism among traders. Oil prices fell. Investors are balancing cautious optimism about the reopening of businesses shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic against worries that the civil unrest across the U.S. over police brutality and racism could disrupt the economic recovery and widen the outbreak.

The stock market is coming off its second month of solid gains. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. The Federal Reserve and Congress have pledged unprecedented amounts of aid for the economy. That helped spur the market’s move higher from its March lows. Now investors are betting that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. “I think we are through the worst of it for sure, and the markets reflect that in the bounce we’ve seen,” said David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs.

Memphis Commercial Appeal Mayor Jim Strickland has called for an investigation after several Memphis Police Department officers dressed in riot gear were captured on video apparently tackling a woman on Beale Street early Sunday morning. The video was captured by a Commercial Appeal reporter. In it, MPD officers can be heard yelling, ""Somebody get the girl in the gray hoodie,"" before several officers grab her and pull her down to the street. The woman was identified as Victoria Jones, 29. She was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct, rioting and resisting official detention after police attempted to break up an impromptu protest that began late Saturday night. Police shove protesters away from where they are arresting a protester they overcame on Beale Street in Memphis, Tenn., on Sunday, May 31, 2020. (Photo: Henry Taylor / The Leaf-Chronicle) Strickland watched the video. When asked whether he thought officers acted appropriately, Strickland said he needed more information. ""I think it would require interviews,"" Strickland said. ""I have to know questions like: What were the citizens told? When were they told? How often were they told? What were the interactions with this woman before? Do we believe she heard instructions if any were given? There's a whole plethora of information to really do a thorough investigation."" Strickland has also requested an investigation be conducted after a Memphis police officer was captured on camera knocking down a woman protesting on Union Avenue last week. According to police documents, Jones ""knowingly participated in a group of about 150 rioters on Beale St. and Main St."" Jones, the affidavit said, allegedly refused to leave the area after being told by police to do so on more than one occasion. When officers tried to detain her, the report said, she resisted arrest. The police report does note that Jones told police she was leaving the area, but ""that she was just not moving fast enough."" Jones is the founder of Orange Mound arts nonprofit The Collective. An impromptu protest Saturday night's incident happened as the city has seen daily protests in Downtown Memphis and across the county in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Now-fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was arrested on third-degree murder charges after video was released of him holding his knee against Floyd's neck as Floyd, who died minutes later, repeatedly yelled, ""I can't breathe."" The nightly protests started Wednesday on Union Avenue and had largely remained peaceful. Saturday's march ended at the National Civil Rights Museum just before 9 p.m. and hundreds who participated left the area. Hours after the nonviolent protest ended, a second incident between officers and a group of people, most of whom did not attend the earlier protest, began. In a statement published on Facebook Sunday afternoon, Memphis police said Saturday's incident ignited when multiple people jumped on squad cars as officers were attempting to get the group to leave the area near the intersection of Main Street and Beale Street around 10:45 p.m. Saturday. Police in riot gear wearing helmets and holding shields and wooden batons erected barricades and ordered people to leave the area around 11:30 p.m. as dozens of police cars lined Main Street on either side of the impromptu protest that formed. Over a loud speaker, officers repeatedly told the more than 100 people present to ""clear this area at once or the necessary force will be used to clear the area."" Much of the crowd remained more than an hour later. Around 12:40 a.m., police started to line up and force the crowd away. Officers on horseback led the way while those on foot beat their batons on their shields yelling ""move"" and stepping forward with each beat. The video of Jones' arrest was captured at 12:43 a.m. Jones was released from jail hours later. During a press conference Monday afternoon, MPD Director Mike Rallings did not comment on the video. He did not respond to a request for an interview with The Commercial Appeal to discuss the video and MPD's relationship with Memphis' black community. While he said he had watched several videos of MPD officers captured during the protests, it's not clear if he had watched this particular one. ""I need everybody to understand, if the police move in to make arrests, if individuals do not obey our order to disperse, an arrest is never going to be pretty,"" Rallings said. Protests continued Sunday evening. Some participants were seen throwing sticks and bottles, some glass though most were plastic, at officers in riot gear. While much of the night the protest remained nonviolent, near the end night some property was damaged and looting was reported Once during Sunday's protest, a handful of people marching down Poplar Avenue charged the Downtown Express convenience store, causing mild damage. Sometime in the night, some in the crowd — it was unclear if they had been among those marching earlier — threw items through windows at Winfield's Fine Shoes and the Courtyard Marriott on Main Street. ""In the past 48 hours, we've had 10 businesses vandalized, three police cars vandalized, three incidents of officers being shot at. This is unacceptable and it will not be tolerated,"" Rallings said at the press conference. No officers were shot. It's unclear if any of the shootings were related to the protests. Two happened in Downtown Memphis well after the protest that started Saturday night had ended. The third happened on Elvis Presley Boulevard, Rallings said. One person, 39-year-old Marinease Jamison, was arrested in the first in the series. Police documents don't link the shooting to the earlier protest. No arrests have been made in the other shootings. Sawyer calls for more investigations Shelby County Commissioner Tami Sawyer said Jones is a ""dear friend."" She and a group of others went to 201 Poplar early Sunday morning to pick up Jones. Jones was not released until the afternoon. Sawyer commended Strickland for requesting the investigation but said more investigations are needed. ""He cannot pick and choose,"" said Sawyer who ran against Strickland in the most recent mayoral election. Sawyer said she also wanted an investigation into the arrests of the other protesters who were arrested alongside Jones and into why tear gas was used on protesters the following night. ""While I am glad that Mayor Strickland is responding to the arrest of Victoria Jones, which was unnecessary and enacted violently, she was not the only person arrested,"" Sawyer said, adding that at least one other woman arrested had been injured. Sawyer went on to add that a more equitable community police strategy that activists have long been requesting is also missing. At the press conference, Rallings said the police department is always working to be better. ""You've asked about cultural sensitivity, cultural diversity, cultural awareness, deescalation, impartial policing,"" he said. ""Let me assure you we already do those things. We have outside instructors come in. Our department constantly strives to be better and to learn more ways to work with our community. ""But when you take two incidents or a handful of incidents and highlight it and paint that as the picture of the entire department, that is not correct."" Both Strickland and Rallings called the earlier nonviolent protest ""powerful"" and ""meaningful"" and said they would not impede on people's right to protest as long as they were done lawfully. A 10 p.m. curfew was announced to begin Monday night. Only essential workers and those experiencing medical emergencies would be allowed to be out without risking arrest.

It was that year when Echol Cole and Robert Walker, two black sanitation workers, were killed when they were chewed up by a malfunctioning trash compactor because Memphis’ public works department cared more about saving money than sparing black men's lives.

Tonyaa's latest: A new Tom Lee Park can bring nature to Memphis kids who can't get to Shelby Farms | Weathersbee So on Sunday, as protesters streamed past the “I Am A Man,” mural on Main Street to show their anguish and their anger at how Derek Chauvin, a white police officer in Minneapolis who kneeled on George Floyd’s neck as he begged for his life, it was hard not to notice how African Americans fight for their lives against the forces of white authority seems to be perpetual. It was hard not to notice how, 52 years ago, in Memphis we were at this same place; a place where black sanitation workers had to march in the streets just for equipment that wouldn’t kill them on the job. It's hard not to notice how, 52 years ago, a white police officer killed a black unarmed teenager who was involved in fighting for the sanitation workers’ rights. And how, as many other white police officers do today, Jones got away with it. It’s exhausting. It’s depressing. And it’s past time for it to change. Yet from what I could tell from covering the protesters on Sunday, that time may have come. More from Tonyaa: Some people found joy in COVID-19 isolation. At this virtual gathering, they'll reveal how Most of the hundreds who streamed into the streets of downtown Memphis were young – which means they came of age during the presidency of Barack Obama. Many were white and Latinx, and, like their African-American counterparts, were anxious to put hate, injustice and old divisions behind them. Many were people like 22-year-old Justice Davis, who came from Nashville to join in the protest because she was heartbroken after seeing the video of Floyd dying beneath Chauvin’s knee. Many were people like 21-year-old James Fletcher, who marched because he was tired of seeing his African-American friends grapple with casual racism every day. And many were people like 18-year-old Malik Barnes, who marched because he was tired of seeing African Americans die at the hands of the police. Like the others, Barnes was tired of seeing people like Floyd as casualties of the need for some police officers to assert their authority at the cost of black lives; tired of seeing black people, like Breonna Taylor of Louisville, become collateral damage of no-knock warrants and other police practices that do more to target black people than to protect them.

But the good thing is that the young people with the power to change that are seeing. And are determined to make others see. So, 52 years later, this history won’t be repeated.

In an interview with EFE, Linskey, currently the risk management director for the Kroll security consulting firm, said that the problem that has spurred the protests against racism and police brutality all across the US after the death of African American George Floyd at the hands of white cops on May 25 in Minneapolis is not exclusive to that city’s police department but rather a factor within US society as a whole. Linskey said that one can find the same portion of racist individuals both in police forces as in society in general, adding that that is something that has to change at all levels via education and fostering tolerance. The former Boston chief in 2014 led the police response after the Marathon bomb attack that killed three people and resulted in an unprecedented police deployment in the Massachusetts capital until the death during a police chase of Tamerlan Tsarnaev and the capture of his younger brother Dzhokhar, who staged the attack with homemade explosives. There are certain times when the police must intervene decisively and with force and there are others when the best thing is just to let things run their course to prevent confrontations and bigger problems, he said regarding the protests that have erupted around the US since Friday and in some cases have deteriorated into violent clashes with police, vandalism and the looting of stores and businesses. Linskey said he was not going to comment on what the police have done well or badly in various cities because “each police department has to deal with the situation in a different way. There is no cookie-cutter approach.” However, he was categorical in his condemnation of how the four Minneapolis officers attempted to conduct Floyd’s arrest, where one of them knelt on the handcuffed and facedown man’s neck until he lost consciousness and for several minutes after that, presumably causing his death from either asphyxiation or blocking the blood supply to his brain. Boston’s former top cop said that there have clearly been violent agitators at some of the demonstrations who have tried to destabilize things and sow chaos to take advantage of the clashes, and he asserted that “some violent actors are hijacking the peaceful and legitimate protest.” At the same time, he acknowledged, there are incidents – like ones of police vehicles running down demonstrators in New York and Los Angeles – that do not contribute to lowering tensions. “You ask me about the NYPD van ramming into people on Saturday. That is not a standard procedure for crowd control in any way. It’s counterproductive to de-escalation. I would have ordered an immediate investigation into that. Only if the lives of the officers are in danger will such behavior be justified,” he said. Regarding the situation in Minneapolis, the epicenter of the protests and a city that has been under a curfew for the past three nights, Linskey said that “What I can tell you is what I would have done in Minnesota, which is talking immediately to the community, be transparent, communicate and take measures to discipline the people involved.” “This is a process. The police have to build a connection with the community, engage and communicate for a long time,” he said. “Since Ferguson (the August 2014 Missouri incident where another unarmed black man was killed by white police), there has been a lot of professionalization of policing, with better training in community policing. For instance, there has been very good training to treat and understand people with mental health who were being victims,” he added. “So much of the blame is directed at the police, but the problem goes beyond a few bad cops – it has to do with a systemic racism that has been in place for years, and that has to change with education and other tools to change our society and the oppression of African Americans,” Linskey went on to say. Recalling an incident that took place – coincidentally – on the date of Floyd’s death in New York’s Central Park, Linskey said: “If that woman … from New York calls 911 because she’s a racist and thinks a black man is harassing her, the police will response and will start asking questions and get in the middle of all that. That doesn’t mean the police are racist, it’s the society who is racist.” In that incident, a white woman walking her dog in Central Park called the police because – she said – a black man who had been taking photos of birds was harassing her, when evidently he actually had been asking her to put her dog on its leash, as local ordinances require.

The Memphis native and Chinese Basketball Association star was arrested around 1 a.m. at the protests and faces three charges, including one for unlawful possession of a weapon. He was released on his own recognizance just hours later. A police affidavit said his arrest came as police were trying to clear Main Street.

The unprecedented work stoppage, promoted as #theshowmustbepaused on social media over the weekend, prompted industry figures from all sectors to speak out on behalf of racial justice during a weekend of demonstration nationwide. Nashville-based companies confirmed as participants include Concord Music, Compass Records, the Americana Music Association, the International Bluegrass Association, Thirty Tigers, Third Man Records, The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, Gibson Guitars and all the major record labels. The movement went viral while the country erupted in tumultuous protests of the on-camera asphyxiation of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, as well as a long litany of police killings of African Americans. The initial post, which seems to have launched on Friday, is rather vague in its motivations or prescriptions. “Due to recent events please join us as we take an urgent step of action to provoke accountability and change.” It calls on the industry to “disconnect from work and reconnect with our community.” Companies and industry figures quickly elaborated on the point of Blackout Tuesday. The AMA called for an end to systemic racism. “We further pledge to work actively against racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, and other oppressive notions that marginalize, restrict, or destroy any human being simply because of their identity. And moving forward, we commit to making a more concerted effort to push back against hate and to more proactively foster love and solidarity.” Rounder Records, one of the leading record companies in roots music and part of Concord Music, issued the following: “Rounder, its artists and employees condemn all acts of racism, violence, injustice, intolerance and cruelty. We believe in a better future and are committed to doing our part to achieve it.” The industry action swept up even bluegrass labels, whose history has leaned away from social action and activism. Mountain Home Music Company of Arden, NC for example posted a statement. “For too long, our Black brothers and sisters like George Floyd have borne the weight of police violence. We have an opportunity to make real change — for all of us,” the company said. “This is not a day off. Instead, this is a day to reflect and figure out ways to move forward in solidarity. We continue to stand with the black community, our staff, artists, and peers in the music industry.” “At this point, silence is more than complicity. Silence is killing our neighbors, friends, and fellow music lovers and creators,” wrote The Bluegrass Situation, which provides content to WMOT. “We stand in solidarity with Black, Indigenous, and folks of color protesting police brutality across this country and around the world.” In a detailed and personal statement, Sony/ATV chairman and CEO Jon Platt, the only black CEO of a major international music company, noted that June 1 was the launch of Black Music Month but wrestled with the historic context. “With racial strife rumbling across our country as I write this, I am struggling to reconcile the conflicting realities of the universal appreciation of Black music and the devaluation of Black life, George Floyd’s videotaped killing being the latest of recurring tragic examples.” A wider range of industry statements can be found in this Variety.com feature.

Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One — Derek Chauvin — has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits."" : 6/03/20 A previous version of this Web story incorrectly said all four police officers present at the death of George Floyd are white. Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. AILSA CHANG, HOST: The viral video that sparked nationwide protests this weekend captured an individual tragedy - the death of a black man at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. But George Floyd's death is set against a backdrop of economic inequality that has long shadowed race relations in this country. We're going to talk about that now for a few minutes with NPR's Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So we've been hearing an enormous amount of frustration in the last week about yet another black man dying in police custody. Can you just break down for us how economics plays into that frustration? HORSLEY: There is certainly frustration with the deadly tactics of police. But there's also frustration about the underlying circumstances that in the richest country on Earth, a man could lose his life because he's suspected of passing a counterfeit 20-dollar bill. We know that African Americans are worse off than whites in this country by almost every economic measure. Andre Perry, who studies race and inequality at the Brookings Institution, says that means blacks in general are more vulnerable to any kind of economic downturn. ANDRE PERRY: Black folk live in communities where a single economic shock can really send the entire economic hopes astray. HORSLEY: And, of course, right now, we're all living through a giant economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. CHANG: Right. HORSLEY: People throughout the country are on edge. And that has just added more dry kindling to the woodpile where this match has landed. CHANG: Well, about the pandemic - I mean, we know that African Americans have suffered disproportionate health problems during this entire outbreak. But economically, how are they faring, relatively speaking, during this time? HORSLEY: Not well. Of course, workers of all races have seen a spike in unemployment during the pandemic. The black unemployment rate has jumped into double digits, as have other rates. But the black-white gap hasn't gotten noticeably worse during the last couple of months. CHANG: Interesting. HORSLEY: We do know, however, African Americans who are working are more likely to be in essential frontline jobs. And that puts them at greater risk of infection. CHANG: So how does Minneapolis, where this all started, stack up when it comes to inequality or when it comes to discrimination? HORSLEY: The racial divide in Minneapolis is pretty stark both in terms of income and homeownership. In fact, the gap between white and black homeownership in Minneapolis is one of the largest in the country. And that matters because for a lot of families, owning a home is the main building block of wealth and stability. If blacks aren't able to buy homes, they're missing out on an important stepping stone. Nationwide, African Americans did make some gains in homeownership in the '90s and early 2000s. But those were really wiped out by the subprime mortgage crisis. And Andre Perry says that kind of structural inequality feeds into the frustration of the people who are protesting George Floyd's death. PERRY: That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters. It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities. HORSLEY: Now, Perry notes these demonstrations are taking place five months before a national election. And he says this is a good opportunity for policymakers to talk about how they see policing and how they would address these longstanding economic challenges. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

Most of them are now out of jail, but some of those protestors said things did not have to escalate like they did. One of the protestors arrested said he should’ve never been arrested in the first place. For the last five nights, people gathered to protest the death of George Floyd. Several people from different groups that took part in this weekend’s protests said the goal is to always keep things peaceful. While the initial marches were peaceful, hours later things turned violent. “Many who participated chose to branch off from the peaceful protest and began wreaking havoc in our city,” a post from Memphis Police said. Police arrested 31 people Sunday night on charges including disorderly conduct. Darin Abston Darin Abston Jr. was also charged this weekend. He had his first court appearance Monday. “I had to deal with a court situation from Saturday from the protest when I was wrongfully arrested, and a lot of my people were also brutalized with excessive force that was not necessary from the cops,” Abston said. Some video was released of Abston’s interaction with the police Saturday. He said things escalated to the point of officers in riot gear and on horses on Beale Street. “And when that happened, you had a rally together, not un-peaceful, completely peaceful,” Abston said. Police said they were responding to protesters who threw bottles and rocks at them. Local leaders and activists have expressed concern about the force used against another protestor arrested, Victoria Jones. “We’re not going to allow what happened to her to happen to anyone else,” Memphis NAACP President Van Turner said. “We’re going to make sure that she has able and capable representation. The NAACP is working now with Ms. Jones and some of the other protestors. We have to stand with these young people.” Memphis Police Director Michael Rallings said the department’s use of force policies are under review, which is something they do on a regular basis.",0.0

Protesters lingered in the Lafayette Square area well past the 7 p.m. citywide curfew. Several of the demonstrators were seen being taken into custody, waiting for further processing. By 9 p.m., there were reports of arrests happening throughout the city as some protesters started working their way back to the White House. The arrests and military show of force occurred in the hours after law enforcement officers used shields and tear gas to clear protesters from a park across the street from the White House as Trump prepared to make comments in the Rose Garden. His address came as hundreds of protesters surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington. The Department of Justice later issued a statement saying Trump directed Attorney General Wiliam Barr ""assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia."" The statement went on to say that several federal agencies, including the FBI, ATF and DEA, were coordinating to ""maximize federal security presence"" in DC.

At 6:44 p.m., Trump began his comments by pledging to be a ""law and order"" president as officers continued to push protesters blocks away from where he was standing, using some form of projectile. Trump announced his plan to ""mobilize"" federal resources to ""stop the rioting and looting."" He said the goal was to ""dominate the streets."" As Trump promised to stop the protests and specifically said the D.C. protests would be controlled, protesters nearby continued to be pushed back as law enforcement officials cleared the way for Trump to visit the nearby St. John's Church, where he stood holding a bible. Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU's National Security Project, said Trump's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act and dispatch the military to America's streets would be ""irresponsible and dangerous."" ""No level-headed governor is asking for an even more militarized response to civilian protests against police brutality and systemic racism — for good reason. There are already many reports of civilian police and some state National Guard forces engaging in serious abuses, and the deployment of military personnel, who are generally not trained for civilian law enforcement, only escalates the risks. This president must not cause the country and its people even more harm."" Monday's protests came after a weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city, where 88 people were arrested and dozens of law enforcement officers, including Secret Service agents, were injured. The smoldering aftermath resembled ugly scenes in cities across the country following Floyd's death.

Some were handing out water and others were selling masks that read ""I can't breathe,"" a reference to what Floyd was telling the arresting officers as he was dying. Lafayette Park, a primary protesting site through the weekend, was closed off Monday. Still, several hundreds of protesters gathered in the area to chant ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Don't shoot"" while facing officers guarding the park. Monday marks the fourth day that the White House has been the focal point of the protesters, prompting an increased response from law enforcement agencies.

Ratcliff said he was proud of the Bristol community for the peaceful protest held in town on Sunday. He said the department is trying to calm any fears of a protest turning dangerous. “And let them know that we’re there, and we’re going to protect them and the people that are doing the protesting. We’ve got a duty to protect them too,” he said. Captain Tim Davis with the Greeneville Police Department said they also support the public’s right to peacefully demonstrate. But Davis said concerned citizens have reached out to the department, worried about social media posts they’ve seen. “Members of the community have reached out over the Facebook posts, social media posts, saying there’s going to be some protest going on here,” said Davis. “Worried that we may have that same kind of spark go off here, the non-peaceful rallies.

Declaring himself ""the president of law and order,"" Trump said during a Rose Garden address that he is dispatching “thousands and thousands” of military personnel and law enforcement personnel to Washington, D.C., to stop rioting, looting, vandalism and destruction of property. Trump also urged governors to use as many National Guard troops as possible to control violence and warned if they didn't, he would deploy the U.S. military ""and quickly solve the problem for them."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protest,"" Trump said of the unrest. ""These are acts of domestic terror."" Immediately after his remarks, Trump walked across nearby Lafayette Park and visited St. John's Church, which was set on fire by protesters Sunday night. Trump held up a Bible in front of the boarded-up church, which is referred to as the ""church of presidents."" St. John's was built in 1815 and has been attended at least once by every president since James Madison. Trump's actions come after six days of protests and riots in cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died last week while in police custody. Police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Just minutes before Trump spoke in the Rose Garden and headed to St. John's, law enforcement officers cleared Lafayette Park with tear gas, rubber bullets, shields and horses. Though the Rose Garden was not within view of the protesters, reporters awaiting Trump’s speech reported hearing a series of loud booms. Critics suggested the decision to clear the park was linked to Trump's visit to the church. ""Were thousands of peaceful protestors just tear gassed so Trump could have a photo op?"" tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, a communications director for former President Barack Obama. Rabbi Jack Moline, president of Interfaith Alliance, also slammed Trump's visit to St. John's as a ""photo opp."" ""Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice – right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area – is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,"" he said. ""This only underscores the president’s complete lack of compassion for black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism."" Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump developed a plan to provide more federal help to cities dealing with the unrest during meetings with Attorney General William Barr, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley. ""There will be additional federal assets deployed across the nation,"" she said. ""There will be a central command center in conjunction with the state and local governments."" Trump is also considering invoking the Insurrection Act, an 1807 federal law that would allow him to deploy active-duty U.S. troops to respond to protests in cities. It was last invoked in 1992 for the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. Trump made the announcement hours after urging governors to accept federal help. The president told the state executives that most of them have been ""weak"" in failing to confront violent demonstrators. ""You have to dominate,"" he said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by CBS News. ""If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate."" McEnany later said the focus of the call ""was the National Guard, encouraging deployment far more than the 17,000 out there and utilizing them this evening certainly."" More:'Most of you are weak': Trump rails at the nation's governors, urges crackdown on violence More:'Nowhere to be found': Governors blast Trump after he tells them they are 'weak' on phone call Some governors criticized Trump's criticism, with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, describing his comments as ""deeply disturbing."" ""The president repeatedly and viciously attacked governors, who are doing everything they can to keep the peace while fighting a once-in-a-generation global pandemic,"" Whitmer said in a statement. “The president’s dangerous comments should be gravely concerning to all Americans, because they send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division.""",0.0

Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One — Derek Chauvin — has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits."" : 6/03/20 A previous version of this Web story incorrectly said all four police officers present at the death of George Floyd are white. Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. AILSA CHANG, HOST: The viral video that sparked nationwide protests this weekend captured an individual tragedy - the death of a black man at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. But George Floyd's death is set against a backdrop of economic inequality that has long shadowed race relations in this country. We're going to talk about that now for a few minutes with NPR's Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So we've been hearing an enormous amount of frustration in the last week about yet another black man dying in police custody. Can you just break down for us how economics plays into that frustration? HORSLEY: There is certainly frustration with the deadly tactics of police. But there's also frustration about the underlying circumstances that in the richest country on Earth, a man could lose his life because he's suspected of passing a counterfeit 20-dollar bill. We know that African Americans are worse off than whites in this country by almost every economic measure. Andre Perry, who studies race and inequality at the Brookings Institution, says that means blacks in general are more vulnerable to any kind of economic downturn. ANDRE PERRY: Black folk live in communities where a single economic shock can really send the entire economic hopes astray. HORSLEY: And, of course, right now, we're all living through a giant economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. CHANG: Right. HORSLEY: People throughout the country are on edge. And that has just added more dry kindling to the woodpile where this match has landed. CHANG: Well, about the pandemic - I mean, we know that African Americans have suffered disproportionate health problems during this entire outbreak. But economically, how are they faring, relatively speaking, during this time? HORSLEY: Not well. Of course, workers of all races have seen a spike in unemployment during the pandemic. The black unemployment rate has jumped into double digits, as have other rates. But the black-white gap hasn't gotten noticeably worse during the last couple of months. CHANG: Interesting. HORSLEY: We do know, however, African Americans who are working are more likely to be in essential frontline jobs. And that puts them at greater risk of infection. CHANG: So how does Minneapolis, where this all started, stack up when it comes to inequality or when it comes to discrimination? HORSLEY: The racial divide in Minneapolis is pretty stark both in terms of income and homeownership. In fact, the gap between white and black homeownership in Minneapolis is one of the largest in the country. And that matters because for a lot of families, owning a home is the main building block of wealth and stability. If blacks aren't able to buy homes, they're missing out on an important stepping stone. Nationwide, African Americans did make some gains in homeownership in the '90s and early 2000s. But those were really wiped out by the subprime mortgage crisis. And Andre Perry says that kind of structural inequality feeds into the frustration of the people who are protesting George Floyd's death. PERRY: That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters. It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities. HORSLEY: Now, Perry notes these demonstrations are taking place five months before a national election. And he says this is a good opportunity for policymakers to talk about how they see policing and how they would address these longstanding economic challenges. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

(WKRN) – The brother-in-law of Wesley Somers who is facing felony arson charges for setting fire to the Metro Courthouse says they intended to protest peacefully. “We went down there strictly for a peaceful protest and it turned violent and then it just, everything kind of just unraveled the way it did,” Jesse Clark told News 2. Several of Clark’s friends went downtown to take part in the ‘I Will Breathe’ rally, he says when violence overtook the message. “It was literally like it was out of a movie, it was absolutely insane.” Clark admitted that he broke windows of the courthouse. “Oh yeah, oh yeah I was definitely part of that, there’s several hundred other people [that were] part of it,” Clark said. Violence erupted, he said when police used unnecessary force. “Essentially, there was like multiple people fighting the police and that’s when things started getting crazy and they started lighting the courthouse on fire and things like that,” said Clark. He said Somers who is seen clearly in photos at the courthouse fire scene took part in the blaze, but Clark says that he shouldn’t take all the blame. “I don’t think he’s the one that should be getting the book thrown at him, because he’s not the one that started.” Clark said that Somers, who has a lengthy criminal record including domestic assault and drug charges, had turned his life around and that their actions were not organized. “He’s definitely not part of a white supremacist group. We went down there as individuals. He’s not getting paid, I see this stuff all over the internet. I know we was not part of that. It just turned violent and next thing I know we were in a crowd that was rioting. It just kind of happened. I don’t know what else to say about it, nothing was planned, nothing was organized, it wasn’t like we were going down there to hurt people.” Clark said their group of friends didn’t take part in vandalizing or looting any of the downtown businesses, but that he wouldn’t be surprised if he faces charges himself.

Detectives from the specialized investigations division took Tondrique Fitzgerald into custody Monday evening, according to a Twitter post from the Metro Nashville Police Department. Police said Fitzgerald is accused of pulling a granite plaque commemorating the civil rights movement in Nashville off the exterior of the courthouse. The plaque was smashed and the pieces were used to break the building's windows. Detectives from the specialized investigations division took Tondrique Fitzgerald into custody Monday evening in connection with damaged caused to the Metro Nashville courthouse. (Photo: Submitted photo) Fitzgerald is also accused of encouraging others to commit vandalism, police said. He is the second person to be arrested by Nashville police in connection to damage done to the courthouse, which serves as city hall. Police are continuing to search for individuals who they say hijacked a peaceful Saturday rally and caused violence and destruction. Officials have said they believe a small group of instigators infiltrated the ""I Will Breathe"" rally and march, which drew more than a thousand people to downtown Nashville. The demonstration — one of several happening across the country — was organized to protest police brutality and the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after an officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes. Protesters remained peaceful for hours before isolated bursts of violence and vandalism arose, first at the MNPD Central Precinct and then at the courthouse. Individuals threw rocks, smashed windows, pummeled police cruisers and damaged more than 30 buildings in the downtown corridor. The courthouse windows were smashed, its walls were spray painted with graffiti and fires were started inside the building, damaging a portion of the mayor's office.

Mr. Hagerty said, “President Trump has already taken decisive leadership in recognizing ANTIFA as a terrorist organization. America is rooted in the rule of law. We cannot have another night of violence. It has to stop now. Period. ""If we don’t, it propagates lawlessness. To better protect our cities and communities from further danger, President Trump should use the Insurrection Act to its fullest extent. Mobilizing our military forces across the country will show that we will not tolerate domestic terrorism.” Dr. Sethi said released the following statement on the violent riots in Nashville and across the country: ""I am deeply saddened and angered by the death of George Floyd. America has justifiably already started a conversation about real criminal justice reform. President Trump had already signed a landmark bill. That was a good start, and we must continue this work so these types of incidents finally end.But what we saw in that video was not representative of most police officers. I have cared for police officers who have put their bodies in front of bullets to protect us. I have seen their courage and devotion up close.Protests are inherently American. The right to petition for redress of grievances is a basic constitutional right. However, we cannot allow what these protests have morphed into to continue. We have moved far beyond peaceful protest into lawlessness. ""These ANTIFA-trained revolutionaries have no interest in a more perfect union. It's not about solving problems in policing to them, or helping heal neighborhoods. They want to bring down this country.CNN treats rioting like it is a legitimate form of protest. That’s wrong. There are liberal radicals trying to incite a civil war by inflaming racial tensions. These radicals are insurrectionists, and should be treated like it "".Nobody has the right to riot, to loot, to burn, to attack fellow citizens. Our leaders have a sworn duty to uphold the law, to protect our citizens, to put down insurrection. I am calling on them to do it now. ""What we saw this past weekend was political correctness run amok: cowardly Democrat Mayors, like John Cooper, are more concerned about political correctness and about what the liberal media thinks, than about protecting the people in our cities.This cannot be allowed to continue. Our leaders have a moral duty to protect our citizens’ life, liberty, and property. They must step up. I am calling on every Mayor and Governor in this country to use every means at their disposal if the lives, homes and businesses of Americans are threatened, and to stop the violent, ANTIFA-led mobs ripping through our cities. They will not quit otherwise. ""We cannot allow ANTIFA to tear America apart. We cannot allow them to burn our cities, to harm our people.We must pray for our country, and that our leaders will have the courage to protect America.This country is worth defending.

The group is one of two major organizers of protests in Memphis over the past several days. Al Lewis, a retired labor union president and second-generation activist, said the coalition would like to see better mental health resources for law enforcement as well as increased training in de-escalation and intervention skills. ""We understand the job they perform is highly stressful, and they see things most citizens would never even dream of seeing,"" said Al Mann. ""They are humans, but they are not superhumans, and we know that has an impact."" It's not just direct violence that officers are exposed to repeatedly, said Mann. He feels the officers are routinely exposed daily despair on calls to deeply impoverished and under-served areas. ""Even the domestic violence calls police have to respond to can really expose officers to depraved living conditions and horrible stuff,"" Lewis said. For their second demand, the coalition wants to see Memphis police officers receive more de-escalation and mediation training. The coalition said, as it stands, MPD officers receive too little training on effectively de-escalating conflict within their communities and more training on how to effectively communicate with citizens. MPD does have a Crisis Intervention Team, which is a specialized unit of more than 200 officers that have training for encounters with citizens suffering from complex mental health issues. Members of the CIT team are available in every police precinct, according to the city. The Commercial Appeal has reached out to MPD for clarification on how many hours are devoted to de-escalation training. MPD was not able to immediately return the inquiry late Monday afternoon. The coalition attempted to meet with MPD top brass in November 2018 at the NAACP's regional headquarters on Vance Avenue. That meeting ended unsuccessfully, Lewis said, when additional police officers showed up alongside MPD command staff, something Lewis said organizers were not expecting. ""They brought in extra security staff without notifying us, as if nine armed officers against seven unarmed activists wasn't enough,"" Lewis said. In spite of failed negotiation, Lewis said the coalition still wants MPD to consider their demands. The coalition has organized another call-to-action for Monday night and is encouraging citizens who want to protest the recent deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd to get in their cars and meet at the I-40 Hernando De Soto Bridge around 7 p.m. The coalition hopes that the event will be a peaceful demonstration that will amplify their demands and asks. Because, Lewis said, it's the system that must change, not just individual officers. ""I don't hate police officers, but I do hate the policing system,"" Lewis said.

Unlike previous nights, protests appeared to end without confrontation with law enforcement, despite a curfew that went into effect at 10 p.m. and a heavy police presence in downtown Memphis. Some divisions among some local activists appeared to be on the mend when two groups reconciled early in the evening, one led by pastor and activist DeVante Hill, who left Saturday night’s protest after other leaders seized control, and another led by activist Frank Gottie. “We’re gonna do this and we’re gonna do this together,” Hill said, to applause from others, including Gottie.

(Photo: Ariel Cobbert/The Commercial Appeal) The group honored George Floyd with eight minutes of silence as they marched past the FedEx Forum. They shouted Floyd’s name, along with the names of black men shot by law enforcement in Memphis: Martavious Banks and Brandon Webber. Webber was shot and killed by U.S. Marshals last year. When the group broke from marching, they spoke about unity. They urged support for more black-owned businesses while outside the Greater Memphis Chamber offices, criticized Memphis Light, Gas and Water for power cuts and encouraged voting for representative leadership. Calvin Simple, who marched with the group, said he marched because he wanted everyone to be free, to feel safe and so he, and other black men, wouldn’t be afraid to be stopped by police. “The only thing we’re looking for is for racism to end, of course, things like senseless killings like the George Floyd killing, things like that to stop,” he said. At around the same time, the second protest was occurring — organized by the Memphis Coalition of Concerned Citizens.

Some people raised fists out of their windows. In one instance, traffic was stalled until a Tennessee Highway Patrol vehicle drove up immediately behind a protester. State troopers had a heavy presence on the bridge, and officers had multiple ramps blocked on both the Tennessee and Arkansas sides of the river, also slowing traffic. While participating in the ""rolling bridge blockade,"" activist Hunter Demster was live streamed receiving a citation. In the video, an officer can be heard saying Demster was ""impeding traffic."" The group also targeted the I-55 bridge. Back in downtown Memphis, the group led by Hill split in two again toward the end of the evening. One group, still led by Hill, headed back toward the “I Am a Man Plaza,” where the evening began.

(Photo: Joe Rondone) Another group remained behind at 201 Poplar, considering remaining past curfew and bracing for a possible confrontation with law enforcement. Leaders in the group said they were waiting for the release of protesters whose bail they had paid. Eventually, hearing that jailed protesters would not be released until activists left, protesters were directed to head home. Stopping in the intersection of B.B. King and Beale Street, the group led by Hill took a moment to sit in the street and pray. “We’re out here right now … thanking you for Memphis right now, thanking you for the state of Tennessee right now, all these marches that are going on all over this country, black and white have come together like never before,” prayed the Rev. Charles Johnson, a Memphis pastor. “We thank you, God, for bringing us together.” Then, after walking the rest of the way back to the “I Am a Man Plaza,” that group also dispersed peacefully.

Germantown, a city just east of Memphis, released a statement disclosing the decision to impose a curfew Monday until 5 a.m. and follow with curfews on other nights. The statement says no civil unrest is expected on Germantown streets but the curfew is being issued ""out of an abundance of caution."" No other cities around Memphis appear to have taken similar measures. ""We actually discussed it after (Memphis) Mayor Strickland issued his order, but right now (West Memphis) Mayor (Marco) McClendon felt it wasn't a good idea right now without anything occurring in our city. It would send the wrong message. Right now everything is peaceful,'' city of West Memphis spokesman Nick Coulter said. In Memphis, Mayor Jim Strickland issued an order Monday that declares a civil emergency and imposes a citywide curfew. The measure follows peaceful protests that spilled over into violence Downtown on Saturday and Sunday nights. Memphis Police Director Mike Rallings reported 10 businesses and three police cars were vandalized during the two nights. Memphis residents have amassed near and in Downtown to speak out against nationwide police brutality, particularly the recent deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville. Thousands of people have protested in cities nationwide. In some cities, clashes, looting and fires occurred. In Germantown, officials announced the curfew in a public statement that says: ""Following the announcement made earlier by the City of Memphis, the City of Germantown is also instituting a 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, which will continue as long as necessary.

(WATE) — After days of demonstrations across the country in response to the death of George Floyd, local religious leaders are speaking out and calling for peace. Reverend Valentino McNeal, pastor of New Beginnings Christian Fellowship in Knoxville says the protests are a direct result of the anger, and sadness felt by black Americans across the country. “Protest is the cry of the unheard. They have not heard that black people and brown people and poor people need freedom. They need justice and they need equality,” McNeal said. Reverend Harold Middlebrook, a civil rights activist known for marching with the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., also speaking out, calling for peace. “I am urging our community, maintain nonviolence. I’m not saying that we have to be accommodating or that we have to be subservient. We must keep pressing for our rights and for justice. But we don’t have to tear up our own city,” Middlebrook said. Middlebrook also says he’s disappointed with the violent turn some of the demonstrations have taken. “Like all of the deaths, New York, Florida, Georgia, Louisville, all over the country, Texas, it troubles me. But what troubles me most is that there are those who are using the legitimate protests and grievances that we have to create a whole new different atmosphere,” Middlebrook said. Both leaders agreed that it is up to clergy to speak up and be the voice for the voiceless. “We should be out there leading, meeting with the government officials, the business people, the health care providers, all of those, the power brokers of this society,” McNeal said. “I think the clergy and I hope that not only the African American clergy, but those of the European American community will join in standing up and saying that what is going on is wrong,” Middlebrook said.

Declaring himself ""the president of law and order,"" Trump said during a Rose Garden address that he is dispatching “thousands and thousands” of military personnel and law enforcement personnel to Washington, D.C., to stop rioting, looting, vandalism and destruction of property. Trump also urged governors to use as many National Guard troops as possible to control violence and warned if they didn't, he would deploy the U.S. military ""and quickly solve the problem for them."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protest,"" Trump said of the unrest. ""These are acts of domestic terror."" Immediately after his remarks, Trump walked across nearby Lafayette Park and visited St. John's Church, which was set on fire by protesters Sunday night. Trump held up a Bible in front of the boarded-up church, which is referred to as the ""church of presidents."" St. John's was built in 1815 and has been attended at least once by every president since James Madison. Trump's actions come after six days of protests and riots in cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died last week while in police custody. Police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Just minutes before Trump spoke in the Rose Garden and headed to St. John's, law enforcement officers cleared Lafayette Park with tear gas, rubber bullets, shields and horses. Though the Rose Garden was not within view of the protesters, reporters awaiting Trump’s speech reported hearing a series of loud booms. Critics suggested the decision to clear the park was linked to Trump's visit to the church. ""Were thousands of peaceful protestors just tear gassed so Trump could have a photo op?"" tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, a communications director for former President Barack Obama. Rabbi Jack Moline, president of Interfaith Alliance, also slammed Trump's visit to St. John's as a ""photo opp."" ""Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice – right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area – is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,"" he said. ""This only underscores the president’s complete lack of compassion for black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism."" Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump developed a plan to provide more federal help to cities dealing with the unrest during meetings with Attorney General William Barr, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley. ""There will be additional federal assets deployed across the nation,"" she said. ""There will be a central command center in conjunction with the state and local governments."" Trump is also considering invoking the Insurrection Act, an 1807 federal law that would allow him to deploy active-duty U.S. troops to respond to protests in cities. It was last invoked in 1992 for the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. Trump made the announcement hours after urging governors to accept federal help. The president told the state executives that most of them have been ""weak"" in failing to confront violent demonstrators. ""You have to dominate,"" he said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by CBS News. ""If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate.""

Tensions grew from there, as dozens of protesters took a knee in the middle of the intersection between University Parkway and West State of Franklin Road. Protesters and police tried to negotiate a peaceful end, with the protestors asking that police officers take a knee with them in solidarity. Many of the demonstrators were upset that the Johnson City Police Department did not march with them Monday night, with JCPD Chief Karl Turner telling protestors they planned to march with them before the marchers left a vigil early. “That opportunity was taken from me,” Turner told one protestor. As police officers clad in riot gear inched forward, the demonstrators still in the street remained on their knees and raised their hands. A scuffle between protestors and police ensued as several arrests were made. At least three people were taken into custody. Demonstrators have been a mainstay in downtown since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis set off a wave of protests and riots across the country. Monday night’s protest was at least the fourth in Johnson City since Thursday, with others taking place in Bristol and Kingsport. Johnson City police officers stopped protestors from marching in the streets on Thursday, the first day of demonstrations. On Monday, however, the Johnson City police and the Tennessee Highway Patrol initially made no effort to stop the crowd, which numbered several hundred and marched well into the night. The march had remained peaceful throughout, with protest leaders urging everyone to remain peaceful. As things began winding down, one protestor went down the line of police blocking the roadway and hugged several officers. For the most part, the demonstrators had remained in downtown Johnson City, though they did block off University Parkway and West State of Franklin earlier that afternoon. As protests continued, police lined West Walnut Street, and tensions appeared to close to a boiling point with one demonstrator yelling at a police officer in riot gear, “This is exactly what we’re protesting against!” After they left the West Walnut Street area, they moved through an East Tennessee State University parking lot and started marching on West State of Franklin where they remained for more about an hour before police arrived. One protestor was almost struck by a car. Another demonstration is planned for tomorrow at 6 p.m. Turner told several protesters he would be there, and kept speaking with several demonstrators into the night. Reported earlier: Protesters shut down several downtown streets on Monday night, demanding justice and an end to police violence across the country. “No justice, no peace and we want peace,” said “Trayvon,” who declined to give his last name. “We’re tired of seeing our older black men and black women get killed by the police. We’re tired of this, we want justice, we want peace — the oppression is over, we’re coming to change this.” Demonstrators have been a mainstay in downtown since the police killing of George Floyd set off a wave of protests and riots across the country. In Johnson City, each march has ended at Johnson City Hall — and each has been peaceful. Monday night was the first time protestors had marched in the streets since Johnson City police officers stopped them from doing so on Thursday, the first day of demonstrations. On Monday, however, the Johnson City Police Department and Tennessee Highway Patrol initially made no effort to stop the crowd, which numbered several hundred and marched well into the night. Monday’s protest followed a prayer vigil that was attended by hundreds in Founders Park, many of whom marched shortly thereafter. As demonstrators marched through downtown, U.S. Rep. Phil Roe, R-1st, said he is “deeply upset” by the “wanton destruction” being caused during riots in other cities, and that he “strongly supports restoring the peace.” “Tonight, we should all pray for peace — peace for the family of George Floyd, peace in our communities and peace got those whose hearts are troubled by everything that has occurred over the past week,” Roe said. On Saturday, Johnson City community leaders, including the mayor and chief of police, spoke at a prayer and community unity gathering. Johnson City Mayor Jenny Brock said she believed the city would not resort to the violence seen elsewhere, adding that “we just need to listen to each other.” Johnson City Police Chief Karl Turner lambasted the officer who held Floyd with a knee to the back of the neck before he died, as well as the three other officers who stood by. “If you don’t have the courage to step in and stop something that’s wrong, you don’t need to be in law enforcement,” Turner said, also adding that the JCPD would not stop the protests so long as they remained peaceful. “We take an oath to uphold the constitution and they are exercising their constitutional right to assemble and have a voice and for that voice to be heard,” Turner said. One protester who was present on Saturday and helped lead the march on Monday, Alyjah Gilmer, said it was important for the police to see their message, not just hear it. When asked what he wanted to see changed, Gilmer said he’d like to see police departments train officers more in deescalation tactics, and “just turn in their badge if they’re going to racially profile.” “Hire the right people, you know what I mean?” Gilmer told the Press on Saturday. “And that goes for the chain of command also — if you have a big boss that’s corrupt, the entire chain is going to be corrupt. If you hire people that have their heart and mind in the right spot, that want to protect and serve rather than harass — I would love to see it.”",0.0

They did. Jones and other demonstrators had gathered for a vigil at the steps of the Capitol building in Nashville on Monday evening as protests against police brutality and racism continued around the country. The vigil took place as the Tennessee General Assembly reconvened at the Capitol after suspending this year's session in March due to the coronavirus. Several Democrats had walked down to join the demonstrators while their party colleagues and Republicans watched from the Capitol balcony. Jones has led protests in Nashville for years, including at the Capitol. Hundreds gathered at the Legislative Plaza across from the Capitol to mourn the lives of black men and women killed by police. The crowd sang, prayed and chanted together before moving their group to the steps of the Capitol while they sang ""This Little Light of Mine."" Protesting is a family affair Lacrisha Johnson, 31, attended the vigil with her 5-year-old daughter, Kingsley. ""I have to plant the foundation for her young,"" Johnson said. ""She can see solidarity. She can see things being peaceful."" Johnson's daughter was born in 2015, months after 12-year-old Tamir Rice was killed by police in Ohio and the same year Freddie Gray was killed in Baltimore. Raising a biracial child while the killings saturated public conversation has been emotionally startling, especially as Johnson started explaining race, privilege and police violence to her daughter. ""It's extremely hard,"" she said. ""Not only was I still learning myself, I now had to articulate that for her to understand."" Part of teaching her daughter is using intentional language. ""We're out here because a man was murdered,"" Johnson said. ""I don't use the word killed. I use the word murdered. You kill a fly."" Z Hall, 30, who is from Memphis and has lived in Nashville for the last decade, said she felt called to attend the vigil because she comes from a line of protesters that stretches back to her great-grandfather and the Civil Rights Era. Generations of family members have fought for their rights to be expanded, and the tradition continues on with her. Although she doesn't have children, her friends do. She has nephews and younger family members. Watching them grow is a beautiful experience, she said, but a fear swells inside her. She's worried they could become victims of police violence. ""We lost our fathers, our grandfathers, our uncles,"" she said. ""I'm not willing to lose our children. ""It's terrifying. What do I do?"" Saturday's protest Two days before, the Legislative Plaza was the site of the ""I Will Breathe"" rally to protest the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck, and other victims of police violence. The rally was peaceful, although vandalism and altercations with police by individuals after the event led to the deployment of the National Guard and a curfew order in Nashville, which remained in effect starting at 10 p.m. Monday. Trey Gibson, 20, attended Monday night's vigil and Saturday night's protest — the first time he's attended a demonstration. He was drawn to recent protests in Nashville to speak out against police violence. He said this is the first time such protests have been organized in the area since he's become an adult and politically active. Gibson said Saturday's crowd held more anger than the vigil. Monday's gathering was about healing, and it had a clear, guided purpose, he said. Although the crowd cheered when members of the National Guard put down their shields, Gibson had a different reaction: it was a meaningful gesture, but what about accountability and action? ""I feel like it's symbolic,"" he said. ""It looks good, but I'm not buying it. I need to see something concrete. ""I'd say the majority of the police want to do good. It doesn't matter how many good cops there are if the 95% don't hold the 5% accountable."" Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump urged governors around the nation to use as many National Guard troops as possible to control the ongoing protests and threatened to deploy the U.S. military to ""solve the problem for them"" if they did not. Gibson, who is black, said he has been questioned by white people as to why he's in their neighborhoods. He said a white woman reported him to law enforcement when he was recently visiting a family member in South Nashville. The police treat young adults differently based on their schools, he said. Gibson attends Tennessee State University, a historically black university, and said their parties and gatherings are treated differently by law enforcement than what attendees of non-HBCUs experience when they host an event. Gibson encouraged white people to use their privilege and voices to enact change: show up, listen and call out injustices. ""No one can change it by themselves,"" he said. Hall agreed that white men and women should use their voices to amplify those belonging to people of color. ""We need white people,"" Hall said. ""You have to put your job on the line. Your livelihood on the line. Your body on the line."" It can be hard to hold friends and family accountable, Hall said, but it has to happen in order to enact change. Have those hard conversations and call out racism. ""If this is a revolution,"" she said, ""it has to be a revolution.""

Trump’s bellicose rhetoric and the aggressive, orchestrated actions came as the nation braced for another round of violence at a time when the country is already buckling because of the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and the Minneapolis death of George Floyd. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. The demonstrators in Lafayette Park were cleared so that after his brief statement, Trump could walk across the park to St. John’s Episcopal Church, known as “The Church of the Presidents,” which suffered fire damage in one of the protests. Holding a Bible, he then stood with several of his Cabinet members as the cameras clicked. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” “It’s all just a reality TV show for this president,” he said on Twitter. “Shameful.” The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, police fired tear gas at hundreds of protesters who spilled onto an interstate highway in the heart of Philadelphia just before a 6 p.m. curfew took effect. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” In Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said she won’t send in National Guard troops to help quell violent protests in Portland because they aren’t needed and “having soldiers on the streets of America is exactly what President Trump wants.” At a news conference earlier Monday, Brown said she would send in 100 state police from across Oregon to assist the city, and activate 50 Guard soldiers to work behind the scenes. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” the Democrat said. In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd’s brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to stop the violence and use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. That distinguishes it from the official autopsy, which said he died from the effects of being restrained along with underlying health problems and potential intoxicants in his system. The official autopsy found nothing “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” The second autopsy was done by a doctor who also examined the body of Eric Garner, a New York man who died in an officer’s chokehold six years ago. The family has accepted an offer from former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather to pay for Floyd’s funeral and memorial services, according to the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man, Matthew Lee Rupert, saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. The video also showed him attempting to light a business on fire, and looting, according to an FBI affidivit. Early Sunday, he posted more videos of himself in and around Chicago, saying “let’s start a riot.” He was arrested in Chicago for violating the city’s curfew. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis. While police in places tried to ease tensions by kneeling or marching in solidarity with the demonstrators, officers around the country were accused of treating protesters with the same kind of heavy-handed tactics that contributed to the unrest in the first place. Cities struggled to keep police in line. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an officer was suspended for pushing a kneeling woman to the ground during a protest. In Atlanta, two officers were fired after bashing in the window of a car and using a stun gun on the occupants. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters, knocking two people to the ground. In New York, the police commissioner said about six incidents were being investigated by the department’s internal affairs bureau, including a weekend confrontation in Brooklyn in which two police vehicles appeared to plow through a group of protesters. In another incident, an officer pointed a gun at protesters, drawing condemnation from the mayor.",0.0

The curfew, Strickland and Rallings said, followed the largest night of arrests since protests began in earnest on Wednesday. The protests have been spurred by the recent killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. Floyd's death, in particular, ignited protests nationwide after a civilian filmed former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for several minutes. Floyd, who repeatedly said he couldn't breathe, was pronounced dead after the confrontation on Memorial Day. Rallings, along with top law enforcement officials across the country, has denounced the actions of Chauvin and the four officers who stood and watched, but failed to act. In total, 31 people were arrested as events unfolded over several hours in Downtown and South Memphis. One of whom is a former Grizzlies player and Memphis high school standout. Nearly all of the individuals arrested are facing one or more misdemeanor charges. The most common charges are obstruction of a highway or passageway, and resisting arrest. Two of the individuals charged are minors. The names of minors are not released in public documents. More than 40 individuals have been arrested since protests started last week.

Amid racial unrest across the nation, President Donald Trump on Monday declared himself ""the president of law and order"" and threatened to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the White House's idyllic Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Those peaceful demonstrators were cleared so Trump could walk across the park to St. John's Episcopal Church, known as ""The Church of the Presidents,"" which suffered fire damage in a protest this week. Holding a Bible, he then stood with several of his Cabinet members as the cameras clicked. ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" Trump declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" Trump said he would mobilize ""thousands and thousands"" of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park. The escalation came just after Attorney General William Barr came to the park to to survey the demonstrators. According to senior defense officials, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were being sent to Washington to provide assistance. Those troops were either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people. In extreme cases, however, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, also from the Civil War, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement. The officials said that some of the National Guard in D.C. will be armed and others will not. They said that the D.C. guard members do not have non-lethal weapons. The military police that are visible in the city are members of the Guard. ——————- THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's original story is below. —————————————— President Donald Trump on Monday derided many governors as ""weak"" and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations in the aftermath of violent protests in dozens of American cities. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference that also included law enforcement and national security officials, telling the state leaders they ""have to get much tougher."" ""Most of you are weak,"" Trump said. ""You have to arrest people."" The days of protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations turned violent in several cities, with people trashing stores, smashing and burning police cars and igniting fires in historic Lafayette Park across from the White House. Accused by critics of doing too little to defuse the crisis, Trump was to address the nation early Monday evening. The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again,"" said Trump. ""We're doing it in Washington, D.C. We're going to do something that people haven't seen before."" The president told the governors they were making themselves ""look like fools"" for not calling up more of the National Guard as a show for force on city streets. Attorney General Bill Barr, who was also on the call, told governors that a joint terrorist task force would be used to track agitators and urged local officials to ""dominate"" the streets and control, not react to crowds. He urged the governors to ""go after troublemakers."" Trump's angry exhortations at the nation's governors came after a Sunday night of escalating violence, images of fires and looting and clashes with police filling the nation's airwaves and overshadowing the largely peaceful protests. The protests had grown so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground bunker previously used during terrorist attacks. On Monday, Trump also spoke of trying to criminalize flag-burning. The Supreme Court has conservative new members since it last ruled on that issue, and Trump said that ""I think it's time to review that again."" He continued his effort to project strength, using inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks. As cities have burned night after night and images of violence have dominated television coverage, Trump's advisers have discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president's own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity. Trump did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to on Monday either. The demonstrations in Washington appeared to catch officers by surprise. They sparked one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service. Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening. Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force. ""This isn't going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,"" Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president. In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. The Justice Department deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",0.0

No end date was given. The curfew restriction, Strickland said, will persist “as long as is necessary.” Sunday was the fifth day of downtown-centered protests in Memphis and the most active for the Memphis Police Department and the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office. On Monday activists kept the protests going, with one element employing drive-slow tactics to affect traffic flow on a bridge into Arkansas. In Memphis and many cities across the nation, rage and disgust continue to percolate after video captured an officer in Minneapolis, Minn. applying a knee to 46-year-old George Floyd’s neck and sustaining that move while Floyd essentially pleaded for his life and died. A medical examiner on Monday classified Floyd’s death as a homicide. Officer Derek Chauvin and three of his associates have been fired, with Chauvin charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The other three officers have not been charged. Civil unrest has gripped the country at a level that has prompted comparisons to the social turbulence in the 1960’s, particularly 1968 – the year Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in Memphis. And it’s not just Floyd’s death. Police killed Breonna Taylor in her Louisville, Ky. home. Ahmaud Arberry was shot while jogging by armed white men claiming they thought he was a burglary suspect. Three people have been charged. Those killings are references point on a timeline that some say extends back to slavery and which is dotted by deaths in multiple other cities, including Memphis. Sunday’s protest in Memphis were peaceful at the outset. Late that night, things changed, with looting and property destruction reported in multiple locations and several arrests. During a special update announcing the curfew, Strickland thanked Memphis protesters “conducting themselves in a peaceful and powerful manner. … “I know that you are hurting and that you are angry and that you want change. I’m with you on that. …The needless death of George Floyd and too many other souls around our country serve as a constant reminder that we must do better.” Strickland said in recent days he has been in conversations with an array of people, including activists about ways Memphis can do better together. He noted strides made to improve police-community relations, adding there is more work to do. The curfew, he said, was a move to try to “keep things peaceful.” The vast majority of protesters want to get their message across in “a peaceful, powerful and respectful way.” However, a second group wants destruction and chaos. “We cannot let the second group steal the message to end systematic racism and take hope from the rest of us that love our city and want to bring meaningful and lasting change to a broken system,” he said. MPD Director Mike Rallings said the Tennessee National Guard was on hand Sunday to support the efforts of local law enforcement and likely would continue do so for the immediate future. Rallings, who spoke at Monday’s update, said he was an African-American man before he became a police officer, reiterated sympathy for George Floyd’s family and spoke again of ongoing respect for the right to protest. “But last night we saw things take a turn for the worse,” he said. “As a lifelong Memphian I am asking mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters to reach out to your loved ones and talk to them. “These acts of vandalism and violence, assaults on police officers cannot be tolerated.”",0.0

Look for updates on WJHL.com. Previous story: JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (WJHL) As protests across the nation continue in response to the death of George Floyd, the Tri-Cities area sees its fifth night of peaceful protests. Local African-American leaders told News Channel 11’s Pheben Kassahun what they hope happens and how to build on the justice they said is already in this community. A crowd gathered in Founders Park for a peaceful rally for justice, following the death of George Floyd, Monday afternoon. Organizers said the rally was sparked by the inaction of leaders across the nation. “The inaction of elected leaders to deal with serious public policy, the inaction of those with influence the critical conversations, in this case regarding race and descrimination. This long held history of inaction has led to a negative reaction,” Town of Jonesborough alderman, Adam Dickson told Kassahun. Local African-American community leaders said Johnson City is already heading in the right direction. “If we can sit down somehow and hear them say, ‘this is what’s in place for you, this is how we have your back’, I’ll be happy,” Johnson City Board of Education member, Michelle Treece said. Johnson City Board of Education member, Michelle Treece, said she wants local leaders to walk hand-in-hand in the fight for justice. “There were a lot of folks, some elected officials were there, some ministers and I was glad that happened. It was a prayer vigil,” Treece said. “As that was wrapping up, they were a group that were walking in, ‘protesters’ so-to-speak or those that were in solidarity, and I wanted to see the folks up on the steps, the elected officials, ministers in the area, the leaders, I really wanted them to come off those steps and join this group and just be there. They sang ‘lift every voice and sing’ and I wanted them to sing that. I stayed, and they may have stayed, and I didn’t see them but I saw a lot leave. Because that’s what the community needs to see that you’re with us and you see us.” Treece said Johnson City does not have the same issues as Minnesota, and she hopes the protests spark a discussion for local officials. Treece said, “Do our officers have training on this kind of thing, if and ever we needed it? Are they trained? What kind of provision is made for people of color in this town to make sure they’re fully part of this community.” SEE ALSO: Local police departments on guard in case protests escalate Treece added, “I think we have a community that is aware of what’s going on in our nation. We have small pockets of folks that those same national events impact here. Not at all at the same level, but we have folks who are aware of that, and I think when the community gets together and has a protest or vigil or stands in solidarity, I think it’s a way of saying, ‘We see you, we hear you and we want you to know that we support you.'” Good Samaritan Ministrieis CEO, Aaron Murphy, agrees. “There needs to be more conversations, there needs to be more sit-down meetings, there needs to be more. It hadn’t even been 60 years since there was segregation here,” Aaron Murphy said. Adam Dickson said he is grateful for how peaceful the protests have been. “I’m very grateful to see interacial cooperation and harmony. Folks wanting to come together to build community. Folks wanting to come together to say that they understand,” Dickson said. He hopes the community can build on this. “Talk about such things as providing opportunities for the community to speak so that we can listen. How do we promote healing, how do we promote a new generation of servant leaders,” Town of Jonesborough alderman Adam Dickson said. Treece also warned about people with alterior motives when peaceful protesters are taking place. “I think people come in and want to cause some destruction. We’ve had things and vigils in Founder’s Park in the past and nice things are going on and all of a sudden, you have a group who has nothing to do with this particular event, come in and want to start calling names and waving different flags and things like that,” Treece said. Local NAACP chapter President Jean Neal, released a statement about the Tri-Cities protests stating: “We are calling for the arrest and conviction of officer Derek Chauvin as well as the other three officers. We are saying Enough is Enough. We must keep our focus on redressing the systemic racism against out communities that led to this tragedy. We are requesting that everyone get out and vote and fill out Census Report. Join the local NAACP to help bring about a change. It is time for action instead of talk. Thank You.” Jean Neal President Johnson City/Washington County NAACP SEE ALSO: Family autopsy: Floyd asphyxiated by sustained pressure",0.0

Thousands took to the streets of Nashville on Saturday — one of many protests, peaceful or otherwise, nationwide — following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck despite Floyd’s cries that he could not breathe. Chauvin and three other officers involved in the incident were quickly fired after video footage surfaced, and Chauvin was arrested Friday. Following a peaceful “I Will Breathe” rally in Nashville, people shattered windows, graffitied buildings and set a fire at the Metro courthouse. Two men have been charged with felonies in connection with Saturday's events. Wesley Somers, 25, is facing charges of aggravated arson and disorderly conduct in connection with fires set at the Metro courthouse. Tondrique Fitzgerald, 23, is accused of pulling a granite plaque commemorating the civil rights movement in Nashville off the exterior of the courthouse. At least 28 others faced misdemeanor charges. One — a 17-year-old girl — was charged with breaking a 10 p.m. curfew set by Tennessee officials. Though the teen wasn’t the only one arrested after the imposed curfew, most others were accused of disorderly conduct and other charges. Twenty-one faced disorderly conduct charges after Saturday night’s protests, accused of screaming, throwing objects and obstructing traffic, according to affidavits filed in Davidson County. Police said some refused to leave when fires were started at properties along or near Broadway. A 20-year-old man was charged with disorderly conduct and possession of a handgun around 11 p.m. at the Capitol. Officers found the loaded .45 caliber handgun in the man’s waistband, and the man also had five loaded magazines, the Davidson County affidavit states. An Arlington, Texas man was accused of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest on Korean Veterans Boulevard at around 7:15 p.m. Though the majority of the 28 arrested were from Nashville or other nearby cities in Middle Tennessee, out-of-state travelers arrived from Texas, Illinois and New York. Three Nashville men were charged with assaulting an officer, two on Korean Veterans Boulevard about a half hour apart and another on Deadrick Street shortly after 11 p.m. MNPD said no officers were harmed during the protest, although some were pelted with rocks. In one instance, the man, “approached the officer and punched him with a balled up fist in the victim’s jaw,” according to the affidavit filed in Davidson County. Then, the man “yanked” the officer’s $300 watch, “breaking it and rendering it useless.” In another instance, a man is accused of throwing ""an unknown object” at two Metro Nashville Police Department bicycle officers. He fled on foot, resisting arrest once stopped, the affidavit states. A 25-year-old Hermitage man was charged with criminal trespassing at the Capitol. A Nashville man was charged with burglary on Broadway — two hats from Boot Barn, with price tags still on them. Another was charged with public intoxication on Broadway around midnight. Most of the arrests, 23, were of men, ages 21 to 61. Five women, ages 17 to 28, were charged. Of those arrested, police say 16 people are black, 11 are white and one is Hispanic. Organizers of Saturday afternoon’s peaceful “I Will Breathe” demonstration have since condemned the violence. Officials continued implementing curfews, for 8 p.m. Sunday and 10 p.m. Monday night.

Together, thousands of Americans spoke out against this injustice and sought to make their voices heard through peaceful, lawful protest. Then, what should have been a solemn moment of national reflection was upended by some of the worst elements of society. Here is what President Trump just told the Nation: My Administration is fully committed that for George and his family, justice will be served. He will not have died in vain. But we cannot allow the righteous cries of peaceful protesters to be drowned out by an angry mob. Innocent people of have been savagely beaten, like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street. Or the woman in upstate New York, viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed. New York’s Finest have been hit in the face with bricks. Brave nurses, who have battled the virus, are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct station has been overrun. Here in the nation’s capital, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War Two Memorial have been vandalized. One of our most historic churches was set ablaze. A federal officer in California, an African-American enforcement hero, was shot and killed. These are not acts of peaceful protest. These are acts of domestic terror. Violence against any American will never be tolerated. Tonight, President Trump announced executive actions to stop the rioting and restore safety to our cities.  First, he recommended every Governor deploy the National Guard and establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or state refuses to take action, then the U.S. Military will be deployed.  The President also announced decisive action to protect Washington, D.C., and our cherished national monuments. “As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults, and the wanton destruction of property.”  Every rioter and instigator will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Organizers of violence and terror will face lengthy and severe criminal penalties.  “I take these actions today with firm resolve, and with a true and passionate love for our country. By far our greatest days lie ahead.”  Watch President Trump’s full address.  Press Secretary: “Violence, looting, anarchy, lawlessness are not to be tolerated.” Related Stories Sections Topics",0.0

(WATE) — People in Knoxville peacefully came together downtown on Monday night, calling for justice. The group of hundreds started their peaceful protest in Krutch Park, taking a knee and singing “Amazing Grace,” before several speakers addressed the crowd. “Justice for George Floyd. Justice for Breonna Taylor. Justice for Atatiana Jefferson, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, and anybody and everybody who is a black man, woman and child who have been brutalized by an unjust system,” one speaker said. “I am tired. Enough is enough. When will enough be enough,” said another. Many attending had signs in hand, and told WATE 6 On Your Side the messages they’re hoping to spread. “It’s not a black-versus-white matter, it’s a wrong-versus-right matter,” said Danica Kim. “I’m out here to protect my black neighbors, my black family and just America.” “Justice for George Floyd, because the cop who was on his neck only got third degree murder, that isn’t enough. The other cops, all they got was fired. That’s the first thing. I want all of them to be held accountable because they are guilty by association,” said another attendee. “The unrest that’s in the country, there’s a cause for that. And until we focus on the cause and not the effect, this will not end,” said Imani Mfalme. The crowd then marching, walking through downtown Knoxville, eventually stopping and kneeling on North Gay Street. “After this protest today, it’s not over. We can’t have this protest and just go home and do nothing,” one speaker told the group. “We have to demand change, and it has to be collective change,” Mfalme said.

Now police say they've arrested that man. The Metro Nashville Police Department announced the arrest of 25-year-old Wesley Somers at a home in Madison and charged him with felony arson, vandalism and disorderly conduct. They said ""assistance from the community helped lead to his identification."" Somers is being held on $500,000 bond $755,000 bond according to Metro Police Chief Steve Anderson, who appeared at a Monday morning press briefing with Mayor John Cooper. (As Jason Steen notes on Twitter, Officer Andrew Delke was held on a $25,000 bond after he was charged with first-degree murder for fatally shooting Daniel Hambrick.) Somers is one of 29 people who were arrested over the weekend after a small riot followed a peaceful rally against police brutality, which drew thousands of people to the Legislative Plaza. Protesters confronted police at MNPD's Central Precinct, and as night fell, a smaller group of people spray-painted the front of the courthouse, shattered windows and started small fires inside. Police in riot gear fired tear gas at the crowd, filling Public Square Park with smoke and noxious fumes. Of the people arrested Saturday night, 16 were black, 11 were white and one was Hispanic. All but a few were from Middle Tennessee, and the majority were from Davidson County, according to police. Leaders of The Equity Alliance, one of Nashville's most prominent black advocacy organizations which helped organize Saturday's rally, condemned the rioting in a statement on Saturday night. “It is our firm belief that those individuals defacing and destroying public property after the rally were not a part of the original event,"" Charlane Oliver and Tequila Johnson said in the joint statement.

The curfew goes into effect at 10 p.m. Monday, Cooper said during a press conference Monday morning. Previous curfews on Saturday and Sunday applied only to the Urban Services District, which includes most of the center of the county. The curfew does not apply to medical personnel performing their duties or others granted exemptions by police leadership, and it expires at 6 a.m. Tuesday. The third night of restrictions comes after what Metro Police Chief Steve Anderson called a “peaceful” Sunday. Police leadership is monitoring possible protests later this week.  A large group of protestors gathered Saturday afternoon in front of the state Capitol for a peaceful rally that included remarks from activists and elected officials, including Cooper. Some of the attendees split off and marched through downtown to Metro Police’s Central Precinct, where protestors inflicted damage on the police building and vehicles, and police personnel detained several people. Another group congregated at the Metro Courthouse Saturday night, where a group threw rocks at windows, spray-painted walls and lit ground-floor offices on fire. Police dispersed the crowd with tear gas and arrests. On Sunday, MNPD personnel arrested a Madison man they say was responsible for some of the fires.  “We will find those involved in these criminal acts and prosecute them,” Cooper said. Organizers of the original event, which was meant to protest the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, distanced themselves from the damage inflicted later in the day. “It is our firm belief that those individuals defacing and destroying public property after the rally were not a part of the original event,"" Equity Alliance leaders Charlane Oliver and Tequila Johnson said in a joint statement.

It's pretty easy to explain, though: Local Fox 17 anchor Stacy Case drew a baseless connection between the rioting in Nashville Saturday night and Antifa, the favorite boogeyman of right-wingers everywhere. It went downhill from there. Thousands of people gathered on Legislative Plaza on Saturday for a peaceful rally in honor of George Floyd — the black man who was killed by Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes — and in opposition to police brutality against African Americans. But later on Saturday night, a few dozen people who remained in the downtown area vandalized the Metro Courthouse, broke windows and started small fires. Police had arrested 29 people as of Monday morning. On Sunday afternoon, President Donald Trump — who has encouraged police violence against protesters on his Twitter feed — tweeted the following: ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" Antifa, short for antifascist, is a thing people have spray-painted on things during previous protests and, indeed, some destructive riots. But it is not An Organization, and anyway, the president does not currently have the legal authority to declare a domestic group as a terrorist organization. Enter Stacy. Whether you like the Pres. or not, whether you’re Dem. or Rep. or somewhere in between, this designation of #Antifah says all we need to know about what happened in #Nashville last night after a peaceful rally. Terrorism & violence has to be exposed & dug up by its roots. https://t.co/hJErrz6jvh — Stacy Case (@StacyCase_) May 31, 2020 On the contrary, the president's confused social media outbursts do not tell us ""all we need to know about what happened in Nashville."" It's hard to sort out the exact motivations of everyone involved in these sorts of incidents. It's clear that thousands of people were interested in having a peaceful rally to protest police violence. A very small group of people wanted to break stuff. We don't yet know, and may never know, what precise motivations each of those people had. We can be pretty sure, however, that Antifah (sic) did not send them to the courthouse. But that's actually not the end of this bizarre episode. When Tennessean reporter Natalie Allison — who was right in the thick of things Saturday night and has covered many protests of all kinds — pointed out that Case's tweet had no basis in fact, things got even weirder. Reporting developments as they happen. Do you live in Nashville? Have you built a business here? Have you raised a family here? Do you condone the destruction of this beautiful city? Is that okay with you ? — Stacy Case (@StacyCase_) June 1, 2020 Taking those questions: irrelevant (although, we'd later learn that Case actually lives in the heart of Brentwood, not Nashville); irrelevant; very irrelevant; no, but also the ""beautiful city"" was not destroyed; no and also kind of irrelevant to the discussion at hand. There's too much to choose from here, but a few more things to highlight: Case would later trumpet Metro Councilmember Robert Swope's email claiming to have identified a local Antifa leader, apparently not realizing that others were sharing it as an example of utter lunacy. She capped off her tirade against Allison with this wild tweet: Y’all Natalie’s trying to get her ‘clicks’for the week. Everybody in media is required to get a certain number of clicks on their social media account. ✅ So, she instigated a Twitter war w/ me today to fulfill her work requirement. Help a girl out. — Stacy Case (@StacyCase_) June 1, 2020 To clarify: Scene reporters are not required to ""get a certain number of clicks on their social media accounts,"" although we highly encourage you to click on our posts. Lastly, Case repeatedly criticized The Tennessee Holler for not posting surveillance photos of rioters and ""trying to help find them so we can bring them to justice."" Local television news stations around the country are institutionally confused on this point, but the media is not actually supposed to exist as an arm of law enforcement. Journalists in Nashville covered the peaceful protests, as well as the destructive acts that came later, because they were newsworthy. They are there to report on how the police behave just as much as how citizens act. Local media outlets should act independently of the police department, not behave as bulletin boards for wanted signs. Stacy Case should take a walk, then a nap.",0.0

Hundreds of people on Sunday gathered at the town square, where many businesses had boarded up their windows. About two hours into the protest, a group of more than 100 protesters broke off from the contained demonstration and marched to the Murfreesboro Police Department headquarters, where they confronted a line of officers and asked for a dialogue on race, economics and criminal justice in America. The group then departed for nearby Middle Tennessee State University. Just outside of the university, the demonstrators blocked an intersection in protest. SWAT and special response teams from multiple agencies descended on the protesters, deploying tear gas and flash-bangs, causing unknown injuries to one man who was transported by ambulance to a local hospital. The group then continued to MTSU's campus, where they met outside of Forrest Hall — MTSU’s ROTC building, named for Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest. State troopers were waiting, but campus police engaged the protesters, who at that point numbered in the dozens. The authorities engaged in a dialogue with the crowd, shaking hands, taking photos together and helping the group to safely leave campus, as a curfew had been put into effect across town. Some protesters remained at the town square after curfew and were met with lines of riot police. One person was taken into custody after reportedly being stepped on by a mounted police horse. At some point in the day, at least one window at a local bar was broken in what appeared to be an isolated incident. See a video from Sunday's events here, with more photos below.",0.0

Jamila Thomas of Atlantic Records and Brianna Agyemang of the creative services firm Platoon have come up with a way for people involved in music to help: by being quiet for a day. Thomas and Agyemang have designated Tuesday, June 2, as Blackout Tuesday, a 24-hour period in which they're calling on the music business to shut down. The purpose is in part to protest police brutality specifically, but also to call attention to deep-rooted systemic racism. “Tuesday, June 2nd is meant to intentionally disrupt the work week,” reads a statement on the pair's website, theshowmustbepaused.com. “It is a day to take a beat for an honest, reflective and productive conversation about what actions we need to collectively take to support the Black community.” The purpose of involving the music business is to draw attention to the ways that this industry — which is a multi-billion-dollar business, even if very few musicians make huge incomes — owes so much to black musicians, from string bands to rock ’n' roll to dance music, hip-hop and beyond. Thomas and Agyemang envision this moment as the first step in holding the industry accountable for sharing the wealth and opening up opportunities. They expect to release a plan of action soon. Many record labels and other music-business entities have pledged to participate, and an array of publications have, too.

(WKRN) —- On Monday, hundreds joined forces for a peaceful protest at the Tennessee state capitol, voicing their anger with the death of George Floyd. Organizer and refugee, Kayo Beshir, told News 2 that their goal is to achieve change in peaceful way. He referenced the riots that took place in Nashville on Saturday night, as a distraction to the peaceful message that was shared during the ‘I will Breathe’ rally earlier on the same day. During Monday’s demonstration, the crowd sang hymnals, chanted and called for action against what they called, unjust policing. Some shared their Christian faith, asking for others of faith to support and advocate for change. “We recognize that Jesus’ death was both a sacrifice and a murder, and when you identify it as a murder we have a responsibility to be out here demanding justice for acts of cruelty and acts of violence.” said Russell Pointer Jr. a pastor. Activist and Reverend, Justin Jones said the turmoil won’t end until racist institutions are dismantled and new legislation protects against unjust policing. At one point during the event people walked in groups of two up to the state capitol. Some state representatives held up the barrier tape allowing protesters to pass through. Once at the top of the capitol, protestors asked the Tennessee National Guard to drop their shields and they did. The crowd exploded in cheers and someone said through a megaphone, “We want to thank our National Guard for being on the right side of history.” Jones called their actions, a divine occurrence, “it was a movement of faith for them to put down their swords and shields, because we came up here singing and we came up here prayerful. We are here to bring peace and change.” The latest on the protests after the “I Will Breathe” rally in Nashville:",0.0

We condemn all acts of racial violence. It is engrained in our culture and part of our ethos, and we are going to build on established initiatives in our community. With Memphis’s history as a backdrop, the Grizzlies have been the host and facilitator of some powerful discussions on the Intersection of Race and Sport in conjunction with the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day Celebration Game. In the coming days, we will be collating and posting videos from the most recent forums and symposiums at Grizzlies.com. Created in partnership with the National Civil Rights Museum, we hope making these meaningful sessions available will serve as a way to further educate and inform through the words and experiences of our Sports Legacy Award recipients and members of the NBA family. We will also will be working with the National Civil Rights Museum to facilitate and amplify conversations specific to this moment in time. We’ve been committed to the practice of mentorship since 2004, and in moments like these we want to create a safe environment where participants in our mentorship programs can have an open and honest dialogue with each other. As such, the Memphis Grizzlies and its community partners, including the Memphis Grizzlies Foundation, will in the days and weeks ahead coordinate a series of virtual sessions for our Mentors and Mentees to discuss recent events and their effects both here in Memphis and across the country. We looked internally to understand what additional ways we could support all members of our organization, and recognized that under our current time off policy, staff may have to make a financial sacrifice in order to exercise their right to vote. Knowing fundamentally that change happens at the ballot box, we’ve created a new category of Paid Time Off (PTO) to be used specifically in order to vote so that during local and national elections our staff will never have to make a decision between voting or incurring a financial loss. Finally, we will work with the National Basketball Coaches Association and support the initiatives they put forward in our community. -------------------------------------------------------- 12:10 a.m. - 12:05 a.m. - Boards have been put up on City Hall windows and barricades are being set up.

Saturday night, an estimated 500 people marched through Downtown Memphis, and tonight, a similar gathering is planned. Saturday night's demonstration began outside the National Civil Rights Museum. Hundreds of participants first marched to the Clayorn Temple's ""I AM A Man"" Plaza, which honors the 1968 Memphis sanitation strike. There the group read a list of demands, including ways to improve the relations between Memphians and the Memphis Police Department and local government. The demonstration also stopped to kneel at certain intersections for several minutes, to mark the length of time a now former Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on the neck of George Floyd before he died. The demonstration also went to the MLK Plaza, north on Second past 201 Ppolar and back to the National Civil Rights Museum on the Main Street pedestrian mall. The gathering wrapped around 9:30 p.m., peacefully and civilly. ------------------------------------------------ 5/31/2020 - 12:45 a.m. - About an hour after a peaceful demonstration through downtown Memphis Saturday night, people gathered at Main and Beale were met with a heavy MPD presence. There were dozens of officers dressed in protective gear along with a few officers on horses. There were tens of people gathered as they shouted at police. Police demanded people disperse, and said if they didn’t, they would be arrested. It's currently not known if anyone was arrested at the scene. After being asked to disperse, Local 24 News crews saw people run down Beale Street away from the police throwing barricades, garbage cans, and glass bottles. No stores were vandalized, but a police car parked at Beale and B.B. King Blvd. was damaged. Our crews also saw tear gas thrown, but do not know who threw it. Right now, it is also unknown what instigated the situation. MPD has officers in riot gear and has faced off with protesters along Beale Street in downtown, demanding people disperse.

Posted by Local Memphis on Saturday, May 30, 2020 --------------------------------------------------------- 6:15 p.m. - For the fourth consecutive night, Memphis area demonstrators are holding a gathering and making their voices heard after the death of George Floyd earlier this week by a now former Minneapolis Police officer. Saturday’s gathering is labeled “A peaceful call to protest” and is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m. outside the National Civil Rights Museum in downtown Memphis. An organizer told Local 24 News the overall goal of these demonstrations is to build a unified voice - with not only African Americans, but the LGBTQ community and other ethnicities - to improve relations between MPD and citizens it serves. That organizer added: “If we are in pain together, we will solve the problem together.” Local 24 News has learned the march will go to other locations across downtown. Friday night, the same organizer set up another demonstration in downtown Memphis which hundreds attended. Participants at times kneeled on Beale Street and outside the National Civil Rights Museum. Also Friday night, Memphis Police Director Mike Rallings posted a video to Memphians. Director Rallings sent out his condolences to Floyd’s family and questioned why the Minneapolis Police officers stood by as Floyd died following his arrest. Director Rallings asked demonstrators “not to take out their anger” on Memphis Police officers during a time of tension, violence, and rioting in other cities across the United States.",0.0

Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America” because the country needed “cooperation not contempt, security not anarchy, healing not hatred, justice not chaos.” “I am mobilizing all available, federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting and looting to end the destruction and arson and to protect the rights of law-abiding Americans,” he said in the White House Rose Garden. Trump spoke as protesters marched in the capital where riot police carrying shields pushed them back with tear gas and rubber bullets. The rioting in the US stems from protests over the death late last month in police custody of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man who had been detained in the midwestern city of Minneapolis for allegedly trying to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a supermarket. In videos recorded by passers-by, a white police officer who participated in the arrest – and is now facing third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges – is seen kneeling on the back of Floyd’s neck and ignoring the handcuffed man’s pleas for mercy. Trump said he had “strongly recommended” to every governor to deploy the national guard in sufficient numbers to dominate the streets until the violence has been quelled. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” he said. The head of the National Guard Office, General Joseph Lengyel, indicated on his Twitter account that as on Monday, “17,015 National Guard Soldiers and Airmen are assisting local and state civilian agencies responding to civil unrest”. Calling the violence in Washington DC last night “a total disgrace”, Trump said he was “dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement offices to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism assaults and the wanton destruction of property.” He said the government was putting everybody on warning that seven o’clock curfew will be strictly enforced. He vowed to arrest and prosecute those “who threatened innocent life and property”. “I want the organizers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail.” At the end of his speech, Trump said he would go to “pay my respects to a very, very special place”. Surrounded by dozens of security personnel, he then walked out of the White House across Lafayette Square to St. John’s Episcopal Church that was damaged in fire amid protests on Sunday. Trump posed for the cameras with a Bible in his hand in front of the windows of the church, whose basement caught fire, although no major damage was done. EFE-EPA lb-llb/ssk",0.0
1623009924,2020-06-02 04:46:04,Concern in Philippines over Duerte’s new anti-terrorism law,https://www.laprensalatina.com/concern-in-philippines-over-duertes-new-anti-terrorism-law/,en,False,"politics and government, law and legislation, medicine and health, international relations, diseases and conditions, viruses, freedom and human rights",287422,laprensalatina.com,http://laprensalatina.com/,"Manila, Jun 2 (efe-epa).- Human rights organizations in the Philippines have expressed their concern about the imminent approval in congress of a new anti-terrorism law, which they consider seeks to persecute government critics and punish both dissent and political activism. The International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines (ICHRP) warned that the law is “the last piece of the puzzle” that the Rodrigo Duterte government needs to impose a martial law, which it has threatened on several occasions. “We are appalled that the Philippine government is giving priority to repressive legislation but remains bungling in addressing the pandemic. We have seen too many deaths both from the virus and the violence President Duterte has unleashed against his people,” said ICHRP President Peter Murphy. The new anti-terrorism law was already approved in the Senate in February and the plenary session of the House of Representatives – dominated by the president’s allies – is expected to pass that version in the coming days, after Duterte certified on Monday as urgent the processing of that law. The proposed law would replace the current Human Security Law of 2007 and, among other modifications, expands the number of days that a terrorism suspect can be detained without an arrest warrant, from currently 3 days to 14 days, to which 10 more can be added. It also broadens the range of crimes that can be considered terrorism, such as “threat or incitement to commit terrorist acts,” punishable by 12 years in prison, a provision that according to legal experts seeks to punish political dissent, since any protest against the government could be classified as terrorism. “From its murderous war on drugs and a rabid counterinsurgency campaign to extending emergency executive powers, as well the numerous attacks on freedom of expression, the passage of draconian amendments to the Anti-Terrorism law will seal the deal in Duterte’s brutal campaign of State terrorism-the final piece in the regime’s bid to establish a full blown fascist dictatorship and de facto martial law,” said Karapatan, a national network of human rights organizations. The civilian population has also expressed disgust with the new rule and since last week – when two lower house committees gave the text the green light – the hashtag #JunkTerrorBill has been trending on several occasions in the Philippines. The Philippines has within its borders the threat of various insurgencies classified as terrorists: jihadist groups, related to the Islamic State, on the island of Mindanao; and to Asia’s oldest and deadliest communist guerilla, the New People’s Army (NEP), the military wing of the outlawed Communist Party. Duterte regards the NEP as the greatest threat to national security and has pledged to end them before the end of his term, tightening military offensives against his bases and suspending the peace dialogue. The president has also accused numerous human rights organizations and leftist groups of acting as “legal fronts” of the NEP, also targets of his verbal attacks, while there has been an increase in acts of violence, harassment and harassment against activists.

In recent years, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the face of the movement. In 2016, he began kneeling before games, during the playing of the national anthem, to protest police treatment of minorities and social inequality. Since last week's death of George Floyd, an African American man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck, there's been a surge of sports figures speaking out. Some have even joined demonstrations that have swept the nation. True to its status as the most politically progressive of this country's major sports, the NBA has had many players and officials lend their voices – from Commissioner Adam Silver to Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James to legendary Lakers center and longtime political activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who wrote about what he believes is the motivation behind the widespread protests. ""The black community is used to the institutional racism inherent in education, the justice system and jobs,"" Abdul-Jabbar said in a Los Angeles Times essay last weekend. ""And even though we do all the conventional things to raise public and political awareness ... the needle hardly budges."" He added, ""Yes, protests often are used as an excuse for some to take advantage, just as when fans celebrating a hometown sports team championship burn cars and destroy storefronts. I don't want to see stores looted or even buildings burn. But African Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you're choking on it — until you let the sun in."" Even Michael Jordan weighed in publicly, which to many was a surprise. The recent 10-part ESPN documentary, The Last Dance, lionized the legendary Chicago Bulls star, although it touched on a few perceived shortcomings, including what some see as Jordan's unwillingness to speak out on political issues. ""I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in,"" Jordan said in the documentary, adding, ""but I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player. ""I wasn't a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That's where my energy was."" But now Jordan is speaking out, an indication of how deeply Floyd's death has resonated. ""I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,"" Jordan said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough."" There have been other heartfelt, and perhaps surprising, shows of solidarity. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz also has been largely apolitical in his four years in the NFL. But last week, Wentz was one of the first prominent white athletes to speak out. ""Being from North Dakota, I've spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I'm never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through,"" Wentz said on Twitter. ""I'll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color. ... ""I don't understand the society we live in that doesn't value all human life. It's heartbreaking and disturbing. My prayers go out to every man, woman and child that has to endure the effects of the racism in our society."" Former and current African American teammates praised Wentz. ""You didn't have to say a thing but you did,"" former Eagles receiver Torrey Smith tweeted, adding, ""Love you bro."" Traditionally, Major League Baseball has, as a sport, avoided politics. Not now. A number of big leaguers have weighed in, including Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle. He's white, and he offered historical context in a tweet with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. ""Racism is America's Original Sin,"" Doolittle wrote. ""It was here before we even forged a nation, and has been passed down from generation to generation. And we still struggle to acknowledge that it even exists, much less atone for it. The generational trauma of racism and violence is killing black men and women before our eyes. ... ""We must not look away from the racism and violence. ... We must take action and call it out for what it is. We must recognize our shared humanity and atone for our Original Sin, or else we will continue to curse future generations with it. ""RIP George Floyd."" Still silence Even though the current environment seems to encourage sports figures to speak out, there's also notable silence coming from the sports world. So says LeVelle Moton. Moton is the men's basketball head coach at North Carolina Central University. He said white basketball and football coaches from the most prominent college conferences in the nation — the Power Five — are not speaking up. And he said he believes they should be. In fact, he said, they're obligated to do so. ""The reality is, a lot of these coaches have been able to create generational wealth,"" Moton told ESPN Radio. ""Their grandkids' kids are gonna be able to live a prosperous life because athletes who were the complexion of George Floyd were able to run a football, throw a football, shoot a basketball or whatever have you, so they have benefited greatly from athletes that look like George Floyd and many more. But whenever people the complexion of George Floyd are killed, assassinated, murdered in the street in broad daylight, they're silent."" Not all. Prominent white college basketball coaches have spoken out against Floyd's death, including the University of Kentucky's John Calipari, Roy Williams of the University of North Carolina and Michigan State University head coach Tom Izzo. Nick Saban is the most famous active head coach in Division 1 college football. He also released a statement about Floyd. ""We're at an important moment for our country,"" the University of Alabama coach said in a message that cited civil rights icons Rosa Parks and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., ""and now is the time for us to choose kindness, tolerance, understanding, empathy, and most importantly ... it's time to love each other. Every life is precious, and we must understand we have so many more things that unite us than divide us."" Still, the complexity of Kaepernick Sunday's Houston Chronicle sports section went beyond the myriad athlete and coach statements of grief and resolve. It took a strong stand with a full-page editorial statement. The page had a picture of Floyd at the top and a kneeling Kaepernick at the bottom. In between, a section read, ""Imagine, if we had embraced Colin Kaepernick's peaceful protest and paid attention to the issue he was trying to address."" It wasn't the only connector between Floyd and Kaepernick. A dramatic meme circulating since Floyd's death shows a picture of the Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, next to a picture of Kaepernick kneeling in protest. The visuals have stirred up the not-too-distant memory of Kaepernick's protest, which began in 2016, and was politicized from the beginning. And it's prompting harsh criticism of the NFL, even as the league joins the massive sports outpouring of grief and anger. Last weekend, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement offering condolences to Floyd's family as well as those of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, young African Americans also killed in recent high-profile cases. ""These tragedies inform the NFL's commitment and our ongoing efforts,"" Goodell said, adding, ""There remains an urgent need for action. We recognize the power of our platform in communities and as part of the fabric of American society. We embrace that responsibility and are committed to continuing the important work to address these systemic issues together with our players, clubs and partners."" Critics blasted Goodell for what they called hypocrisy. ""Colin Kaepernick asked the NFL to care about the lives of black people and they banned him from their platform,"" said Michael-Shawn Dugar, an NFL writer for The Athletic. Instead of prompting a discussion about police treatment of minorities and social inequality, Kaepernick's protests prompted a debate about patriotism and the flag, fueled by President Trump, who used an expletive to describe Kaepernick and other players who joined the pregame protests. Even though the NFL ultimately endorsed social justice initiatives, Kaepernick still is considered a pariah — no NFL owner has hired him. And with the league dealing with a significant lack of diversity in important head coaching and general manager positions, Goodell's critics said his reference to the league's ""commitment and our ongoing efforts"" is insincere. On their face, Goodell's words seemed in lockstep with much of the rest of the sports world as it grapples with and grieves over Floyd's death. But for many, the renewed attention on Kaepernick and his experience present just as powerful a message about the powerful NFL, where, in the volatile realm of race and justice, words appear louder than actions.

The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you; you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" ""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard."" ""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly."" Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal."" ""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way."" In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

1623099010,2020-06-02 06:08:00,What We're Reading About The Past Week Of Protests,https://www.wmot.org/post/what-were-reading-about-past-week-protests,en,False,"blacks, police, news and news media, demonstrations and riots, murders and attempted murders, police brutality and misconduct",310386,wmot.org,http://wmot.org/,"If you've been trying to keep up with news about the nationwide protests against police brutality, the stream of stories can be overwhelming. In the days following George Floyd's homicide at the hands of Minneapolis police, reporters have been covering the protests in more than 140 cities across the country, trying to make sense of this tumultuous moment. Here are some of the most illuminating stories that we've read this week to help us understand how we got here, and the larger issues driving the protests. Minneapolis in context This is hardly the first time that Minneapolis has erupted into protests about police brutality and the killings of black people. In 2016, people took to the streets after police shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in a nearby suburb, Falcon Heights. And in 2015, Minneapolis police shot and killed Jamar Clark, which ignited two weeks of protests. In The Boston Review, Elizabeth Stinton relates the current protests in Minneapolis to the ones that followed the deaths of Clark and Castile. She also looks at the nationwide unrest that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Similar to the uprisings that took place over half a century ago, she writes, Minneapolis residents are fed up with the ""buildup of unanswered grievances and the lack of concrete changes to their immediate living conditions."" ""Rather than responding to violent political rebellion with policy—such as addressing mass unemployment, failing public schools, and inhumane housing conditions—policymakers and officials, from Richard Nixon's War on Crime to the bipartisan War on Drugs to Donald Trump's embrace of 'Law and Order' politics, have consistently sought to manage the material consequences of socioeconomic problems (e.g., urban decay and drug abuse) with more police, more surveillance, and, eventually, more incarceration. We as a nation still fail to reckon with the wisdom King prophetically offered toward the end of his life: that only 'social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention. There is no other answer. Constructive social change will bring certain tranquility; evasions will merely encourage turmoil.'"" Policing Over at Slate, Joel Anderson writes that while many police chiefs are condemning the excessive use of force by the police officer who killed Floyd, it's important to pay attention to what police are doing during protests: ""The initial response of police leaders may have felt like progress, but video footage of police and protesters clashing in the streets reveals the truth: Officers are much closer to what we see in viral videos documenting their brutality than in the well-intentioned words of their leaders. Despite the shift in public statements, police haven't changed since the protests of 2014 and 2015."" Many protesters, including journalists, have captured police on tape pointing guns, shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at them. Michael Dessam compiled a list at Slate of the ways police incited violence: ""Police all over the country tear-gassed protesters, drove vehicles through crowds, opened fire with nonlethal rounds on journalists or people on their own property, and in at least one instance, pushed over an elderly man who was walking away with a cane."" Existing while black The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging during the protests, and as we've reported, black people are dying from the virus at disproportionate rates. And as Annelisa Merelli at Quartz writes, police brutality is also a public health crisis that affects black people at a much higher rate than others: ""To give a sense of the magnitude of the crisis, the APHA reported that in 2016 alone (the latest year for which the organization could get reliable data, in itself a telling sign of the lack of priority accorded to the issue) at least 1,019 people were killed due to police intervention, and 76,440 were injured. This resulted in nearly 55,000 years of life lost, and had a large price tag, too: Police brutality costs $1.8 billion per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control's most recently available data (2010)."" Many argue that these two crises for the black community—police brutality and the coronavirus—aren't independent of each other. In fact, in both cases the extent of the death toll stems from systematic discrimination, and in both cases, the solution may require a deep rethinking of the overall system. In The Atlantic, Ibram X. Kendi examines a 1896 document by a statistician that says black people were naturally selected for disease and death, and would gradually become extinct. Kendi goes on to write that ""too many Americans have been waiting for black extinction since Hoffman,"" and that black Americans are ""living in a nightmare"" rather than the elusive American Dream: ""A nightmare is essentially a horror story of danger, but it is not wholly a horror story. Black people experience joy, love, peace, safety. But as in any horror story, those unforgettable moments of toil, terror, and trauma have made danger essential to the black experience in racist America. What one black American experiences, many black Americans experience. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the toil and terror and trauma of other black Americans. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the souls of the dead. Because they know: They could have been them; they are them. Because they know it is dangerous to be black in America, because racist Americans see blacks as dangerous."" Stories of solidarity Our NPR colleague Leila Fadel wrote about a Somali immigrant, Safia Munye, who opened a restaurant in Minneapolis more than two years ago—only to close her doors due to COVID-19. However, the community rallied behind her business and raised more than $180,000 to re-open this weekend—that is, until it was burned down during the protests. But despite her loss, Munye says she wants justice for George Floyd and change for Minneapolis. ""'My heart is broken. My mind is broken,' she says. 'I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice.'"" And The New York Times brought us another story about resilience and solidarity, about a Bangaldeshi family in Minneapolis who also lost their restaurant after it was burned down during one of the protests. Yet they support the uprising, and even opened the restaurant's doors as a medical haven for protesters. "" 'We were just trying to do what we could to help our community,' said [Hafsa] Islam, who helped treat wounded protesters. 'Sure, we had our business. Sure, we were trying to keep our kitchen open. But more than anything, we were concerned for our people.' ""The tension in [Ruhel] Islam's adopted city reminds him of his childhood in Bangladesh, when he lived through a dictatorship. Two of his fellow students were killed by the police, he said. 'We grew up in a traumatic police state, so I am familiar with this type of situation,' he said.""

But several states have primaries up and down the ballot: Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Washington, D.C. Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to do. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary with its 186 delegates). Steve King on the ropes. Controversial conservative Rep. Steve King of Iowa faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who painted King as ineffective in the House, given he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. State Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face off against either State Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks or ex-Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling, who moved to Iowa in 2017. Miller-Meeks got the backing of Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Fomer Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces challenge from the left. A veteran lawmaker from Maryland's 5th Congressional District and No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, Hoyer faces a progressive primary challenge from 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes. Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white, male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET Loading... Spy games in New Mexico. The announced retirement of New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall set off a domino effect. Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Luján declared for Udall's Senate seat, leaving open his seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Enter: Valerie Plame, the ex-CIA agent. She raised and spent more than any candidate in this race and gained national attention with her glossy campaign ad showing her racing backward in a Chevy Camaro on a dusty road. But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take Torres Small on this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It's been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... Senate match-ups to be set in Iowa and Montana. Democrats are hoping to take back the Senate this fall. They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired U.S. Admiral Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach, who has spent the second most — $1.4 million — on this primary. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... When Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock changed his mind and decided to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, it suddenly put this race on the map for Democrats in a big way. Three other Democrats are on the ballot Tuesday, but Bullock has been expected to win easily, raising more than 10 times his next opponent. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Indiana openings. The retirements of moderate Democrat Pete Visclosky in Indiana's 1st District and Republican Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in Congress, in the 5th District has opened up both of these ideologically divergent seats. More than half a dozen Democrats have competed in the 1st District, which is suburban and exurban Chicago, a place that went for Hillary Clinton with 54% of the vote in 2016. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET Loading... In the 5th District, a handful of Republicans have duked it out, including state Sen. Victoria Spartz, who raised and spent the most and got the backing of the Club for Growth, and Beth Henderson, a local businesswoman with the endorsement of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun. Democrats have rallied around one candidate, Christina Hale. This district has been in GOP hands for a long time, but it could be one to watch this fall.

Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful. But looting and vandalism in some areas along Van Nuys Boulevard prompted a response from officers, who fired bean bags. Authorities also responded to a fire at a strip mall, according to the Los Angeles Times. San Francisco Bay Area Some 15,000 people marched peacefully in downtown Oakland, according to a police spokesperson quoted in the East Bay Times. Most dispersed prior to the start of the city's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. More than 40 people were arrested for violating the curfew, according to the Oakland Police Department. The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said. Police said some protesters had vandalized a handful of vehicles, according to NPR member station KQED. More than a dozen San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions have imposed curfews in the wake of protests sparked by Floyd's death. Corrections: 6/02/20 A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that 15,000 people marched on Interstate 680 in Walnut Creek, Calif., and were dispersed by police. The correct figure is several hundred. The march by 15,000 people was peaceful and took place in Oakland, Calif.",0.0

Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a frequent target of Trump, called the phone call ""deeply disturbing,"" adding that instead of offering support or leadership to bring down the temperature at protests, Trump told governors to "" 'put it down' or we would be 'overridden.' "" ""The president repeatedly and viciously attacked governors, who are doing everything they can to keep the peace while fighting a once-in-a-generation global pandemic,"" Whitmer said in a statement. “The president’s dangerous comments should be gravely concerning to all Americans, because they send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division."" More:Whitmer: Trump 'determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division' Minneapolis police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder in manslaughter in Floyd's death. After a weekend of nationwide protests and riots, Trump went on an extended rant Monday morning in a conference call with governors of both parties, telling them that they need to arrest people and that ""most of you are weak."" He accused ""radicals"" and ""anarchists"" of being behind the unrest, and he urged governors to crack down on them. ""You have to dominate,"" he said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by multiple media outlets. ""If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate."" More:'Most of you are weak': Trump rails at the nation's governors, urges crackdown on violence Unlike some past controversial comments from Trump, at least one Republican governor joined the criticism. Gov. Charlie Baker, a moderate Republican from left-leaning Massachusetts who is typically reluctant to take aim at Trump, raised the remarks himself during a news conference. ""I heard what the president said today about 'dominating' and fighting,"" Baker said. ""I know I should be surprised when I hear incendiary words like this from him, but I'm not. At so many times during these past several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it was simply nowhere to be found. Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. ""That's not what we need in Boston. It's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" Baker said, appearing to choke up. ""And it's definitely not what we need right now across this great country of ours either."" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democratic rival of Trump, raised concerns about Trump's remarks directly to the president on the phone call, according to a transcript from the New York Times. Pritzker told Trump he's been ""extraordinarily concerned by the rhetoric that's been used by you."" He called it ""inflammatory,"" adding that leaders must call for both calmness and police reform. ""We've called out our National Guard and our state police, but the rhetoric that’s coming out of the White House is making it worse,” Pritzker said. “And I need to say that people are feeling real pain out there. And we’ve got to have national leadership in calling for calm and making sure that we’re addressing the concerns of the legitimate peaceful protesters. That will help us to bring order.” Trump quipped back: “OK, well thank you very much, J.B. I don’t like your rhetoric very much either because I watched it with respect to the coronavirus and I don’t like your rhetoric much either. I think you could have done a much better job, frankly.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a ontime Democratic presidential candidate, said on Twitter that Trump's remarks are ""the rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong, after building his entire political career on racism and the lie of birtherism. 'He is — again — failing to address the underlying injustices facing black Americans,"" Inslee wrote. ""It is not leadership."" Besides Baker, other Republicans governors did not appear to criticize Trump for his remarks, while some sought to explain the president's intentions. Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb, a Republican, did not address Trump's allegations directly, but said the president didn't want governors to ""get caught watching the paint dry."" More:Here's what Gov. Eric Holcomb had to say about Trump calling governors 'weak' Holcomb said the peaceful demonstrations were hijacked by those who want to create chaos and destruction. ""We have to make sure we are properly staged and positioned to meet this moment,"" Holcomb told reporters. ""They are tracking, as we are tracking, a very organized effort, domestic terrorism in the extreme across the country, and no state or community is immune."" He added: ""We have to be ready, and we are."" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms seemed to target Trump’s comments Monday during a campaign roundtable talk that Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden had with Democratic mayors. She was making the case that cities need more federal relief to shore up budget shortfalls amid the coronavirus crisis. ""To see the president of the United States say that he’s going to send the military into our communities, but hasn’t mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” Bottoms said.

If the current answer to those questions are as disappointing to you as they are to us, we call on the student body and the administration to join our campus community and the country in solidarity towards the common goals of liberty and justice.” ETSU President Brian Noland also made an address on Monday, asking how the university can “turn together to help us understand the past so that we can put together a better vision and a better future for ourselves and our children.” Noland began his address by reading the names of the first five black students to attend the university in 1956 and 1958, calling them “trailblazers” and saying they “saw the power of this institution to serve as a shining example for the region, the state and the nation as a whole to drive forward a path in which all individuals, irrespective of their race, color, creed or background, had the opportunity to attend college.” He then read off six other names: Christian Cooper, Ahmaud Arbery, Aiyana Jones, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin and George Floyd. “Those names tell a different story, a story of oppression, a story of violence, a story of unconscionable pain,” Noland said. “Those names evoke emotion, not only across society, but (in) us (as) individuals as we wrestle with: ‘How can one person act with such hatred against another?’ Noland said in the days since Floyd was killed, he’s “wrestled with anger, sympathy, pain, empathy and other words that I’ll not express” because he “can’t imagine what it would be like for my son to be in that position.” Later in his address he said he’s “looked at the events of the past weeks, months and, in many respects, the past couple years as a call action.” “How can this institution come together and focus on a vision — how can we take the vision that was shared by the five individuals who we celebrate in Borchuck Plaza?” Noland asked. “Because those visions lead to dreams, dreams lead to plans, plans lead to action and action helps us create a better future.” “We need wisdom now more than ever, and this region needs East Tennessee State University now more than ever,” Noland said. ETSU Vice President for Equity and Inclusion Keith Johnson said the university needed leadership to “step up,” and “listen to what people are saying,” while commending Noland’s response as “on point.” “Everyone is not OK, and I think what you see across the country is the result of people collectively saying enough is enough,” Johnson said. “For me, when I saw what happened to George Floyd I instantly thought about myself as an African-American man and I also thought about my son because it could’ve happened to us.” In an email sent to students, faculty and staff on Monday, Noland said more information will be shared “in the coming days” about a series of virtual support and dialogue opportunities for the community hosted by the Multicultural Center.",0.0

Look for updates on WJHL.com. Previous story: JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (WJHL) As protests across the nation continue in response to the death of George Floyd, the Tri-Cities area sees its 5th night of peaceful protests. Local African-American leaders told News Channel 11’s Pheben Kassahun what they hope happens and how to build on the justice they said is already in this community. A crowd gathered in Founders Park for a peaceful rally for justice, following the death of George Floyd, Monday afternoon. Organizers said the rally was sparked by the inaction of leaders across the nation. “The inaction of elected leaders to deal with serious public policy, the inaction of those with influence the critical conversations, in this case regarding race and descrimination. This long held history of inaction has lead to a negative reaction,” Town of Jonesborough alderman, Adam Dickson told Kassahun. Local African-American community leaders said Johnson City is already heading in the right direction. “If we can sit down somehow and hear them say, ‘this is what’s in place for you, this is how we have your back’, I’ll be happy,” Johnson City Board of Education member, Michelle Treece said. Johnson City Board of Education member, Michelle Treece, said she wants local leaders to walk hand-in-hand in the fight for justice. “There were a lot of folks, some elected officials were there, some ministers and I was glad that happened. It was a prayer vigil,” Treece said. “As that was wrapping up, they were a group that were walking in- “protesters” so-to-speak or those that were in solidarity, and I wanted to see the folks up on the steps– the elected officials, ministers in the area, the leaders– I really wanted them to come off those steps and join this group and just be there. They sang lift every voice and sing and I wanted them to sing that. I stayed, and they may have stayed and I didn’t see them but I saw a lot leave. Because that’s what the community needs to see that you’re with us and you see us.” Treece said Johnson City does not have the same issues as Minnesota, and she hopes the protests spark a discussion for local officials. Treece said, “Do our officers have training on this kind of thing, if and ever we needed it? Are they trained? What kind of provision is made for people of color in this town to make sure they’re fully part of this community.” SEE ALSO: Local police departments on guard in case protests escalate Treece added, “I think we have a community that is aware of what’s going on in our nation. We have small pockets of folks that those same national events impact here? Not at all at the same level but we have folks who are aware of that and I think when the community gets together and has a protest or vigil or stands in solidarity, I think it’s a way of saying, ‘We see you, we hear you and we want you to know that we support you.'” Good Samaritan Ministrieis CEO, Aaron Murphy, agrees. “There needs to be more conversations, there needs to be more sit-down meetings, there needs to be more. It hadn’t even been 60 years since there was segregation here,” Aaron Murphy said. Adam Dickson said he is grateful for how peaceful the protests have been. “I’m very grateful to see interacial cooperation and harmony. Folks wanting to come together to build community. Folks wanting to come together to say that they understand,” Dickson said. He hopes the community can build on this. “Talk about such things as providing opportunities for the community to speak so that we can listen. How do we promote healing, how do we promote a new generation of servant leaders,” Town of Jonesborough alderman Adam Dickson said. Treece also warned about people with alterior motives when peaceful protesters are taking place. “I think people come in and want to cause some destruction. We’ve had things and vigils in Founder’s Park in the past and nice things are going on and all of a sudden, you have a group who has nothing to do with this particular event, come in and want to start calling names and waving different flags and things like that,” Treece said. Local NAACP chapter President Jean Neal, released a statement about the Tri-Cities protests stating: “We are calling for the arrest and conviction of officer Derek Chauvin as well as the other three officers. We are saying Enough is Enough. We must keep our focus on redressing the systemic racism against out communities that led to this tragedy. We are requesting that everyone get out and vote and fill out Census Report. Join the local NAACP to help bring about a change. It is time for action instead of talk. Thank You.” Jean Neal President Johnson City/Washington County NAACP SEE ALSO: Family autopsy: Floyd asphyxiated by sustained pressure",0.0

(WKRN) —- On Monday, hundreds joined forces for a peaceful protest at the Tennessee state capitol, voicing their anger with the death of George Floyd. Organizer and refugee, Kayo Beshir, told News 2 that their goal is to achieve change in peaceful way. He referenced the riots that took place in Nashville on Saturday night, as a distraction to the peaceful message that was shared during the ‘I will Breathe’ rally earlier on the same day. During Monday’s demonstration, the crowd sang hymnals, chanted and called for action against what they called, unjust policing. Some shared their Christian faith, asking for others of faith to support and advocate for change. “We recognize that Jesus’ death was both a sacrifice and a murder, and when you identify it as a murder we have a responsibility to be out here demanding justice for acts of cruelty and acts of violence.” said Russell Pointer Jr. a pastor. Activist and Reverend, Justin Jones said the turmoil won’t end until racist institutions are dismantled and new legislation protects against unjust policing. At one point during the event, people walked in groups of two up to the state capitol. Some state representatives held up the barrier tape allowing protesters to pass through. Once at the top of the capitol, protestors asked the Tennessee National Guard to drop their shields and they did. The crowd exploded in cheers and someone said through a megaphone, “We want to thank our National Guard for being on the right side of history.” Jones called their actions, a divine occurrence, “it was a movement of faith for them to put down their swords and shields, because we came up here singing and we came up here prayerful. We are here to bring peace and change.”",0.0
1623204635,2020-06-02 05:17:46,Police: 4 St. Louis officers hit by gunfire during protests,https://www.wkrn.com/news/police-4-st-louis-officers-hit-by-gunfire-during-protests/,en,True,,84748,wkrn.com,http://www.wkrn.com/#spider,"O’FALLON, Mo. (AP) — St. Louis police said four officers were hit by gunfire after protests that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with protesters smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area. The police department said on Twitter early Tuesday that the officers were taken to an area hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots. The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City. The nationwide protests were sparked by the May 25 death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck until he stopped breathing. Monday’s protests came after peaceful daytime protests Sunday led to spurts of chaos overnight into Monday, with vehicles and buildings damaged and officers firing tear gas after being pelted with rocks, fireworks and Molotov cocktails. On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64. But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. Moments later a car was set on fire and other businesses broken into and looted. On Monday afternoon, Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas and Police Chief Rick Smith kneeled with protesters gathered at the Country Club Plaza entertainment district and had what police spokesman Sgt. Jake Becchina later described as a good conversation with the crowd. Not long after, Becchina said items were thrown at police and pepper spray was used. More people began to arrive later in the evening and he said about “half a dozen”people had been detained, some who had sacks of rocks and bags of urine. Nearly 2,000 protesters gathered early Monday evening on the Capitol grounds in Jefferson City, carrying signs reading “white silence is violence” and “say their names.” Police estimated that more than 1,500 people turned out in O’Fallon, about 35 miles (56.33 kilometers) west of St. Louis. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Police Chief Tim Clothier locked arms and marched with protesters, saying he wanted to show support for their cause. “We do not agree with what happened. We do not want to condone the behavior of that one officer,” Clothier said. Republican Gov. Mike Parson said Monday that the Missouri National Guard and the Missouri State Highway Patrol are ready if violence persists. “We support peaceful protesters and we are committed to protecting the lawful exercise of these rights,” Parson, a former sheriff, said. “But violence and destruction will never be the answer. It does not help us achieve justice or peace. Instead it terrorizes innocent people and families, destroys our communities and creates more anger and pain.” Tensions boiled over Sunday in Kansas City and Ferguson, the city in St. Louis County that became synonymous with the Black Lives Matter movement after the August 2014 killing of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old, by a white police officer. Just as in 2014, the Ferguson Police Department was a focus of demonstrators on Sunday for a second night. Police began dispersing the crowd shortly after 10 p.m., but some people damaged windows at Ferguson Brewing Co. just down the street. Minutes later, after someone threw a Molotov cocktail at a police car, officers responded with tear gas and ordered protesters to clear the area. St. Louis County police reported that two officers suffered minor injuries. One was hit by fireworks, the other by a rock. Six people were arrested, police spokesman Benjamin Granda said. Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said Marcus Marvin Hunt was arrested Saturday in St. Louis and accused of distributing information on making explosives and destructive devices. Schmitt said a person in St. Louis was charged with organizing and promoting a riot. The second suspect’s name wasn’t released.",0.0
1623204632,2020-06-02 05:40:04,Trump threatens military force against protesters nationwide,https://www.wkrn.com/news/trump-threatens-military-force-against-protesters-nationwide/,en,True,,84748,wkrn.com,http://www.wkrn.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Wielding extraordinary federal authority, President Donald Trump threatened the nation’s governors on Monday that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation over the past week. His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump’s bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John’s Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” “It’s all just a reality TV show for this president,” he said on Twitter. “Shameful.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city’s flagship Macy’s store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Full Coverage: America Protests Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd’s brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press.",0.0

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) NEW YORK (AP) — The music industry is planning to turn off the music and hold a day to reflect and implement change in response to the death of George Floyd and the killings of other black people. Several top record labels organized Black Out Tuesday as violent protests erupted around the world sparked by Floyd’s death as well as the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Music-based companies Live Nation and TikTok, as well as the Recording Academy, posted to social media that it planned to support and stand with the black community. “On Tuesday June 2nd, Columbia Records will observe ‘Black Out Tuesday,’” the Sony label home to Beyoncé, Bob Dylan, Adele and John Legend said in a statement. “This is not a day off. Instead, this is a day to reflect and figure out ways to move forward in solidarity.” “We continue to stand with the Black community, our staff, artists, and peers in the music industry,” the company continued. “Perhaps with the music off, we can truly listen.” Others that have joined Black Out Tuesday include the Sony imprints RCA Records and Epic Records; the Universal Music Group divisions Republic Records, Def Jam, UMG Nashville, Capitol Records and Island Records; and the Warner Music Group imprints Atlantic and Warner Records. Smaller, independent labels as well as music publishing companies and management firms have also signed on. UMG’s Interscope Geffen A&M said that in addition to joining Black Out Tuesday, the label home to Lady Gaga and Kendrick Lamar would not release music this week — the first label to do so. “Instead, IGA will contribute to organizations that help to bail out protesters exercising their right to peacefully assemble, aid lawyers working for systemic change and provide assistance to charities focused on creating economic empowerment in the Black community,” its statement read. IGA postponed new music releases MGK, 6lack, Dylan, Jessie Ware, Smokepurp, Lil Mosey, Billy Raffoul, Max Leone and more in coordination with their partners Alamo, LVRN, The Darkroom, Bad Boy and more. Musicians including Rihanna, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Lil Nas X, Demi Lovato, Post Malone and Harry Styles have spoken out following Floyd’s death and worldwide protests. Jay-Z released a statement late Sunday calling for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to prosecute those responsible for killing Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck. “I, along with an entire country in pain, call upon AG Ellison to do the right thing and prosecute all those responsible for the murder of George Floyd to the fullest extent of the law. This is just a first step. I am more determined to fight for justice than any fight my would-be oppressors may have,” Jay-Z said. “I prevail on every politician, prosecutor and officer in the country to have the courage to do what is right. Have the courage to look at us as humans, dads, brothers, sisters and mothers in pain and look at yourselves.” Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Taylor to death in her home in March. The R&B duo Chloe x Halle, who will release their sophomore album “Ungodly Hour” on Friday, posted a cover of the classic civil rights anthem and protest song “We Shall Overcome” to Instagram. “This week has been very heavy for all of us. We’ve been trying to, not understand, because there’s no way to understand the terrible killings — we just have heavy hearts this week and are just trying to do everything we can to pray and lift each other up with our voices,” Halle said in an interview with The Associated Press. “With everything going on, we felt like music can be very healing, because it’s been that way for us in kind of keeping us sane during this time,” Chloe added. As much as we could, we just wanted to share our gift of song to even just lift spirits for even a few seconds.”",0.0

(AP) — Riot police firing tear gas scattered a protest crowd from a downtown Louisville square Monday night, hours after the firing of the city’s police chief in the uproar over the early morning shooting death of a popular restaurant owner by security forces. David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue spot who was known for offering meals to police officers, died while police and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew early Monday amid waves of protests over a previous police shooting in Kentucky’s largest city. Police said they were responding to gunfire from a crowd. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced the firing of Police Chief Steve Conrad at a news conference Monday. He said officers involved in the shooting failed to activate body cameras at the chaotic scene. Authorities had sought footage for their investigation, after Kentucky’s governor demanded the release of police video. “This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,” Fischer said. “Accordingly, I have relieved Steve Conrad of his duties as chief of Louisville Metro Police Department.” Gov. Andy Beshear later called the lack of body camera footage unacceptable. “This is the entire reason that we have those cameras,” the Democratic governor said at the state Capitol in Frankfort. Beshear authorized state police to independently investigate, promising the probe will be conducted in an “honest and transparent way that will not take months.” U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman announced that federal authorities will be part of the investigation. The governor said he had counted on body camera footage to help determine “the truth in a way that spoke for itself, at a time when trust is difficult and people deserve to be able to see and evaluate.” Late Monday afternoon, a huge group stretching several city blocks marched peacefully from downtown Louisville to the spot where McAtee was shot. Some motorists honked horns and raised fists in solidarity. Hundreds of protesters regrouped later Monday night at downtown Jefferson Square and riot police standing shoulder to shoulder advanced amid burts of fired tear gas, dispersing the crowd. Military-style vehicles could later be seen occupying the emptied-out square. The shakeup at the top of the city’s police department came a month earlier than expected. Conrad had previously announced his resignation, which was to take effect at the end of June. Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder will step in immediately as chief, Fischer said. The mayor also said the city’s curfew was being extended until June 8. Police did retrieve video from crime center cameras that showed how the shooting unfolded, Schroeder said. Two Louisville officers and two Guard soldiers returned fire, he said. The two officers violated policy by not wearing or activating body cameras, Schroeder said, adding they have been placed on administrative leave. McAtee, whose YaYa’s BBQ Shack is near where the shooting occurred, was mourned by hundreds. Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist and executive director of the group Game Changers, said McAtee was well-liked. “I’ve never known him to be aggressive in any kind of way,” he said. Schroeder agreed that McAtee was friendly to police officers. “Over the years he’s been a good friend to the police officers … frequently making sure our officers had a good meal on their shifts,” he said. Before his dismissal, Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. Monday outside a food market on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a group of curfew violators. Someone fired a shot at law enforcement officials, and both soldiers and officers returned fire, he said. Several “persons of interest” were being interviewed, he said. News outlets showed video taken by someone in a car parked at a gas station. It recorded the sound of bullets being fired as groups of police and Guard soldiers crouched behind cars. Kris Smith said he was at a restaurant — “just outside having a good time, having drinks, eating barbecue” — when the soldiers arrived. “As soon as I walk to my car they jump out with the sticks, the police jump out with their sticks and their shields and stuff on,” Smith said. “It looked like something out of a movie. It looked like a freaking war zone.” He said he heard a loud noise, then gunfire minutes later. Smith, who is black, said the group had nothing to do with the protests. Protesters have been demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home. After Taylor’s death, the mayor said Louisville police would be required to wear body cameras.",0.0

(WTVF) — Ernest “RIP” Patton will always take the opportunity to remind people about Nashville’s pivotal role in the civil rights movement. He hopes the ongoing fight for social justice and equality in the future will shed the same actions he witnessed during the unrest on Saturday night. The Nashville native and civil rights activist took time on Monday to see the vandalism and damage to the Historic Metro Courthouse in person. Groups of people turned what was a peaceful rally against police brutality and racism earlier in the day in downtown to hours of violence. Metro police said at least 30 businesses were damaged and nearly 30 people were arrested including Wesley Somers, the man accused of lighting a piece of the building on fire. The walls filled with profanity was upsetting enough, but what rioters did to a plaque honoring the civil rights era made it more disappointing for Patton. Mayor John Cooper said some broke the plaque into pieces and used them to shatter the windows. “I was appalled. It even hurts me to stand here and think about what these people, young and old, did here this past weekend,” Patton told NewsChannel 5. “It overshadows and to me, it says you don’t know the history of Nashville.” Patton was a student who joined the movement and was even arrested as a Freedom Rider, and worked alongside iconic civil rights leader such as Representative John Lewis. He also worked with Diane Nash, the trailblazer the plaque was dedicated to. She was instrumental in the sit ins demonstrations, formed a student movement and helped desegregate lunch counters. Nash also led thousands of people in the historic silent march to the courthouse and confronted Mayor Ben West about equal treatment after the home of prominent civil rights attorney Z. Alexander Looby was bombed. “We were having a silent march, you could not talk to the person next to you. We wanted Nashville to hear our footsteps,” Patton recalled. The same demonstration was a stark difference to the unruly behavior during the riot on Saturday. Patton knows the incident doesn’t represent the protest as a whole. Organizers have spoken out against the violence and vandalism that happened after the “I Will Breathe” rally. Thousands gathered at Legislative Plaza in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The investigation is ongoing into who all were involved in the vandalism and what roles they played, and if there were outside influences. In a city where protests have historically been calm and peaceful, Patton believed Nashville will regain itself after the weekend.",0.0

Wesley Dale Somers, 25, was arrested Sunday night on charges of aggravated arson, arson, vandalism and disorderly conduct. Metro Nashville police said Somers was identified with help from the community after photos of him at the demonstration were widely circulated on social media. Somers, who previously was listed at a Little Braden Lane address in the Mascot area, was convicted of DUI in Knox County in 2017, according to court records. A fire is started outside the Metro Courthouse in Nashville, Tennessee, on Saturday, May 30, 2020, after the “I Will Breathe” rally to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being pinned down while handcuffed by a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day. Police identified the man shown as Wesley Somers, 25, and charged him with arson on Sunday. (Photo: Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean) His criminal history also includes convictions for domestic assault and attempted child neglect in Sumner and Davidson counties, respectively. Somers' mother, Misty Somers, of Knoxville, pleaded for help in a Facebook post Monday to raise funds to cover his bond, which is set at $755,000. ""He just got caught up in the moment,"" she wrote. ""He was the sole supporter for his little family. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!""

Neither his mother nor his wife was immediately available for comment Monday afternoon. The historic building, which serves as Nashville's city hall, was damaged and set on fire following the peaceful demonstration — one of several happening across the country — that drew more than a thousand people to the core of the city in protest of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis as well as systemic police violence against black Americans. Police say 20 to 30 people drove the violence. The courthouse windows were smashed, its walls were spray painted with graffiti and fires were started inside the building. A plaque commemorating the civil rights movement in Nashville also was destroyed.

Thousands took to the streets of Nashville on Saturday — one of many protests, peaceful or otherwise, nationwide — following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck despite Floyd’s cries that he could not breathe. Chauvin and three other officers involved in the incident were quickly fired after video footage surfaced, and Chauvin was arrested Friday. Following a peaceful “I Will Breathe” rally in Nashville, people shattered windows, graffitied buildings and set a fire at the Metro courthouse. Two men have been charged with felonies in connection with Saturday's events. Wesley Somers, 25, is facing charges of aggravated arson and disorderly conduct in connection with fires set at the Metro courthouse. Tondrique Fitzgerald, 23, is accused of pulling a granite plaque commemorating the civil rights movement in Nashville off the exterior of the courthouse. At least 28 others faced misdemeanor charges. One — a 17-year-old girl — was charged with breaking a 10 p.m. curfew set by Tennessee officials. Though the teen wasn’t the only one arrested after the imposed curfew, most others were accused of disorderly conduct and other charges. Twenty-one faced disorderly conduct charges after Saturday night’s protests, accused of screaming, throwing objects and obstructing traffic, according to affidavits filed in Davidson County. Police said some refused to leave when fires were started at properties along or near Broadway. A 20-year-old man was charged with disorderly conduct and possession of a handgun around 11 p.m. at the Capitol. Officers found the loaded .45 caliber handgun in the man’s waistband, and the man also had five loaded magazines, the Davidson County affidavit states. An Arlington, Texas man was accused of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest on Korean Veterans Boulevard at around 7:15 p.m. Though the majority of the 28 arrested were from Nashville or other nearby cities in Middle Tennessee, out-of-state travelers arrived from Texas, Illinois and New York. Three Nashville men were charged with assaulting an officer, two on Korean Veterans Boulevard about a half hour apart and another on Deadrick Street shortly after 11 p.m. MNPD said no officers were harmed during the protest, although some were pelted with rocks. In one instance, the man, “approached the officer and punched him with a balled up fist in the victim’s jaw,” according to the affidavit filed in Davidson County. Then, the man “yanked” the officer’s $300 watch, “breaking it and rendering it useless.” In another instance, a man is accused of throwing ""an unknown object” at two Metro Nashville Police Department bicycle officers. He fled on foot, resisting arrest once stopped, the affidavit states. A 25-year-old Hermitage man was charged with criminal trespassing at the Capitol. A Nashville man was charged with burglary on Broadway — two hats from Boot Barn, with price tags still on them. Another was charged with public intoxication on Broadway around midnight. Most of the arrests, 23, were of men, ages 21 to 61. Five women, ages 17 to 28, were charged. Of those arrested, police say 16 people are black, 11 are white and one is Hispanic. Organizers of Saturday afternoon’s peaceful “I Will Breathe” demonstration have since condemned the violence. Officials continued implementing curfews, for 8 p.m. Sunday and 10 p.m. Monday night.

Public health experts said Monday that it generally takes five to seven days for symptoms of the virus to surface in new cases, and generally a little more than twice that long for the most severe cases of the virus to cause hospitalizations and deaths. Protests in Nashville and other cities will also likely “substantially inhibit” efforts to slow the virus through contact tracing, which is inherently dependent on trust in the government, said Dr. William Schaffner, a renown infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Contact tracing is a practice by which public health investigators meticulously interview people with coronavirus to find others who might also be infected. The tactic is reliant on people knowing who they spent time with and being willing to give this information to the government. “If there is not trust, these people who are asked are going to be reluctant to participate,” Schaffner said. “This is a particular concern in the African-American community, because that’s a community most affected and where the trust is least.” Thousands hit the streets of Nashville on Saturday for a peaceful rally followed by pockets of violence and vandalism that damaged city hall and other downtown buildings. A smaller vigil and protest followed in Murfreesboro on Sunday. Both events were spurred by the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed by a white police officer who pinned him to the ground with a knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25. The death has inflamed simmering tensions between people of color and law enforcement, leading to a week of rallies, protests, marches and riots in cities across the United States. NASHVILLE RIOT: Arrest made in historic Nashville courthouse fire Protest crowds gathered just as those same cities are attempting to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected about 1.7 million Americans and killed more than 103,000. In Nashville, the virus has been detected in 5,517 people – including 4,165 who have already recovered – and killed at least 63. The Nashville outbreak has plateaued in recent weeks, and city leaders have cautiously lifted restrictions on residents and businesses in an effort to return to a semblance of normal life. Dr. Alex Jahangir, chairman of the Nashville Board of Health and head of the city’s coronavirus task force, said he did not believe attendance at the protests alone was a reason to be tested for the virus. But Jahangir stressed anyone who develops symptoms should get tested and anyone who is “concerned” they were exposed is welcome to get tested, regardless of if they were at the protest or not. “The mere fact of being at any of the rallies or protests this weekend, I would not say you necessarily need to get tested,” Jahangir said. “But if you do need to be tested, or you are worried about it, we have community assessment centers and we have our hotline if you want to speak to someone further.” Schaffner described the protests as a worrisome combination of factors: Protesters spent hours in close proximity, shouting and chanting, potentially passing infected droplets back and forth; and because they were protesting racial injustice, many in the crowd were people of color, who already disproportionately affected by coronavirus. The only good news, he said, is the protests occurred outside, where the virus appears less likely to spread, and that many of the protesters wore masks. “And all of this happened as we were opening up society generally,” Schaffner said. “So if COVID-19 came to the demonstrations and was spread … it will be a little harder to determine if the demonstrations were the accelerator.” Brett Kelman is the health care reporter for The Tennessean.

Video provided to News 2 by Tyler Croney shows what appears to be law enforcement deploying the gas into a crowd including multiple children. Croney told News 2 none of the children in attendance were older than 12 years old. The protest began Sunday in Murfreesboro’s historic town square, where businesses boarded up their windows in preparation for the crowds. After the demonstration, crowds began making their way to nearby Middle Tennessee State University’s campus, where tear gas was deployed by Murfreesboro police. MORE: Demonstrations end with tear gas in Murfreesboro The gas was deployed at the intersection of East Main Street and Middle Tennessee Boulevard at a crowd of protesters who were blocking the intersection and were almost hit by traffic, according to Murfreesboro police. An armored vehicle was also vandalized. Murfreesboro Mayor Shane McFarland answered questions Monday about why the tear gas was used, saying the gas was necessary to break up protesters who were blocking the intersection and on top of cars. “They shot tear gas to move people out of the roads, and that’s something, I want to say. I understand the peaceful protest, but sitting in the middle of the road was not helping anything besides our residents being in danger, the protesters being in danger,” explained Mayor McFarland. Mayor McFarland said he hopes the peaceful demonstrations will lead to a community conversation about how to be better. “It’s very important that we make sure that we protect residents and protesters, but the men and women of the our Murfreesboro Police Department, of our Rutherford County Sheriff’s Office, are not representative of what happened in Minnesota. That’s not representative of what we have in our community nor what we’ve what we’ve ever had in our community,” said Mayor McFarland. No additional protests are planned in Murfreesboro.

(WKRN) — Cleanup continues in downtown Nashville after peaceful protests turned violent last weekend as multiple businesses and Nashville’s Historic Courthouse were damaged. Crews began cleaning up the damage at the courthouse Monday after every window on the first floor was shattered as rioters started fires and painted profane graffiti. A second person was arrested Monday in connection with vandalism at the courthouse, 23-year-old Tondrique Fitzgerald. He was charged with aggravated rioting and felony vandalism after he allegedly pulled a granite civil rights plaque from the courthouse wall, smashed it into pieces, which he used to break courthouse windows. The major damage to the front offices primarily affected the mayor’s office as well as transportation and finance departments. Right now, there is no price tag set for how much the damage will cost Nashville’s government. A curfew was enforced for Nashville for a third day in a row and Mayor John Cooper said he will evaluate the need for additional curfews on a daily basis. Metro police Chief Steve Anderson said more arrests could be coming. “Our investigation into this has not stopped. There are many others. We’ve received a significant number of tips from Crime Stoppers concerning persons who essentially betrayed the protestors who wanted to exercise their freedom to voice their concerns and instead resorted to criminal acts,” explained Chief Anderson.

1623207152,2020-06-02 08:18:23,"Tear gas, threats for protesters before Trump visits church",http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129805,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — It began with Attorney General Bill Barr standing with his hands casually in his pockets, not wearing a tie, surveying the scene at Lafayette Park across from the White House, where several thousand protesters had gathered for more demonstrations after the police killing of George Floyd. President Donald Trump had announced he would soon be addressing the nation from the White House Rose Garden, as a 7 p.m. curfew in the city loomed and a mass of law enforcement, including U.S. Secret Service agents, Park Police and National Guardsmen, stood sentry, many dressed in riot gear. Moments before 6:30 p.m., just when Trump said he would begin his address, the officers suddenly marched forward, directly confronting the protesters as many held up their hands, saying, ""Don't shoot."" Soon, law enforcement officers were aggressively forcing the protesters back, firing tear gas and deploying flash bangs into the crowd to disperse them from the park for seemingly no reason. It was a jarring scene as police in the nation's capital forcefully cleared young men and women gathered legally in a public park on a sunny evening, all of it on live television. With smoke still wafting and isolated tussles continuing in the crowd, Trump emerged in the Rose Garden for a dramatic split-screen of his own creation. ""I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,"" he declared, before demanding that governors across the nation deploy the National Guard ""in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets."" And he warned that, if they refused, he would deploy the United States military ""and quickly solve the problem for them."" As an additional show of force, Trump announced he was deploying even more of the military to Washington, D.C., giving it the feel of an armed, locked-down city after days of violent clashes, arson and looting. ""As we speak I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers,"" he said, as explosions rang out in the background. ""We are putting everybody on warning."" Then, before departing, Trump announced he wasn't done for the evening, and would be ""going to pay my respects to a very very special place."" Moments later, the White House press pool was quickly summoned for a surprise movement. And soon after, Trump strolled out of the White House gates — something he had never done before — and walked across the park that had just been cleared to accommodate his movements. Trump walked slowly, followed by an entourage of his most senior aides, security and reporters. The faint residue of pepper spray hung in the air, stinging eyes and prompting coughing. Sections of the park and surrounding sidewalks were strewn with garbage, including plastic water bottles and other debris. Some sections had been scrawled with graffiti. Trump crossed H Street and walked toward St. John's Church, the landmark pale yellow building where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, then raised a black-covered Bible for reporters to see. ""We have a great country,"" Trump said. ""Greatest country in the world."" He didn't talk about Floyd, the church or the damage it had suffered, or the peaceful protesters police had cleared. He said nothing about the coronavirus pandemic, the parallel crisis that has continued to ravage the nation as Trump campaigns for a second presidential term. And then he invited his attorney general, national security adviser, chief of staff, press secretary and defense secretary — all white — to join him for another round of photos before he walked back across the park to the White House. At one point, he stopped and pumped his fist in the air at National Guard members in the distance. ""We're going to keep it nice and safe,"" he said. Rabbi Jack Moline, the president of Interfaith Alliance, slammed the fact that peaceful protesters near the White House were gassed and shot with rubber bullets so Trump could hold his photo op. ""Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John's Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice — right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area — is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,"" Moline said in a statement. This only underscores the president's complete lack of compassion for Black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism."" And the Right Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, to which St. John's belongs, said she was ""outraged"" by the moment and noted that Trump didn't pray during his visit.

1623207148,2020-06-02 08:17:24,"Amid protests, Trump talks of war — and reelection",http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129803,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump toured a Catholic shrine on Tuesday in his second straight religious-themed appearance as the nation grappled with widespread unrest over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Critics said the president was misusing religious symbols for partisan purposes. The White House said Trump and first lady Melania Trump were observing a ""moment of remembrance,"" laying a wreath in a quiet visit to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine. The visit came a day after Trump declared himself to be the ""president of law and order"" and then walked to St. John's Episcopal Church across from the White House after Lafayette Park was forcibly cleared of protesters. He held up a Bible for photos in front of the church, known as ""The Church of the Presidents,"" which had been damaged by fire during weekend protests. On Tuesday's drive to the shrine, Trump's motorcade sped past National Guard members deployed around the World War II Memorial. Some onlookers along the route booed, held ""Black lives matter"" signs or made obscene gestures as the convoy rolled past. Back at the White House, Trump signed an executive order to advance international religious freedom during a private Oval Office event with the first lady, Vice President Mike Pence and others, according to senior adviser Kellyanne Conway. Conway defended Trump amid continued criticism of the St. John's visit, telling Fox News Channel that he held up a Bible outside the church as a ""symbol"" to those who set it afire. On Monday evening, Trump had appeared in the White House Rose Garden and threatened to deploy active duty military across the country to quell sometimes-violent unrest in the wake of the death of Floyd. Trump made his declaration to the sound of tear gas clearing largely peaceful protesters from Lafayette Park. It created a split screen for the ages, with Trump's critics saying the president was deepening divisions at a time when leadership was crucial to help unify a fractured country. Criticism continued Tuesday. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory said he was ""baffled"" by Trump's visit to the shrine and called it ""reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree."" Gregory said the late pope was an ""ardent defender"" of human rights. ""He certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship,"" Gregory said in a statement. The president's forceful turn to a partisan posture was reminiscent of the us-vs.-them rhetoric he has often used when under pressure, including in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. He has responded to the violence with a string of polarizing tweets, one starkly laying out the political stakes by underscoring the approach of Election Day. ""NOVEMBER 3RD,"" was all it said. Trump vowed to deploy the U.S. military to America's own cities to quell a rise of violent protests, including ransacking stores and burning police cars. He offered little recognition of the anger coursing through the country as he demanded a harsher crackdown on the mayhem that has erupted following the death of Floyd. Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed Floyd's neck with his knee as the man pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Violent demonstrations have raged in scores of American cities, marking a level of unrest unseen for decades. The political ground beneath Trump has greatly shifted in the spring of this election year. He was supposed to be running on a strong economy, but now he's facing a pandemic, an economic collapse and civil unrest not seen since the 1960s. Indeed, some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Republican Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate after a summer of riots and captured the White House. But Trump is the incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence, despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider. Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, commented Tuesday in Philadelphia on Trump's posing with a Bible. ""I just wish he opened it once in a while.,"" Biden said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at the Capitol, ""We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many other presidents before him and be the healer in chief, and not a fanner of the flame."" She also quoted verses from the Bible. Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde, whose diocese includes St. John's, also criticized Trump's use of the church. ""The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,"" she said. The church stop and Rose Garden speech followed a video teleconference Trump held on Monday morning with governors, during which he derided them as ineffective in dealing with protests in their cities. ""Most of you are weak,"" he said. ""It's like a war. And we will end it fast. Be tough."" ""You have to dominate"" and ""if you don't dominate you're wasting your time,"" Trump said, demanding the protests be swiftly crushed, even as some warned that such an aggressive law enforcement response could lead to an escalation of violence. He urged governors to make more use of the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and other cities. ___ Lemire reported from New York.

1623207143,2020-06-02 08:16:54,Showdown: Law-and-order president versus protesters,http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129802,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday turned up the pressure on governors to quell the violence set off by the death of George Floyd, demanding New York call up the National Guard to stop the ""lowlifes and losers."" As cities around the U.S. witnessed a seventh straight night of both peaceful demonstrations and bursts of theft, vandalism and attacks on police, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn't do it. ""NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,"" he tweeted. ""The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast! Don't make the same horrible and deadly mistake you made with the Nursing Homes!!!"" In New York on Monday night, people smashed shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breached the doors of Macy's flagship store on 34th Street despite the first curfew in the city in decades. Police said nearly 700 people were arrested and several officers injured in the overnight violence. New York and other cities braced for more trouble after nightfall Tuesday, with Mayor Bill de Blasio extending an 8 p.m. curfew all week. ""We're going to have a tough few days,"" he warned, but added: ""We're going to beat it back."" He said he would do that with the help of community leaders, urging them to step forward: ""Create peace. ... Stand up."" More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them. De Blasio has said he does not want the Guard, and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said he will not send it into the city against the mayor's wishes. During the violence that gripped communities from coast to coast again on Monday night, police officers were shot, run over and showered with rocks and bottles. In Atlanta, police fired tear gas at demonstrators. In Nashville, more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters. And at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, an SUV plowed into a group of officers, injuring three. An officer was shot and gravely wounded as police tried to disperse a crowd outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. ""We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. In Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, Mayor Jim Kenney described a chaotic night in which one person was killed attempting to use explosives to open an ATM, a gun shop owner fatally shot a would-be thief, and a 19-year-old died of injuries during looting. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. ""I fear for my safety every time I get in the car to go for a drive. I fear of getting pulled over. I fear for all 10 of my brothers' and sisters' lives, for my parents' lives!"" 19-year-old Amari Burroughs of Parkland, Florida, said Tuesday as she prepared for another protest. ""My goal is to use my voice and my leadership to make this world safer so that one day I can bring children here and won't have to fear for their safety."" Outside the Minnesota Capitol in St. Paul, where a youth protest was held Tuesday, 18-year-old Joseph Tawah agreed. ""It's really hard not to feel afraid,"" he said. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. In Richmond, Virginia, several hundred people gathered outside City Hall on Tuesday, shouting down Mayor Levar Stoney, who apologized for police lobbing tear gas at peaceful demonstrators. ""Where were you last night when we were being tear-gassed?"" a woman yelled. ""Where were you? Where were you? Where were you?"" the crowd chanted. Meanwhile, Democratic governors and mayors rejected Trump's threat to send in the military, questioning whether the federal government has such authority and warning that such a step would be incendiary. De Blasio said military troops would create ""a dangerous scenario,"" while Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock likewise warned such a move would just lead to more violence and destruction. ""Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,"" they said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower's use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. Even some in the president's own party rebuffed the idea, including Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who said his state has what it needs. ""The military is here to protect and defend this country. We don't have that need here in this state,"" he said. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump's threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. The president is not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The unrest in Minneapolis, meanwhile, appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd's brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck for several minutes, even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. Floyd's family was expected to join a march in Houston on Tuesday. The state of Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. In Atlanta, six officers were charged Tuesday after a video showed authorities dragging two young people from a car during protests. Sending the military into the states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But some state officials asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. ___ Sedensky reported from Philadelphia.

1623207141,2020-06-02 08:16:33,Barr: Law enforcement must 'dominate' streets amid protests,http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129801,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials vowed to ""maximize federal law enforcement presence"" in the nation's capital after days of violent demonstrations led to fires across Washington and left scores of businesses with broken windows and dozens of police officers injured. In a call with governors Monday, President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The comments from Trump, Barr and other federal officials appeared aimed at avoiding similar scenes Monday night. But there were also questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Barr told the state leaders that law enforcement officials must ""have adequate force"" and ""go after troublemakers."" ""Law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets,"" Barr said. Trump said he was ""taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America."" The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. ""Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,"" Trump said. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" Trump directed Barr to ""lead federal law enforcement efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia,"" Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said. Minutes before Trump spoke Monday evening in the Rose Garden of the White House, police and members of the National Guard took aggressive action, using tear gas and flash bangs, to move back peaceful protesters who were outside Lafayette Park, across from the White House. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. After speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump then walked slowly out of the White House gates, senior aides and security with him, across the park to the landmark St. John's Church, where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump then stood alone in front of cameras and raised a Bible — and declared, ""We have a great country,"" he said. ""Greatest country in the world."" Officials in Arlington, Virginia, later ordered the county's police, who were helping with crowd control in Lafayette Square under a mutual aid request from U.S. Park Police, to leave Monday night. Arlington County Board Chair Libby Garvey tweeted that she was ""appalled"" that the mutual aid agreement was ""abused to endanger their and others safety for a photo op"" by Trump. A statement from the county said it was ""re-evaluating the agreements that allowed our officers to be put in a compromising position that endangered their health and safety, and that of the people around them, for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation's capital, a senior Justice Department official said. Barr was traveling around Washington on Monday night to observe the protests, according to the senior Justice Department official, who would not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies ""confronting the lawless actions of rioters,"" the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other ""anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The FBI is using its network of regional joint terrorism task forces to ""identify criminal organizers,"" and federal prosecutors across the country have been instructed to share information and utilize federal riot, arson or terror statutes against any ""violent radical agitators"" who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the ""violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups"" as domestic terrorism. Although there isn't a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. Between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states — Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Utah — are being sent to D.C. to provide assistance, senior Defense Department officials said. Those troops are either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. In addition, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

1623207105,2020-06-02 08:14:03,"Tennessee Floyd protests result in arrests, curfews",http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129794,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 NASHVILLE (AP) — Nearly 50 people were arrested over the weekend in Tennessee, while many businesses saw property damaged and public buildings vandalized across the state during peaceful protests that turned violent in response to the death of George Floyd. Volunteers continued cleanup efforts, scrubbing away graffiti and removing the debris of two days of protests. The demonstrations, like others nationwide, erupted after the death of George Floyd, a black man in handcuffs who pleaded for air as a white officer in Minnesota pressed a knee into his neck last week. They continued Monday evening with a peaceful protest outside the state Capitol in Nashville. Inside the GOP-dominant Statehouse, black Democratic lawmakers spoke out against the violence, but also asked their Republican colleagues to not focus solely on the vandalism. Instead, they pleaded with their fellow members to understand what sparked the anger. ""I don't want to walk around angry and in a controlled rage every day, but I want you to understand that if you dismiss their anger and avoid a solution, it will happen again,"" said Rep. Vincent Dixie of Nashville. On Monday evening, more than 60 National Guard troops at the state Capitol put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters. Guardsmen had initially rushed to grab their shields and form a hard line to block the slowly moving crowd -- who were singing and chanting -- from advancing up the Capitol steps. But the crowd remained calm, and Democratic lawmakers leaving the Capitol asked to be able to move past the line of guards to join the crowd. As the crowd continued to sing and call for justice for black Americans, slowly the shields began to drop even as Tennessee state troopers with batons in hand backed away. The majority of the weekend arrests were made in Nashville, where fires were lit inside and outside the city's historic courthouse. Thousands had peacefully rallied outside the state Capitol on Saturday, but demonstrations turned violent after darkness fell. Meanwhile, 30 businesses were vandalized, including a handful of Nashville's famous honky tonks on Broadway. A statue of a former state lawmaker and newspaper publisher Edward Carmack, who espoused racist views, was toppled. That statue was taken Monday to a state museum. Police have since arrested Wesley Somers, 25, and accusing him of setting fire to the building. Law enforcement have asked the public for tips to find others also suspected of causing damage. For the third night in a row, Mayor John Cooper announced Nashville would be under a curfew starting at 10 p.m. Monday and running until 6 a.m. curfew. That comes even though no major demonstrations or clashes between police and protesters took place the day before. In Memphis, Mayor Jim Strickland also imposed a similar 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew for most people, except essential workers and those experiencing a medical issue. The National Guard, which has been in Memphis working on the new coronavirus outbreak response, will be in the city to help local authorities. Strickland said he was on a call this weekend with mayors and police chiefs from 40 cities and curfews were discussed. ""They really felt curfews were needed once there is property damage or some kind of violent act,"" Strickland said. ""We saw that last night."" Memphis Police Director Michael Rallings said he has seen videos of protesters being arrested that are being used by activists to allege police are using excessive force. ""An arrest is never going to be pretty,"" Rallings said. He later noted the department has a ""very elaborate use of force policy"" and the department will deal with officers who transgress that policy. Rallings reported that 10 businesses have been damaged, three officers have been shot at, and 44 protesters have been arrested since Wednesday, when protests began in Memphis. A protest march began Monday evening at the historic Clayborn Temple in downtown Memphis. The temple was the headquarters for the 1968 sanitation workers' strike that brought the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to the city. The demonstrations spreading across America were held around Tennessee over the weekend in response to the latest killings of black people by police. Separate demonstrations were held in Knoxville, Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, but no curfews have been set in place as of Monday. At least 10 arrests were made in Chattanooga on Sunday. According to a spokeswoman, Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke and Police Chief David Roddy ""have agreed that, at this moment in time, instituting a curfew would be unnecessary and practically unenforceable.""",0.0

During a stop in Johnson City to speak to Washington County Federated Republican Women at the Carnegie Hotel, Sethi said he “agreed with President Trump that the looting and the violence was related to Antifa, and applauds the president in declaring the group a terrorist organization.” Many of the recent demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who begged for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pushed his knee against the unarmed man’s neck. A video of the incident went viral last month. Sethi — a trauma surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center — noted that while his “heart goes out” to Floyd’s family, he said the First Amendment does not provide cover for those who engage in violent protest. “Nine-nine percent of police are good people, who put their lives in harm’s way every day,” he said. He faces Bill Hagerty, who has already been endorsed by Trump, in the Aug. 6 Republican Primary to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander. Hagerty released a statement Monday also praising Trump’s comments against Antifa. “America is rooted in the rule of law,” Hagerty said. “We cannot have another night of violence.” Sethi said he would work to “pause all legal immigration” if elected to the Senate. He also vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and told a woman who asked Sethi to explain his position on vaccines that he doesn’t believe the government “has the right to tell you what you can put into your body.” He said those decisions should be left between patients and their doctors. Monday’s meeting of Washington County Federated Republican Women was the first since public gatherings in Tennessee were closed for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in late March. The club also heard from three of the 15 candidates seeking the GOP nomination to succeed retiring U.S. Rep Phil Roe, R-1st. Jay Adkins, and engineer who lives in Elizabethton, said he is an “Iraq veteran and a problem solver.” He said his goal is to “pump fresh water” into what he describes as the “Republican establishment swamp” in Washington, D.C.

Story Highlights Bill Haltom lives and writes in Memphis and Monteagle, Tennessee. In a May 28, 1970, photograph, President Richard Nixon delivers a speech during the Billy Graham East Tennessee Crusade at Neyland Stadium. It was Nixon's first appearance at a college campus since the Kent State shootings earlier in the month. (University of Tennessee Libraries) (Photo: University of Tennessee Libraries) 50 years ago, on the evening of May 28, 1970, 75,000 people packed Neyland Stadium on the campus of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. They did not come there to see a football game. The Tennessee Vols would not kick off their 1970 season for another four months. They did not come to the stadium to hear a concert, although Ethel Waters would sing there that night accompanied by a huge choir from churches across East Tennessee. College football stadiums in the south have often been compared to cathedrals. In a very real sense Neyland Stadium was a cathedral that May evening as thousands came there to hear a preacher. Not just any preacher but the man known as “America’s Preacher,” the famed evangelist Billy Graham. It was the seventh night of a ten-day Graham crusade, and it had been designated “Youth Night.” Dr. Graham would of course preach that night, but he was not the only speaker who would address the crowd from the pulpit on the platform that had been built in the south end zone. The other speaker was the 37th President of the United States, Richard Nixon. President Nixon was a controversial figure on college campuses that spring due to the recent invasion of Cambodia in the expansion of the Vietnam War. Students were protesting on campuses across the country, and earlier that month four students had been shot and killed by National Guardsmen on the campus of Kent State University during such a protest. Billy Graham was a close friend of President Nixon and an ardent supporter of his expansion of the war. Graham sought to have the President as a youth night speaker on the UT campus to demonstrate student support. The UT student body was regarded as very conservative at the time. Indeed Nixon has easily won a mock election on the campus in 1968. Hear more Tennessee Voices:Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought provoking columns. But among the thousands that gathered in the stadium that night were several hundred UT students and faculty members who had come not to worship but to protest the president and America’s expanded war effort In Vietnam and Cambodia. A number of the protesters carried signs that read “THOU SHALT NOT KILL.” Knoxville police confiscated many of the signs. Billy Graham introduced President Nixon, calling the recent invasion of Cambodia “a courageous act,” and the overwhelming majority of the crowd gave him a warm and prolonged ovation. But many of the protesters chanted “Peace!” Others simply stood in silence. The crowd booed the protesters and Ethel Waters lectured them. The evening ended with an altar call as hundreds walked to the end zone as the choir sang the hymn “Just As I Am,” to accept Dr. Graham’s invitation to make a profession of faith. The president flew back to Washington D.C. on Air Force One. The protesters quietly left the stadium. In the days that followed, 47 of the protesters were served with warrants charging them with either disorderly conduct or disrupting a religious service, a rarely prosecuted misdemeanor under Tennessee law. Knoxville police had taken photographs of the protesters and then somehow identified them leading to the arrests. Evangelist Billy Graham, center, and President Richard Nixon, right, survey the capacity crowd of more than 65,000 attending Graham's Crusade at Neyland Stadium on the campus of the University of Tennessee, May 28, 1970. At left is first lady Pat Nixon. ( (Photo: Associated Press) One of those cited and charged in the days following the protests was Dr. Charles Reynolds, a UT Religious Studies professor who would later become the founding editor of the national Journal of Religious Ethics. When President Nixon learned of the citations he publicly asked that the protesters not be prosecuted. Billy Graham issued a statement saying he loved “those young people” although some were being “misled.” The Mayor of Knoxville vowed to pursue every case. Most of the protesters who were charged paid small fines. But Dr. Reynolds appealed his conviction all the way to the United States Supreme Court claiming his silent protest at Neyland Stadium that evening had been an exercise of his First Amendment rights. By a vote of 6-3, the Supreme Court declined to hear his case. In the years that followed politics and religion became more intertwined. Six years after Billy Graham brought Richard Nixon to Knoxville, Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, was elected President openly campaigning on the fact that he was a “Born Again Christian.” Four years later in 1980, Carter was defeated for re-election by Ronald Reagan who was not a member of any church but had the overwhelming support of the new “Religious Right” and the “Moral Majority."" Prior to the 1970s there had been a strong separation of church and state in politics. In 1960 John F. Kennedy, a Roman Catholic, had had to assure voters that the policies he pursued as President would not be dictated by his faith. 20 years later, millions of voters wanted to know the religious beliefs of candidates for public office and would cast their votes as literally matters of faith. That trend grew to the point that American elections are now often decided by religious views as much as political ones.

1623319958,2020-06-02 00:00:00,Wise County protest over George Floyd death draws wide range of people,http://www.timesnews.net/Politics/2020/06/02/Wise-County-protest-over-George-Floyd-death-draws-wide-range-of-people.html,en,False,,653457,Kingsport Times-News,http://www.timesnews.net/,"NORTON — A protest Monday over the death of a Minnesota man last week drew a wide range of Wise County and Norton residents and showed solidarity with local law enforcement agencies. The protestors — about 80 to 100 over the space of two hours, lined Wise-Norton Road near the Walmart shopping center and drew plenty of car horns and yells of support from drivers as the group waved signs against the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Wise resident Alexis Greene, one of the organizers, said the idea and plan for the protest came together over the weekend though social media postings. “Honestly, everyone saw the video and it’s one of those things that just causes this outpour of different emotions in all sorts of different communities,” Greene said of video clips shot by bystanders as Minneapolis Police Department Officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes before Floyd was pronounced dead. “We just want to show our support in Wise,” Greene said. “Even though we’re not a big city, we can still show our support and stand with the rest of the nation.” Asked how she felt about statements from the Trump administration and scenes of rioting in other cities in recent days, Greene said it shows change is needed. “We need leadership that’s going to stand up for the obvious rights that have been deprived from a large group of the community,” Greene said. “We need someone who’s going to stand up for that, and I guess it’s just up to the people to decide who that is.” Wise resident Steve King, who came to the protest with his daughter to see to her safety, gave younger protesters a pep talk before they marched to the roadside. “Do your thing. Change the world. I’ve got confidence in you,” King said. “I believe in social and racial justice and it’s time,” King said before following the group. “It’s time to change this world, it really is, and we can do it through peaceful protest. These kids here are going to change this world and I firmly believe it. Our generation failed them. We failed them big time and we owe it to them to support them and do what we can to help bring about that change.” King said that, despite the four Minneapolis officers seen with Floyd before his death, he supports police. “These guys in blue, I support them 100 percent. They’re the good guys. We have some bad apples that betrayed their profession that gave them a bad name, but they’re stepping up. That’s what we need.” As the protesters lined up on the sidewalk, they began chants of “Peace on the left, justice on the right” and waved signs including references to Floyd’s words to Chauvin before he died: “I can’t breathe.” Norton resident Kimi Berry and her 10-year-old daughter Melanie found themselves at the protest on short notice. “She said, ‘Mommy, I want to go up there,’ ” Berry said of her daughter, “and I said put your shoes on, and here we are. I didn’t even know. She was on her tablet and she said, ‘They’re having a protest at Walmart and I’d like to go.’ ” Berry said that what happened to Floyd struck a nerve with her. “It’s difficult for me,” Berry said.” I have a 16-year-old son, so when I see things like this, it hurts like heck, it really does. There’s nothing that could distinguish him from George Floyd, for example. He’s a young black man, he’s a gentle giant and me and my husband have to teach him differently about police and law enforcement because such things like this happen and it’s awful.” “And that’s why (Melanie) wanted to come,” Berry said. “She wanted to come for her brother and her dad.” Wise resident Cindy Bates and granddaughter Ameera Youmessi came to the protest after hearing about it on social media. “I don’t want to get into politics because I don’t feel that’s what it’s about,” Bates said. “I think it’s about drawing attention to the need for equality and standing beside our brothers and sisters, all of us. It’s not about black against white, it’s not black against police. It’s good against evil, it’s people against injustice, and I want to say that I am very proud of our law officers and I stand behind them and I support them but I don’t support injustice.” Bates said the protest also hit home because she has three biracial children and has lived in a community that has welcomed her family without racism. “I don’t stand for the violence and destruction that’s been going on in our country at all, but I stand with them against injustice because if we love each other we have to share our burdens” Bates said. “In my family, there is no racism and we have never had racism. When you recognize things that maybe you’d rather not think about, you have to stand.” Bates said that all sides need to talk and listen to each other to tackle injustice and racism. “We have to hear the pain of the officers who must be heartbroken with the job they do as they’ve been so misunderstood.” Bates said. “I think for the black person that feels their voice is not heard and the justice system that’s let them down. For the families that don’t know how to teach their children about this ugly part of the world. “ Bates said Monday was the first protest she had ever attended. “I feel very awkward, but I feel like I look back on history when I think about this and all the people who’ve protested for my freedoms, that I’m a woman and I can vote, that we are a free country,” Bates said. “I do believe in making our voice heard in a peaceful and respectful ways.” “I think it’s a very good experience for me and a very good learning process,” Youmessi added. Wise County Sheriff Grant Kilgore watched the protest from across the road, and he said he was impressed with how the group handled it. “We always welcome peaceful, lawful protests,” Kilgore said. “We definitely want them to express themselves and their concerns. This is one of the ways they can petition the government and government officials to make change, and we don’t have a problem with it. This is the way that it’s supposed to be done.” Kilgore said he agreed with the protesters’ sentiment about how Floyd’s arrest was handled. “If we find someone who’s mistreating the public and not being a professional and doing their job the way we feel like it needs to be done, that person’s not going to work for my agency,” Kilgore said. “That much I can assure you. We’re not here to abuse anybody or hurt anybody. That’s just not their job.”",0.0

""Let me be clear: The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese without permission as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde told CNN. ""And to do so... he sanctioned the use of tear gas by police officers in riot gear to clear the church yard. I am outraged,"" Budde said. Budde is the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese Washington, overseeing more than 80 Episcopal congregations, including St. John's. She is the first woman to serve in her position. Follow this story:For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up to get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox Trump had just delivered an address from the Rose Garden Monday evening, pledging to be a ""law and order"" president and calling himself an ally to peaceful protesters. As he spoke, officers used tear gas canisters, rubber bullets and shields to force hundreds of protesters out of Lafayette Park by the White House. They had been peacefully demonstrating for several hours, demanding justice for George Floyd, who died while in police custody after a Minneapolis officer pinned Floyd's neck down with his knee. George Floyd protests rage for seventh night:New York protesters smash windows on Fifth Avenue; National Guard in Chicago, Philadelphia Despite an official D.C. curfew set for 7 p.m. ET, the officers began pushing the crowd out at 6:30 p.m., shortly before Trump's remarks. The president later walked with White House aides to the historical St. John's Episcopal Church, where protesters set fire in the basement on Sunday night. Across from Lafayette Park, St. John's is known as the ""church of presidents"" and has been attended at least once by every president since James Madison. ""It's a Bible,"" Trump told reporters as he held it up for photos outside the boarded-up church. Trump addresses nation:Calling violent protests 'acts of domestic terror,' Trump says he'll send in military if they aren't controlled Trump's visit drew immediate backlash from those who criticized the police's use of force to clear his path to the church for a ""photo op."" ""Were thousands of peaceful protestors just tear gassed so Trump could have a photo op?"" tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, a communications director for former President Barack Obama. Rev. Robert Fisher, of St. John's Church, told Fox News Monday evening that whoever set the fire in the church's basement ""does not represent the majority of people that are out there peacefully protesting with an important message."" He said clergy members were present during the afternoon to hand out water and prayed with protesters, which was ""very hopeful, very peaceful, very loving."" Fisher called Trump's visit ""surreal."" Budde said she and her colleagues were given no notice Trump would be visiting the church, and found out while watching the news. ""The president did not pray when he came to St. John’s, nor … did he acknowledge the agony of our country right now, and in particular, the people of color in our nation who wonder if anyone in public power will ever acknowledge their sacred work, and who are rightfully demanding an end to 400 years of systemic racism and white supremacy in our country,"" Budde said. The Diocese of Washington distances itself ""from the incendiary language of this president,"" Budde said. She said the diocese stands with those protesting racism and police brutality.

1623351814,2020-06-02 04:00:00,Take a moment to listen,https://www.farmprogress.com/commentary/take-moment-listen,en,False,,221000,deltafarmpress.com,http://deltafarmpress.com/,"It was a long weekend, and it’s been a long spring. I was very hesitant to write about this weekend’s violence because, to be honest, I had no idea how to relate it to an agricultural audience. Most of us live far away from places like Philadelphia, New York and Boston. The closest big city to me is Philadelphia, which is roughly two hours away with light traffic. But these aren’t the only places seeing unrest. Harrisburg, Pa., is only 45 minutes from my front door, and there were widespread protests and even some violence there, too. My life experience is very different from most editors on the Farm Progress staff. I am Hispanic and I grew up in an urban area. I only discovered agriculture in my 20s when I was a young journalist covering crime and courts in Maryland. I ended up falling in love with the industry and I can honestly say that I love my job. In all my years of reporting agriculture and working with farmers and agribusiness people alike, I am happy to say that I’ve been treated with nothing but respect. The farming community has been good to me, and I appreciate every single person that I’ve met over the years. But I don’t forget where I came from. I, too, have been the victim of racism. I’ve never experienced it from police, but I know how painful it is to be judged by the color of my skin. I’ve had difficult and uncomfortable conversations with my wife on how to talk about race with our three sons. It’s a difficult subject because I don’t want my sons to be victims of racism. I want people to judge them for who they are, not by the color of their skin or their last name. But as their father, I must prepare them for the ugly truth, and the ugly truth is that racism is still a problem in this country. My office is in my basement, about a mile away from a large dairy farm in eastern Lebanon County. It’s easy for me to insulate myself from what’s going on in the world. Trust me, some days I would rather stay in my basement than go outside. It’s better for my mental health. But I can’t stay quiet; not in this moment. What happened to George Floyd was awful. It goes against everything this country stands for. The people who took the streets in peaceful protests were exercising their constitutional rights, and that’s a right that we should all cherish. But the violence that ensued was just as awful. It doesn’t matter who started it or what reason, violence will not move us forward. Looting stores will not move us forward. All this does is take away from the real issue and puts innocent people in danger. So, what does all this mean for us in rural America? How do we move forward? I don’t have the answers. Nobody does. What I do know, though, is that we as Americans need to listen to each other. If you’re wondering why these people are so angry, ask someone who lives in a city. Ask someone who looks different than you. Be open, be honest, be patient and, most importantly, listen. You might feel like we in agriculture are insulated from what’s going on in the world. Well, we’re not. These are our neighbors, these are our brothers and sisters, and these are our customers. Let’s open our hearts to their grievances. We might not agree on everything, but listening is a good start. Maybe then we can truly start to heal.",0.0

Gov. Gina Raimondo and other state and city officials held a news conference late Tuesday morning to address what happened. She began by reminding the public how proud she was to be a Rhode Islander after seeing and hearing about the peaceful protests held over the weekend. “I stand before you disheartened, dismayed, outraged, and angry at the events that we saw last night right here in the city of Providence,” Raimondo said. “Make no mistake about it, what we saw last night was not a protest, what we saw last night was an organized attack on our community at a time when we are already vulnerable.” (Story continues below.) The governor noted how people showed up armed with crowbars, gasoline, flares and other items to intentionally hurt people and destroy property. Having seen the damage to businesses that are just reopening after being shuttered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Raimondo assured the owners that the state will help get them back on their feet. She also announced she’s activating the R.I. National Guard to assist state and local police in the coming days. Mayor Jorge Elorza announced late Tuesday afternoon that he has issued a citywide curfew beginning Tuesday night. Elorza said the curfew, which will be in place until June 9, will begin at 9 p.m. and end at 6 a.m. “This is not a decision that we take lightly and this is not a decision we make easily,” Elorza said. (Story continues below.) Both Warwick and Cranston have also issued citywide curfews beginning at 8 p.m. after reports of “planned violence” surfaced on social media. Central Falls and Pawtucket soon followed suit – issuing an 8:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, after hearing similar reports about their communities. East Providence also issued a citywide curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. In a statement, the Rhode Island ACLU said called the curfews “an extraordinary and overly broad action that, ironically, can only promote the types of discriminatory police actions that have prompted peaceful protests this past week.” It all started when hundreds of people gathered outside the mall to demand justice for George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died in police custody after an officer kneeled on his neck while he was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe. The incident was captured on video and has since sparked protests around the country. Rhode Island State Police Col. James Manni said he received a tip around dinner time Monday of a “planned disturbance,” calling it a coordinated attack by anarchists trying to come into the city and take it over. As a result of the tip, Elorza said the mall decided to close at 7 p.m. instead of 10 p.m. and city police were on alert. Elorza said even though police were in place ahead of time, the number of people was almost impossible to stop. By 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, throngs of people blocked off Francis Street, meeting a line of officers in the middle. Police continuously tried to clear the area but were met with resistance. (Story continues below.) The situation escalated when they stormed the mall with officers giving chase. People could be seen running toward storefronts on the first floor, looting and causing damage. Officers were seen working hastily to block off the entrances to the mall. Police said about 200 to 300 people were trying to get inside but only about 75 to 100 were successful. More than a dozen businesses inside the mall were looted and vandalized, according to police. The mall had just reopened to customers on Monday after it was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. NEW: Providence Place Mall will be closed through Friday, according to a spokesperson. Tentatively reopening Saturday. — Steph Machado (@StephMachado) June 2, 2020 Police said the looters were not inside the mall for long, since they were able to drive them out toward Cranston Street. In total, Elorza said 65 people were arrested, of which 35 were from Providence, five were from Massachusetts, and the rest were from other Rhode Island cities and towns. (Story continues below.) Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven Paré told Eyewitness News that nine police officers and troopers were injured after bricks were thrown at them. Four were from the Providence Police Department and five were from the Rhode Island State Police. Some of the officers were treated for minor injuries on scene while others declined treatment. Paré said police deployed “less than lethal tear gas” when a large number of people started throwing bricks and other objects at officers. (Story continues below.) Around 1 a.m., people began targeting police cruisers; they could be seen smashing the windshield and windows of one outside the mall before lighting it on fire. Officials said five cruisers were damaged in all, including the one that was set ablaze. The crowd eventually dispersed outside the mall, however, looting and vandalism continued elsewhere in the city. (Story continues below.)

The bishop who oversees St. John's is among the critics. ""He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR's Morning Edition. ""He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation."" ""He did not pray,"" the bishop continued. ""He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate ... represent."" Every president since James Madison has visited St. John's Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday's visit. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" Budde told NPR's Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. ""I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,"" the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John's a few minutes after Washington's just-installed 7 p.m. curfew began. The federal force used against the demonstrators nearly 30 minutes before the curfew began incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""Shameful!"" Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after ""federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,"" the city's police force's job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult. I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!  DC residents — Go home. Be safe — Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC at 7 pm (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020 When the federal force rushed at protesters outside the White House, journalists were also pushed out. Officers attacked Australian reporter Amelia Brace and also hit cameraman Tim Myers, prompting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call for an investigation. The scene played out on live TV, during Australia's breakfast-time Sunrise show. ""While live on air, Myers was struck in the chest by a riot shield and Brace was clubbed with a police baton,"" Australia's 7NEWS reports. ""Our Ambassador should be certainly making representations on behalf of these Australians who effectively been assaulted...for doing their job"" - Leader of the @AustralianLabor Party @AlboMP speaking after @Channel7 journalist & cameraman were hit. https://t.co/rCG56KbYRw #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/CUslYLfYes — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) June 2, 2020 Brace tells Australia's ABC that she repeatedly identified herself as a journalist as officers quickly closed in on them during the rush to clear a path for Trump. ""Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,"" she says. ""We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to ... and then we ended up getting tear-gassed."" The situation, she said, was ""absolutely terrifying."" ""I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we'll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we're feeling perfectly safe,"" Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, ""Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously."" Trump's use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation's capital. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" ""All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,"" Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement. While Budde is thankful to first responders who put out that fire, she says she wants the focus remain on the death of George Floyd and others who have died at the hands of police. ""I want to acknowledge the loss of property, but in no way equate it with the loss of life,"" she said. ""I want to be a church that stands in solidarity with those who are making peaceful protest."" : 6/02/20 An earlier version of this Web story mistakenly said that President Trump walked to St. John's Church nearly 30 minutes before Washington's 7 p.m. curfew began. In fact, he walked there a few minutes after the curfew began.",0.0
1623378677,2020-06-02 07:33:08,"Police, Protesters Take Knee Together At Miller Park",http://www.chattanoogan.com/2020/6/2/409913/Police-Protesters-Take-Knee-Together.aspx,en,False,,663090,Chattanoogan,http://www.chattanoogan.com/Breaking-News/,"Chattanooga Police officers and protesters took a knee together during Monday night’s peaceful demonstration at Miller Park. Captain Jerri Sutton and Deputy Chief Danna Vaughn knelt with protest organizer Marie Mott after police and protesters had spent the better part of half an hour lined up across from one another. “I’ve been in this job a long time, and I can’t say that I know how the African American community feels,” Ms. Vaughn said afterward, “but I understand their frustrations and cries for help, and I would like to be a part of the solution instead of part of the problem.”  Organizer Bria Stevens had previously spoken about a desire to engage in a dialogue with the police department. During the first act of the Miller Park protest, activists mingled among one another as law enforcement stood farther away and guarded the federal courthouse.  “Everyone out here is seated, eating snacks, and yet they have their bulletproof vests on,” said Ms. Stevens. “I would want to tell them that we pay their bills, so we’d like to communicate with them about their hiring processes, how they communicate with the community and how they interact with the community.”  Another speaker, known as Caleb the Poet, asked for the police’s “ears” to be receptive to what the protesters were speaking about.  “We’d like for them to implement the thing they’re listening to out here,” said Caleb. “We know that they hear us every time we come out here and take a stand. So we’d like for them to actually get through what they heard. So we can get to not a hate, not them versus us, but working together to make these streets, communities, and city safer.”  Until the two sides lined up across from one another in front of the courthouse, the proceedings were smooth aside from one incident. An unidentified white man began to play an audio recording of George Floyd’s death, whose passing is what has sparked protests across the nation.  “I would say that if we have any allies, we love everyone just the same,” said Ms. Stevens. “But we would like to respect the dead black and brown bodies to the highest degree. The fact that we can look at videos on Facebook before the police or before their own mothers is atrocious, and the fact that white men continue to play videos lets me know they are not conscious of our trauma.”  When an unidentified white woman and her friend were asked to share their opinion on the demonstration, they simply said “It’s not about us.”  Michael Davis, who was also at last night’s protest, said one desired outcome for the demonstrations is for them to be the impetus behind the creation of a checks and balances system for law enforcement. He also stressed the peaceful nature of the protest when given the microphone on on-stage at Miller Park, and later expanded upon what he said.  “We don’t tolerate people who come here and try to inflict harm or have a selfish agenda to loot or riot for their own selfish gain,” said Mr. Davis. “The Bible says there is a time for peace and a time for war, and a lot of times that gets taken out of context. A war that is fought for selfish intentions is a war that will never be won. This is the time for peace right now, and this is the time to see if the people who are in power who can make changes are going to listen to the peaceful aspect of this.”  On the governmental side of things, Councilwoman Demetrus Coonrod was present throughout. Along with Miller Park guard and former police officer Nathan Cullom (who also took a knee with the other officers), she assisted in keeping affairs calm between protesters and the police.  “They don’t have to be out here because I know where they stand,” said Councilwoman Coonrod about the absence of any other council members or Mayor Berke. “I know where their hearts are, because I know they’re hurting just like everybody else here, and I know from their homes they’re in the protest. I know they’re thinking about ways to change things here in Chattanooga so we can be the model city for other cities.”  2021 mayoral candidate Monty Bruell took time to praise the general conduct of CPD during the last three days of protests, while criticizing Jim Hammond and the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Department. HCSD drew the ire of some when they tear gassed protesters Sunday night.  “I think that the Chattanooga Police Department has exercised restraint,” said Mr. Bruell. “We may not agree with every action they’ve taken in the past, but I think that they have behaved in a professional manner. The Sheriff’s Department’s response, on the other hand, I think has been outrageous. They fired tear gas into a crowd and even gassed the CPD.”  After law enforcement and protesters took a knee, the group of protesters began to March down Lindsey Street into the city around 8:00 , where they split up into smaller groups. Before this occurred, a police officer was overheard saying “If this is all they want to do, then this is fine.”  When Ms. Mott and Caleb the Poet came back to Miller Park, they returned with only a fraction of the people they started with, with the smaller groups walking around the downtown Chattanooga for hours until everyone met back up in Miller Park after sunset.

What would he do? Leonard Draper, the man who convinced Finch to attend Memphis State 50 years ago against the wishes of many in the black community here, and Vickie Finch, the woman Finch loved, were talking about it just the other day on the telephone. “If he was around, knowing him and knowing what kind of heart he had, he would be out there fighting for change,” Draper said. “If I know my friend, he’d be right at the forefront fighting for change. If he was here now, he would be vocal. He’d be like most young black men. He’d be very disturbed with what he’s seeing.” Think about that for a second. It’s been almost 50 years since Finch and Ronnie Robinson and that historic 1972-73 Memphis State basketball team bridged the racial divide in this city just a few years after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It’s a great story. Black and white in this town joined together behind Tigers blue and gray en route to the national championship game. It’s also not good enough anymore. That familiar narrative, that the escape provided by sports unifies us, is only temporary. It’s true here, and it’s true all over this country. The events of the past week only cemented this. Sports can’t just bring us together in FedExForum or Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium for a few hours rooting for the same team anymore. It needs to be an agent of change again. Just like it was when Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in baseball. Just like it was for Jesse Owens and Muhammad Ali and Arthur Ashe. And just like it was for Finch right here in Memphis. Because it’s been almost 50 years and, at least to Draper, the concerning and frightening images playing out across the country are so concerning and frightening because they are so familiar. It’s been almost 50 years, and the police brutality, the racial injustice, the peaceful and powerful protests – and even the folks who are trying to take advantage of and hijacking this moment by looting and setting fire to their own country – they’re still happening just like they were when Finch went from Orange Mound to Memphis State. It’s been almost 50 years, and the institution Finch represented as both a player and coach – an institution that’s so important to this city – is about to build a statue in his honor. But simply commemorating Finch’s legacy isn’t good enough anymore. It’s a good story with an ending that’s no longer good enough. It’s been almost 50 years, and the University of Memphis athletics department currently has just one black head coach for its 18 teams. It’s Penny Hardaway, Finch’s former player. The school’s athletics director and deputy athletics director, each hired over the past year, are white. So is every senior athletics director below them. It’s been almost 50 years, and the Memphis Grizzlies, known for their progressive off-court programs and hiring practices and hosting the NBA's annual MLK Day game, currently have an owner, two new top decision-makers and a new head coach who are all white. It’s been almost 50 years, and the newspaper I write for has never had a black sports columnist. It’s been almost 50 years and just two of the 13 hosts on the major sports talk radio stations in this town, including the one I work for (92.9-FM), are black. These aren’t Memphis sports problems. These are American sports problems that filtered down to Memphis. There aren’t enough black general managers or head coaches in the NFL and NBA. There aren’t enough black administrators or head coaches at colleges around the country. These aren’t comfortable topics to address because our city’s sports institutions are not inherently racist. New University of Memphis athletics director Laird Veatch seems to be a fine hire. Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins looks to be a promising head coach, and Zach Kleiman has proven to be an adept NBA executive. I’d like to think I wasn’t such a bad choice, either. But there’s a pattern, here and throughout the entire country, and ignoring that pattern isn’t good enough anymore. Ignoring racial injustice and police brutality isn’t good enough anymore. Ignoring the reality that we’ve accepted a sports culture, both here and throughout the entire country, in which a majority of our favorite athletes are black and the vast majority of the people in power are white, isn’t good enough anymore. Buy Photo Coach Gene Bartow, Larry Finch (21), Ronnie Robinson (33) and Larry Kenon (35) wait to be interviewed after Memphis State beat Providence in the semifinals of the Final Four in St. Louis in 1973. (Photo: The Commercial Appeal) Even Finch’s story, the one that brought Memphis together and sounds so good, isn’t good enough anymore. So what exactly would Finch say right now? Draper thought back to those days after Finch was unceremoniously let go as Memphis coach in 1997. The community clamored for him to say something negative about the school. Finch never did. “I’m not going to tear down something I helped build up,” Draper recalled him saying. It's why Finch is so beloved here, but it's why the job isn’t done. Not even close. Not in a city with a population that's nearly 65% African-American. Look around at what you’re seeing unfold, at the unrest created by a racial divide that's existed for far longer than 50 years, and it's obvious. We must give pioneers like Larry Finch the ending they deserve. And we can't wait another 50 years for it.

A statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was toppled from its pedestal in front of the namesake high school in Montgomery, Alabama, Monday night. Cheers went up among a small crowd gathered to watch the fallen stone general as cars circled the area and honked. As the statue was driven away, the crowd sang a brief, ""Hey, he-ey, goodbye."" The statue was overturned on a state holiday commemorating Jefferson Davis' birthday. It is one of three Alabama holidays celebrating the Confederacy, a government that rested on the principle of white supremacy. Montgomery Police acknowledged Monday night that people had been arrested in the incident, though didn't offer any other details. ""The statue was damaged and there are suspects in custody. Charges are pending,"" Montgomery Police Captain Saba Coleman said. The Montgomery Public School district announced Tuesday that the statute had been moved to storage. Any decisions about the statue or the name of the school will be left to the school board, said City spokesman Griffith Waller. Monuments in several other Southern cities were the site of protests over the weekend. A statue outside the Tennessee State Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views, was torn down Saturday. Carmack was known for writing editorials attacking fellow Tennessee journalist Ida B. Wells' writings in support of the civil rights movement, including encouraging retaliation against her, resulting in the burning of her Memphis newspaper office. The Robert E. Lee memorial on Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia, was covered in graffiti Saturday night, as was the Stonewall Jackson statute. The headquarters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy was similarly tagged and set on fire, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The Confederate Defenders statute along the Battery in Charleston, South Carolina, was spray-painted. A peaceful protest there the next morning was dispersed, the Post and Courier reported. The brass cast of Charles Linn in Birmingham, Alabama, was left lying on the ground Sunday night, dismantled from its base. Then Monday night, crews with heavy equipment attached straps to the 50-foot-tall obelisk of the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors monument in the same park, working at the direction of Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin to remove the 115-year-old stone memorial. The monument had been at the center of a fight between the city and the Alabama Attorney General's Office, according to AL.com. The city lost a legal battle to have it removed. And it wasn't just monuments. In Fayetteville, North Carolina, a crowd set fire to the Market House, a National Historic Landmark constructed in 1832 on the site of the old statehouse. It was used as a town hall and marketplace and was the site of the sale of slaves. In recent years, the presence of Confederate monuments has come under intense scrutiny. Many were removed after violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017. At the time, protesters in North Carolina toppled a statue of a Confederate soldier near the courthouse in downtown Durham. Statues of two Confederate generals, Robert E. Lee and Albert Sidney Johnston, and the Confederate cabinet member John Reagan, were taken down from the University of Texas. And another four were removed in Louisiana. Floyd's death may spark new calls for additional removals as demonstrations continue. The attorney for George Floyd's family, Benjamin Crump, said Monday that an autopsy commissioned by the family commissioned by the family ""determined that asphyxiation from sustained pressure was the cause"" of Floyd's death from an incident that has sparked protests across the nation. Peaceful protests in some cases gave way to looting as well as violent displays of police aggression as 4,400 people have been arrested, according to a tally by The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) WASHINGTON (AP) — Amid racial unrest across the nation, President Donald Trump on Monday declared himself “the president of law and order” and threatened to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the White House’s idyllic Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Those peaceful demonstrators were cleared so Trump could walk across the park to St. John’s Episcopal Church, known as “The Church of the Presidents,” which suffered fire damage in a protest this week. Holding a Bible, he then stood with several of his Cabinet members as the cameras clicked. “We have the greatest country in the world,” Trump declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” Trump said he would mobilize “thousands and thousands” of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park. The escalation came just after Attorney General William Barr came to the park to to survey the demonstrators. According to senior defense officials, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were being sent to Washington to provide assistance. Those troops were either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people. In extreme cases, however, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, also from the Civil War, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement. The officials said that some of the National Guard in D.C. will be armed and others will not. They said that the D.C. guard members do not have non-lethal weapons. The military police that are visible in the city are members of the Guard. ——————- THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s original story is below. —————————————— President Donald Trump on Monday derided many governors as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations in the aftermath of violent protests in dozens of American cities. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference that also included law enforcement and national security officials, telling the state leaders they “have to get much tougher.” “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” The days of protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations turned violent in several cities, with people trashing stores, smashing and burning police cars and igniting fires in historic Lafayette Park across from the White House. Accused by critics of doing too little to defuse the crisis, Trump was to address the nation early Monday evening. The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again,” said Trump. “We’re doing it in Washington, D.C. We’re going to do something that people haven’t seen before.” The president told the governors they were making themselves “look like fools” for not calling up more of the National Guard as a show for force on city streets. Attorney General Bill Barr, who was also on the call, told governors that a joint terrorist task force would be used to track agitators and urged local officials to “dominate” the streets and control, not react to crowds. He urged the governors to “go after troublemakers.” Trump’s angry exhortations at the nation’s governors came after a Sunday night of escalating violence, images of fires and looting and clashes with police filling the nation’s airwaves and overshadowing the largely peaceful protests. The protests had grown so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground bunker previously used during terrorist attacks. On Monday, Trump also spoke of trying to criminalize flag-burning. The Supreme Court has conservative new members since it last ruled on that issue, and Trump said that “I think it’s time to review that again.” He continued his effort to project strength, using inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks. As cities have burned night after night and images of violence have dominated television coverage, Trump’s advisers have discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president’s own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity. Trump did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to on Monday either. The demonstrations in Washington appeared to catch officers by surprise. They sparked one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service. Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening. Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force. “This isn’t going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,” Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president. In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. The Justice Department deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Related Content Trump wants governors to ‘dominate’ protesters Video",0.0

According to police, officers received a tip that several people were on their way to the store to loot and vandalize it early Monday morning. The store had been closed since 5 p.m. on May 31. When they arrived, they saw two suspects running from the store with stolen items in their possession. They jumped into a white Hyundai Sonata that was driven by Jamal Johnson. All three were stopped and detained by police in the parking lot. Inside the car, officers found clothes, two pairs of Sony headphones and a 32 inch Samsung TV. All of the items still had the stickers on them. Surveillance video inside the Walmart also caught all three suspects stealing the items, police said. Johnson was charged with burglary. The other suspects were not listed in the jail log, meaning they could be juveniles. Related Content City leaders announce curfew for Memphis after protests turn violent Video",0.0

Ralph Northam rejected a request from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to send between 3,000 to 5,000 of the state's national guard to Washington D.C. as part of a massive show of force organized by the Trump administration in response to violent protests, according to Northam's chief of staff, Clark Mercer. Mercer said Trump's comments to governors in a phone call Monday, in which the president said most governors were ""weak"" and needed to ""dominate"" the streets, played a role in the decision. ""The president's remarks to the governors heightened our concerns about how the guard would be used,"" he said. ___ NEW YORK — New York's mayor extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week in hopes of stopping destruction that continued overnight despite the city's efforts to stop protests over George Floyd's death from devolving into lawless mayhem. ""We're going to have a tough few days. We're going to beat it back,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference Tuesday as he announced that an 8 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew would hold through Sunday. The plan came after a night when chaos broke out in midtown Manhattan and the Bronx. On Monday, an 11 p.m. curfew — the city's first in decades — failed to prevent destruction as groups of people smashed their way into shops, including Macy's flagship Manhattan store. Police said nearly 700 people were arrested and several officers were injured during the chaos Monday night and early Tuesday. ___ LAS VEGAS — Separate shootings in Las Vegas during continuing protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have left one man dead and a police officer gravely wounded. Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said Tuesday that the officer was on life support after being shot as police tried to disperse a crowd of protesters outside a Las Vegas strip hotel and casino. Lombardo says the other shooting happened outside a federal building. He says a man was shot by officers several times after he reached for a weapon. The identities of the wounded officer and the fatally shot man have not been made public. ___ STOCKHOLM — More than six thousand people have attended a Sweden-organised online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. The digital ""Sweden in solidarity with Black Lives Matter"" rally Tuesday urged participants to ""check in"" at the Facebook accounts of the U.S. Embassy in Sweden and Nordic neighbors Denmark, Finland and Norway and post photos inspired by the ongoing U.S. events with George Floyd's death. The one hour-long online event with several speakers including poets, activists and politicians was organised by Swedish non-governmental organisations and Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" In his speech, Rashid Musa, head of the Young Muslims of Sweden, called the current situation with African Americans in the United States as ""colonialism 2.0."" ""Malcom X said it best: 'Racism is like a Cadillac, they bring out a new model every year,'"" Musa said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota's attorney general says prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine whether more charges will be filed against officers involved in the death of George Floyd, but they also have to work carefully and methodically. Attorney General Keith Ellison was appointed lead prosecutor in the case Sunday. He told ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday that those who have culpability will be held accountable. Floyd, who was black, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd's neck as Floyd said he couldn't breathe and became motionless. Derek Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But members of Floyd's family and many others are calling for more serious charges, as well as charges against the three other officers who were there. Ellison says despite the widely viewed bystander video of Floyd's final moments, cases against police are hard. He pointed to the deaths of Freddie Gray and Philando Castile, and the beating of Rodney King, as examples of cases where striking video of an incident did not lead to convictions of officers. Ellison did not give a timeline for any new charges. All four officers have been fired. ___ ORLANDO, Fla. — The U.S. Census Bureau says it has temporarily closed offices in several cities as a precaution as cities grapple with unrest following the death of George Floyd. The Bureau would not say Monday which offices have been closed. A spokeswoman says in an email that the closures were done out of an abundance of caution. The Census Bureau is in the middle of the 2020 census, which is attempting to count every resident in the U.S. Census Bureau offices around the country were closed for a month and a half as field operations were suspended in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The offices only began reopening on a rolling basis in the past several weeks. ___ TOPEKA, Kan. — Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly says that bringing the military ""into this contentious moment"" would do more harm than good. Kelly on Monday expressed sympathy for George Floyd's family, families of other people killed by police and people outraged by Floyd's ""tragic murder."" She promised to work to address systemic racism. ""We need our leaders -- myself included -- to listen to those who felt their only means of being heard was to take to the street in protest,"" Kelly said after President Donald Trump threatened to deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests. ""We need action to change the systemic inequalities we have ignored for far too long. We need to stop with the divisive language and instead, come together and do what's right for our state,"" Kelly added. She noted that Kansas protests have been peaceful and promised to work closely with local officials to ensure public safety. ___ WASHINGTON — The streets around the White House complex were shut Tuesday morning, guarded by a mix of Secret Service officers and FBI agents. Overnight, a fence was constructed around Lafayette Park and along 17th St at Pennsylvania Ave, two areas that have been focal points for protests. Work crews were still at work boarding up businesses in the area and attempting to remove graffiti from federal buildings. ___ BUFFALO, N.Y. -- A state trooper who was run over by an SUV that barreled through a group of officers at a George Floyd demonstration in Buffalo broke his leg and shattered his pelvis, police said. Another trooper and a Buffalo police officer were treated for minor injuries after being struck by the Ford Explorer when it broke through a blockade at about 10 p.m. Monday. Troopers were deployed to Buffalo after violence flared downtown this weekend. Officers fired shots at the vehicle before it was apprehended. The driver and a passenger had been shot and were hospitalized with injuries not considered life threatening. A second passenger was uninjured and taken into custody, police said. It was not immediately clear whether the pair in the SUV were wounded by police. Officials in Buffalo initially said they may have been shot at a nearby intersection shortly before the officers were struck. State police say the investigation continues. The unidentified trooper who was run over was treated at a hospital. The other trooper was treated and released for a hand-and-wrist injury. ___ WASHINGTON — A man in the nation's capital said he sheltered about 70 protesters in his home all night after they got caught between police lines after curfew. Rahul Dubey told WJLA-TV he was sitting on his porch around 8:30 p.m. last night when law enforcement officers began corralling protesters on his street. He let some sit with him, and helped others out through his back alley, but the situation then escalated when officers started pushing protesters to the ground and releasing pepper spray, creating a ""human tsunami"" into his home. ""I was hanging on my railing yelling, 'Get in the house! Get in the house!'"" he told The Washington Post. Officers also released pepper-spray through the window after he closed the door, Dubey told WJLA-TV. The protesters inside the home screamed, and started pouring water and milk into their eyes in a scene he described as ""pure mayhem."" One officer came to the door to ask for a piece of the pizza that was delivered to the house overnight as Dubey was on the phone with the TV station, WJLA reported. The protesters left the home after 6 a.m. Tuesday when the district's curfew ended. ___ ST. LOUIS — Police in St. Louis say officers in a marked police car were fired on early Tuesday from a car occupied by suspected looters. The incident led to a chase that ended in the suburb of Jennings, where one of the suspects was shot. Police said the incident was separate from a shooting around midnight Monday in which four St. Louis officers were shot and injured. The Jennings shooting began when officers in a marked police car on the north side of St. Louis who were searching for looting suspects were fired on from men inside a car, police said. That led to a chase that ended in Jennings, just north of St. Louis, when the three suspects bailed out of the car, and one was shot by a St. Louis County officer, police said. One man, identified only as 21 years old, was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries. Police said another man who had been in the car was arrested, and a third escaped. No officers were injured in the Jennings shooting. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Family members of George Floyd are expected to attend a memorial service in his honor Thursday in Minneapolis. The Rev. Al Sharpton is to deliver the eulogy at the service on the campus of North Central University. The civil rights organization Sharpton founded, National Action Network, organized the memorial. The family's attorney, Ben Crump, is also expected to make remarks at the service from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. A Minneapolis police officer was charged last week with third-degree murder in Floyd's death May 25, and three other officers were fired. Bystander video showed the white officer, Derek Chauvin, holding his knee on the neck of the black man while he pleaded for air with his hands handcuffed behind him. ___ WASHINGTON — Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said on CNN on Tuesday it's inappropriate for the military to be used for police work on U.S. streets. ""We don't think that the active duty military should be used on American streets against Americans,"" he said. ""It's an inappropriate use of our military. And we have police in Washington, D.C. We have federal police in Washington, D.C., to focus on the federal properties, and that is an appropriate use. Police have policing power, and bringing in the military to do police work is inappropriate in any state in the United States of America without the consent of the governor, and it would be inappropriate in Washington, D.C."" ___ NEW YORK — An unprecedented curfew in New York City did little to prevent destruction as groups of people smashed their way into shops including Macy's flagship Manhattan store, grabbed merchandise and fled. Police said more than 200 people were arrested and several officers were injured during the chaos Monday night and early Tuesday that followed another day of peaceful protests throughout the city over the death of George Floyd. One officer was struck by a hit-and-run driver in the Bronx and was taken to a hospital in critical condition, police said. Monday was the fourth night in a row of mainly peaceful daytime demonstrations followed by violence and arrests after nightfall. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, both Democrats, announced an 11 p.m. curfew late Monday afternoon. De Blasio said Tuesday's curfew would start earlier — beginning at 8 p.m. and ending at 5 a.m — in an effort to quell late-night violence and destruction. ___ ST. PAUL, Minn. — At least 65 people were arrested at Minnesota's Capitol in St. Paul Monday night for violating a curfew, police said. They gathered peacefully on the Capitol grounds following a march down a St. Paul street. Thousands had gathered earlier in the day at the governor's mansion to demand the arrest and prosecution of all four former police officers involved in the death of George Floyd. In Minneapolis, at the site of Floyd's fatal encounter with police that has become a memorial, the crowd grew slightly agitated awaiting the arrival of police, but there was no widespread property damage. ___ BERLIN — Germany's foreign minister says the peaceful protests in the United States following the death of George Floyd are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" Heiko Maas said in Berlin on Tuesday that his thoughts are with the friends and family of Floyd, who ""lost his life in a truly terrible and shocking way, or one should say it was taken from him."" Maas said that peaceful protests must always be allowed. He added that ""the peaceful protest we are seeing in the United States — with many very moving gestures including by American police officers — this protest is understandable and more than legitimate."" He added: ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States."" Maas also stressed that journalists must be able to do their jobs without risking their safety and criticized violence against them. ___ BRUSSELS — The European Union's top diplomat said Tuesday the death of George Floyd was the result of an abuse of power and that the 27-nation bloc is ""shocked and appalled"" by it. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a white police officer in Minneapolis who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread across America. Borrell says law enforcement officials must not be ""using their capacities in the way that has been used in this very, very unhappy death of George Floyd. This is an abuse of power and this has to be denounced."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" Borrell says ""we trust in the ability of the Americans to come together, to heal as a nation and to address these important issues during these difficult times."" ___ BUDAPEST, Hungary — The Hungarian soccer federation has issued a written reprimand to a player of African origin who showed his undershirt with the words ""Justice for George Floyd"" after scoring for Ferencvaros in its 1-1 draw with Puskas Akademia on Sunday. Tokmac Nguen was born in a refugee camp in Kenya to parents from South Sudan and grew up in Norway. The federation's disciplinary committee said in its ruling issued Monday that any similar actions by Nguen in the future would result in ""actual penalties"" on each occasion. Just hours after Nguen's reprimand, FIFA, the world soccer's governing body urged soccer competition organizers to apply ""common sense"" and consider not sanctioning players demanding justice for Floyd during matches. The German soccer federation is investigating similar actions by four players in the Bundesliga, including American midfielder Weston McKennie, who wore an armband over his Schalke jersey with the handwritten message ""Justice for George."" ___ LAS VEGAS — An officer has been shot in Las Vegas and authorities are responding to another shooting as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said. The officer was shot in the area of the Las Vegas Strip and an officer was involved in a shooting in the downtown area, according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Protesters have been rallying for days across the country over the death of George Floyd, a black man seen on video pleading that he couldn't breathe while a white police officer pressing his knee into his neck for several minutes before he stopped moving. Police in Las Vegas said Monday that 338 people were arrested during three nights of protests. Police said suspects were jailed despite a local court policy calling for most people accused of misdemeanors to receive court summons to prevent the spread of coronavirus. ___ SEOUL — South Korea's Foreign Ministry says it has far confirmed 79 cases of property damage at stores run by Korean Americans amid U.S. protests over the death of George Floyd. The ministry, which held a teleconferencing meeting with diplomats based in the United States to review the demonstrations' impact on Korean Americans and South Korean citizens, said Tuesday it has yet to confirm any injuries or deaths. The ministry says 50 cases of property damage were reported from Philadelphia, 10 from Minneapolis, five form Raleigh and four from Atlanta. ___ SYDNEY — More than 1,000 protesters marched through downtown Sydney on Tuesday in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against the death of George Floyd half a world away. Police escorted a crowd carrying banners that said: ""Black Lives Matter,"" ""Aboriginal Lives Matter,"" ""White Silence is Violence"" and ""We See You, We Hear You, We Stand With You."" The group marched from Hyde Park to New South Wales state Parliament with plans to continue to the U.S. Consulate. The protest proceeded despite some organizers canceling it Monday for fear of conflict with counter protesters. But no counter protest emerged. Around 2,000 demonstrators gathered in Australia's west coast city of Perth on Monday night to peacefully protest Floyd's death, and rallies are planned for other Australian cities this week. Referring to the violence in U.S. streets, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said ""there's no need to import things ... happening in other countries here to Australia."" ___ ST. LOUIS — Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area. The police department tweeted early Tuesday that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots. The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City. On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64. But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. ___ NEW YORK — New York City imposed a late-night curfew Monday that failed to prevent another night of destruction, including arrests after a break-in at the iconic Macy's store on 34th Street, following protests over George Floyd's death. As the 11 p.m. deadline to get off the streets approached, bands of protesters marched peacefully through Manhattan and Brooklyn, but police simultaneously responded to numerous reports of roving groups of people smashing their way into shops and emptying them of merchandise. The doors of Macy's flagship Manhattan store were breached. Police pulled two handcuffed men out and put them in a van. People rushed into a Nike store and carried out armloads of clothing. Near Rockefeller Center, storefront windows were smashed and multiple people arrested. Bank windows were smashed. Wreckage littered the inside of an AT&T store. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop, but instances of vandalism and smash-and-grab thefts mounted as the night deepened. New York joined other cities around the country in imposing a curfew after days of unrest. It comes on top of months of restrictions on public gatherings already imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Enough mayhem happened before the curfew took effect that Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted that it would move up to 8 p.m. Tuesday. The curfew lifts at 5 a.m. ___ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Workers in Alabama's largest city began removing a Confederate monument Monday night after demonstrators failed to knock down the obelisk the night before. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin sent workers with heavy equipment to take down the more than 50-foot-tall Confederate monument made of stone. Late on Monday, after a 7 p.m. curfew took effect and streets were mostly clear, crews began their work. Live video showed workers attaching straps to the peak of the obelisk so it could be lifted away with a crane. Within a few hours they had removed the top of the monument. Woodfin said the city would see if the memorial could be given to a museum or another group. Woodfin said the fine the city may face for violating a state law banning the removal of Confederate and other long-standing monuments is more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Attorney General Steve Marshall, in a statement, said the city would face an assessment of $25,000 if it removed the monument, which has been the subject of a court fight between the mostly black city and Republican-controlled state. ___ CICERO, Ill. — Two people have been killed during unrest in the Chicago suburb of Cicero as protests continued over the death of George Floyd, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania says 60 people were arrested in the town of about 84,000 located west of Chicago. Hanania didn't provide additional information about those killed or the circumstances of their deaths. The Illinois State Police and Cook County Sheriff's Office were called in to help local police Monday as people broke into a liquor store and other businesses and stole items. ___ BUFFALO, N.Y. — A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a George Floyd demonstration Monday night in Buffalo, injuring at least two. Video from the scene shows the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackle a protester on the street and handcuff him. Officers are seen scattering to avoid the SUV as it drives off on Buffalo's east side. Apparent gunshots are heard. The officers were taken to Erie County Medical Center. Authorities said they were in stable condition.",0.0

""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. ""More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that's what the presidency is: the duty to care — to care for all of us."" On Monday evening, Trump walked from the White House across Lafayette Square to hold a Bible in front of St. John's Church, after peaceful protesters were forcefully cleared from the park. (The U.S. Park Police say they used smoke canisters, not tear gas, though it's not clear if another law enforcement agency engaged there used other munitions.) The forceful dispersal began before Washington, D.C.'s curfew had begun, and the bishop overseeing the church has harshly criticized Trump for appearing for photos without praying or addressing the racial issues at the heart of nationwide protests. Trump made the trip after making a speech in which he threatened to deploy the military to states and cities that do not quell violence. ""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it,"" Biden said. ""If he opened it, he could have learned something: that we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump isn't interested in doing that work."" Biden echoed the words spoken by George Floyd, the black man whose death while in custody of Minneapolis police has led to the widespread unrest. The words ""I can't breathe,"" Biden said, ""are a wake-up call for our nation."" Biden addressed police abuses and economic disparities that affect what he called ""communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time"" — alluding to the since-charged police officer who had his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. ""The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism,"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said. He asked Congress to take up measures he called ""a down-payment on what is long overdue,"" including police reform bills outlawing chokeholds, banning the transfer of military weapons to police forces, and establishing a uniform use of force standard. He said he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president. Biden also called for expanding the Affordable Care Act to millions more Americans, saying that Trump, who has long opposed the law, is ""consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to [former President] Barack Obama."" Obama's former vice president reiterated what he's long said on the 2020 campaign trail, that there is a ""battle for the soul of America."" ""Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears,"" Biden said. ""He thinks division helps him.

On Monday, Biden held his first in-person campaign event since the coronavirus took hold in the United States in mid-March. He met with African American faith leaders in Wilmington, Del., listening to at-times critical feedback from the group. Many of the invited guests chided Biden for a political system that has delivered ""hopelessness"" to young African Americans. They told him the Obama administration had not done enough to economically lift black Americans, something Biden then promised would be a centerpiece of any recovery plan from the administration.

Pelosi, reading from Bible scripture at the Capitol, drew on past presidents — including George H.W. Bush speaking in the aftermath of the Rodney King unrest and Barack Obama following the death of Eric Garner — as models of the nation's chief executive at a time of crisis. ""We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many presidents before him to be a healer in chief and not a fanner of the flame,"" Pelosi said. The remarks of the party's highest-ranking official stood in stark contrast to the Republican president as Democrats overwhelmingly criticized the use of force to disperse the crowd of protesters late Monday at the White House so Trump could visit nearby St. John's church in what was widely seen as a campaign photo opportunity. As the world watches a nation in turmoil, Democrats are swiftly preparing investigations and a legislative response to the police violence and racial inequality at the heart of the protests erupting in communities nationwide. ""Some people came out and beat them so they could clear the area so the president could come out and go forward. What is that?"" asked Pelosi. ""That has no place and it's time for us to do away with that."" More than 40 bills — from banning police choke holds and racial profiling to preventing the federal transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement to a long-sought federal anti-lynching law — are now under consideration on Capitol Hill. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called on Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to refuse allowing the use of military helicopters and tear gas on protesters in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. The chairman of a House subcommittee on government operations, Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., sent a letter demanding answers from the Secret Service about its role in what he called an ""unwarranted attack"" on peaceful demonstrators. Connolly said he also is seeking communications related to possible orders given by Trump regarding the use of force against protesters. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said House lawmakers could be recalled to Washington as soon as this month for a vote on legislation to address police violence and confront the inequities facing black Americans. Schumer urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to consider law enforcement reforms legislation by July 4. ""Our nation needs a calm and steady leadership, a sure hand and a big heart, qualities that President Trump has never displayed in office,"" Schumer said as the Senate opened Tuesday. At the partly closed Capitol, a Congress that has already struggled with the COVID-19 outbreak is now confronting a deepening crisis after the death of George Floyd during a police stop in Minnesota. The civil unrest over the death of Floyd at the hands of police combined with the coronavirus pandemic that's disproportionately striking African Americans sparked an urgent plea for understanding from some leaders. Pelosi, a Catholic who regularly attends Mass, said there were so many passages that Trump could have relied on during his visit to the church. He held up a Bible during the event but did not refer to it during brief remarks. She quoted from the book of Ecclesiastes, saying it is a ""time to heal."" ""It is the responsibility of all of us to take the time to heal,"" she said. The Congressional Black Caucus announced a virtual town hall Friday with civil rights leaders, and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler said the panel is planning a hearing next week on policing, officials said. Notably, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for a second day read into the Senate record the names of black people who have died in recent confrontations. George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. As protesters gathered this outside the Capitol, still partly locked down due to the coronavirus, the dual crises tested Washington. There was a shift in tone as even some conservatives who in the past have countered ""Black Lives Matter"" protests with ""Blue Lives Matter"" support for law enforcement acknowledged the concerns. Yet, some Trump allies pushed for a show of military action to quell the protests now stretching into their sixth day. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. He suggested bringing in the 101st Airborne — an elite Army unit — to confront outside agitators influencing the protests. Trump's remarks focusing on the possibility of using the military in response to violent protests, coming as military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters near the White House, were widely criticized. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said: ""These are not the actions of a rationale, fit, democratic president. They are the actions of a man who doesn't respect the core values of our nation."" ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report.",0.0

From smallpox to yellow fever, pandemics have periodically emerged in the city and surrounding country. Cholera struck Knoxville at least three times. Epidemiologists are fond of saying “if you’ve seen a pandemic you have seen one pandemic.” Outbreaks can’t necessarily be compared directly because each disease behaves differently. But choices made by leaders during these outbreaks are comparable. Knoxville's history tells us that leaders can fail to adapt to rapidly evolving pandemics and allow preconceptions to narrow their vision. “Pandemics catch people off guard,” said Susan Lawrence, a medical history professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. “They are a crisis by definition, something that people don’t plan for well.” We mined historic news articles and conducted interviews to find out how Knox County handled outbreaks in the past. Indeed, every outbreak was different. Slowing the spread of Spanish flu In 1918 when Knoxville-based soldiers first started coming down with pandemic flu, local health authorities did not take it seriously. It was the height of World War I and main vectors of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, otherwise known as the Spanish Flu, was actually attributed to movement of American soldiers. Coverage of the Spanish Flu pandemic in the Oct. 19, 1918 issue of the Nashville Tennessean. (Photo: Nashville Tennessean) ""They'd come here on the railroad, get off the station on North Gay Street, right in the middle of town,"" said Laura Still, a local historian and tour guide with the Knoxville History Project. Before COVID-19, Still produced a lecture on local epidemics. These soldiers trained at a base in Chilhowee Park and on the University of Tennessee campus mingled freely in town. What started as a few cases quickly grew. Before long, hospitals were overrun. On Oct.9, Dr. W.R. Cochrane, secretary of the Knoxville Board of Health at the time, took action. Still explained that Cochrane ordered entertainment venues, schools and churches to close. People wore masks in public. Street cars were sterilized. Knoxvillians were encouraged to wash their hands and cover their mouths when they coughed. The police enforced a ban on spitting and publicly lectured people who broke protocols. ""They'd patrol neighborhoods and lecture people who were out there. Just embarrass the heck out of them."" Still said. Coverage of the Spanish Flu pandemic in the Jan. 28, 1920 issue of the Nashville Tennessean. (Photo: Nashville Tennessean) Red Cross nurses wearing face masks escorted soldiers off the train to Chillhowee Park where they were quarantined. Concerned citizens went door to door in the countryside looking for stricken families too sick to care for themselves. The public health measures were enforced until the disease burnt itself out and the public did not protest. The mayor took a back seat to the Board of Health. There was no second wave. But there was one exception to all of these closures - a World War I public war bond auction. Dr. Cochrane, in true wartime spirit, allowed “patriotic” events to continue. At the time, there were over 1,000 cases of pandemic flu in Knoxville. The auction turned into a festival on Gay Street, complete with street performers and music. Thousands of people — young and old, black and white, solider and civilian — were in attendance. Local historian Jack Neely wryly notes, ""As the numbers in the coming days would suggest, patriotism was no protection from the Spanish Flu."" In the weeks after the Liberty Bond Fair, the number of infected would quadruple. By the end of that month, over 10,000 Knoxvillians came down with flu. That's in a city that was, at that time, between 75,000-85,000 people. Parallels to today In many ways, the situation in 1918 is different in Knoxville than it is now. America's economy was propped up by wartime production, meaning pandemic flu did not cause the mass unemployment we're seeing with COVID-19. People were already operating in a wartime frame on the homefront so they complied with government orders. But like pandemic flu, local leaders during the COVID-19 pandemic are left to decide how to act themselves. During the 1918 pandemic, there was no central public health authority like the Centers for Disease Control. Now, the Trump administration has in many ways punted responsibility for COVID-19 to the states. In Tennessee, this means that decision-making power is even more localized due to the patchwork of metro health departments like the Knox County Health Department. How we will fare in the coming months depends on our ability to respond to the evidence in front of us, to align political will with public health. There is ample historical precedence for this beyond Knoxville. Historical cholera, typhus, HIV outbreaks around the world During the 1892 cholera outbreak in Hamburg, Germany, city leaders actively opposed the installation of municipal water filters by Robert Koch, the father of germ theory. They believed state-run sanitation measures were an assault on local autonomy and a threat to the shipping industry. Thousands died while they promoted the ""miasma theory"" of disease as political cover. In the middle of a devastating typhus epidemic in a Prussian-occupied region of Poland, the Prussian government fired medical pioneer and ""father of pathology"" Rudolf Virchow rather than implement any of the sanitation or antipoverty policies he recommended. Virchow identified the squalor, malnutrition and poverty of the Polish people of the region as major factors in the epidemic. He called the epidemic a ""scandal that has become full-blown by the death of thousands."" His prescriptions went beyond the medical and into the political. Virchow would go on to write that “medicine is a social science and politics is nothing more than medicine in larger scale.” This pattern of intractability during epidemics is not borne out of scientific ignorance but politics. It is impossible, for example, to reckon with the HIV pandemic without considering the politics of the Reagan administration. Centers for Disease Control epidemiologist Dr. Don Francis said in an interview with ""Frontline,"" that early in the HIV pandemic the direction from the White House was to “look pretty and do as little as you can.” It was clearly a political nonstarter. A 1918 story in the Nashville Banner details the impact of flu on Tennessee. (Photo: University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine Influenza Encyclopedia) By the end of the 1980s, over 85,000 Americans would die of complications from HIV. Not every political reaction is negative. Sometimes politics aligns with public health. The global collaboration of doctors, governments and humanitarians led by the WHO that eliminated smallpox was a political project as much as it was a scientific one. Public pressure on governments can create the political climate for this kind of realignment to happen. During the HIV pandemic, protesters took over the Food and Drug Administration demanding government action on HIV and a reform of how medical trials are conducted. Those reforms persist to this day. When doctors and leaders get it wrong In 1873, Knoxville was struck by a deadly epidemic of cholera. The first recorded case was a man in his fifties. He was brought to a local doctor with severe vomiting on a June evening. By midnight he had died. Knoxville health officer at that time, Dr. F. K Bailey, wrote in his logs that this was a typical case. The unnamed patient was described as “imprudent in all habits.” In Dr. Baily’s account, the man said to have eaten vegetables “with impunity” and drank whisky daily. At the time, many doctors believed that cholera was a disease of excess, caused by eating too many vegetables, fruits, ice cream or drinking too much alcohol. Consequentially, watermelons and ice cream sales were banned in the city. ""They were still blaming contraband watermelons and people smuggling contraband watermelons."" said Still, ""People were made to feel it was their fault if they got sick."" Contrary to the conventional wisdom of the 1870s, cholera does not spread that way. Vibrio cholera, the bacterium that causes the disease, does not care about the supposed moral failing of eating too much watermelon. Cholera causes vomiting and diarrhea not to punish gluttons but so that it will more easily spread to new hosts. It moves through contaminated waterways, killing thousands. This 1939 Nashville Banner article discusses the 1873 cholera epidemic that killed about 1,000 in one summer. (Photo: Courtesy of Tennessee State Library & Archives) In 1873, germ theory was still relatively new. Many doctors had probably heard of it but not everyone was on board. Robert Koch, the father of germ theory, would not figure out that cholera was caused by bacteria for another decade. But in Knoxville, people were dying. The disease was spreading along the low-lying areas near First and Second Creeks. The Bottoms, a predominantly African-American neighborhood at what now is the James White Parkway, was particularly hard hit. The ordinances outlawing melons were not clearly working. Toward the end of August, Dr. Bailey himself fell ill. He recovered, and the affair may have influenced his thinking. ""He suddenly realized he didn't have to have bad morals to get cholera."" said Still. She explained that Dr. Bailey's notes revealed his prejudices but by the end there was a remarkable shift in attitude toward poorer patients he takes more note of their living conditions. ""He starts to realize somehow the water source is the problem."" Dr. Bailey was vested with nearly unlimited authority on “sanitary measures.” After he fell ill, he used those powers to sterilize local creeks, outhouses and springs with iron sulphate. He ordered ditches and puddles drained and treated with lime. Old, leaky outhouses were sterilized, demolished, buried and replaced. Dr. Bailey enlisted police officers to check cases and assure cleanup. The epidemic abated shortly afterward. There's a broad lesson to Knoxville's third cholera outbreak. The politics of disease can interfere with the public health response. Standard wisdom essentially blamed the poor for their own illness by making it a moral failing. Dr. Bailey was unable intervene effectively until he discarded this ideological baggage. What it means today and into the future It’s fair to argue that Knoxville and Knox County have done comparatively well in getting ahead of our current pandemic. That’s especially when measured against local historical reactions to outbreaks. By acting before hospitals were overwhelmed, we may have avoided a worst-case scenario. The Knoxville-Knox County Phased Reopening Plan grants local leaders substantial flexibility in responding to the pandemic. However, there is clear political pressure for reopening quickly. But history is clear: You cannot cheat a pandemic. While there are many things local authorities cannot control, like test kit shortages, they can and do respond to the evidence in front of them. In 1918 it was understood that pandemic flu spread through crowds and barring a disastrous exception, crowds were forbidden from gathering. By the end of the 1873 cholera breakout, health officials knew the disease spread through the water so they did what they could to clean up. History shows that in order to deal with a pandemic and save lives, all local officials must act on the best available scientific evidence.

1623456850,2020-05-31 17:22:14,Exclusive: Nashville police looking for 20-30 people they say drove violence during Saturday protest,http://rssfeeds.knoxnews.com/~/625707858/0/knoxville/home/~Exclusive-Nashville-police-looking-for-people-they-say-drove-violence-during-Saturday-protest/,en,False,,607964,Shopper News,https://www.knoxnews.com/shopper-news/,"On Sunday, as the city confronted shattered remnants of a peaceful protest overtaken by violence, Nashville police tried to identify 20-30 people they said hijacked the demonstration and used it “as a cover for the destruction they wanted to employ.” Police Chief Steve Anderson said the vast majority of more than 1,000 protesters at a Saturday demonstration against police brutality and racism remained peaceful. Video footage from the Central Precinct and the Metro Courthouse in downtown Nashville showed isolated agitators leading the violence, destruction and arson. Photos and video from the Nashvilleprotest showed people dressed in all black with backpacks moving through the crowd that gathered to protest the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes. Other photos show unidentified individuals breaking windows and starting fires inside the Metro Courthouse. Many of the people seen vandalizing buildings appeared to be white.

(Photo: Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean) Anderson said police detectives were working to identify the people they believed to be insurgents. Police are establishing a dedicated email to collect tips about the protest. People can send information, photos and videos to NashvilleArsonInvestigation2020@nashville.gov. Anderson did not know if any of the isolated agitators were among the 28 people arrested during and after the protest. Most of the people taken into custody Saturday were charged with relatively minor misdemeanor violations such as disorderly conduct. None are charged in connection with the arson at the courthouse. Eleven of the arrestees were white. Sixteen were black. Three had out-of-state addresses, according to police. Gov. Bill Lee on Sunday said state authorities had ""reason to believe that many of those involved in unlawful acts are not Tennesseans."" The state Department of Safety and Homeland Security is launching an investigation into the matter along with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and other agencies. President Donald Trump on Sunday connected left-wing activist movement antifa with violence overtaking protests in multiple cities. In a tweet, he said the United States government would label the group a terrorist organization. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is active globally, including in Tennessee. The loosely affiliated groups frequently advocate for anti-racist policies, though often via an anarchist and militant approach. The police chief did not say if organized groups might have been behind the violence in Nashville. Spokesman Don Aaron said police suspected antifa and white supremacist groups could have been involved, although he said it was too soon to know for sure. Local prosecutors are working with police as the investigation moves forward. “We have a lot of work to do to identify individuals and determine their motives,” Nashville District Attorney Glenn Funk said. “Arson is a very serious crime.” Police also are collaborating with federal authorities as they continue to investigate. U.S. Attorney Don Cochran, who handles federal prosecutions in Middle Tennessee, met with officers Saturday. The feds are focusing on anyone who might have crossed state lines to participate in violent protests. Demonstration mirrored peaceful protests for most of the day Nashville, a hub of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, has seen a wave of protests over the past few years as activists spoke out against police officers killing black people — nationwide and here at home. Anderson said much of Saturday's demonstration, which began with a rally at Legislative Plaza and continued with a march through the city, mirrored peaceful Black Lives Matter protests in the past. Protesters have called police violence an outgrowth of systemic racism embedded in many facets of policing and American life. When protesters took to Nashville streets in 2014 after a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, local police officers handed out hot chocolate and set up rolling roadblocks. Protests bubbled up again in 2018 after white Nashville police officer Andrew Delke, 26, shot and killed Daniel Hambrick, who was black, as he was running away during a foot pursuit. Those protests remained largely peaceful. “Every previous march we’ve had, for the very most part, was people trying to express their thoughts, their ideas,” Anderson said. “That’s exactly what they did yesterday. But there was an element in the crowd that had other thoughts in mind.""

(Photo: Larry McCormack/ The Tennessean) When chaos erupted, Anderson said, “only a small number were actually involved in defacing, setting fires, breaking windows or damaging cars.” “This was a peaceful gathering, a very peaceful march through downtown,"" Anderson said. “Then people within that group, using it as a cover, became the criminals that we’re seeking to identify at this point."" Lee called in the National Guard to assist police at Mayor John Cooper's request. State forces are expected to continue collaborating with local law enforcement moving forward. Anderson believed the ""attack on the courthouse,"" which included multiple fires, break-ins and vandalism, was premeditated. “That was a planned attack,” he said. “There was an organized effort and then they may have gathered up a following as they went along."" Police wearing riot gear lined the courthouse after fires became visible, lobbing cans of tear gas into the crowd and asking demonstrators to disperse. “It wasn’t until the arson attack on the courthouse that I authorized chemical spray,"" Anderson said. “When there’s a fire we've got to get the fire department in there and they’ve got to be safe.” Anderson said a heightened police presence would be planned downtown in the coming days. Activists at the heart of the peaceful rally and march said their message should not be lost while law enforcement pieces together the details of the day. They said the Community Oversight Board, a civilian panel that investigates allegations of police misconduct, should be further empowered to root out corruption in the police department. Organizers have criticized Anderson and the police department for failing to cooperate with the board. Progress will require more commitment to and investment in institutions focused on eliminating racism and discrimination at every level of government, said Jamel Campbell-Gooch, deputy director of the nonprofit Gideon’s Army and vice chair of the Community Oversight Board. “There are things we can be reaching for locally right now,” Campbell-Gooch said. “It’s time. All the changes they want to see needs to be invested by the mayor’s office to actually stop violence.” Yihyun Jeong and Natalie Allison contributed to this report.

1623456842,2020-06-02 05:00:30,Past pandemics in Knoxville have led to stark political choices — with deadly consequences,http://rssfeeds.knoxnews.com/~/625848644/0/knoxville/home/~Past-pandemics-in-Knoxville-have-led-to-stark-political-choices-%e2%80%94-with-deadly-consequences/,en,False,,607964,Shopper News,https://www.knoxnews.com/shopper-news/,"COVID-19 is not Knoxville's first pandemic. From smallpox to yellow fever, pandemics have periodically emerged in the city and surrounding country. Cholera struck Knoxville at least three times. Epidemiologists are fond of saying “if you’ve seen a pandemic you have seen one pandemic.” Outbreaks can’t necessarily be compared directly because each disease behaves differently. But choices made by leaders during these outbreaks are comparable. Knoxville's history tells us that leaders can fail to adapt to rapidly evolving pandemics and allow preconceptions to narrow their vision. “Pandemics catch people off guard,” said Susan Lawrence, a medical history professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. “They are a crisis by definition, something that people don’t plan for well.” We mined historic news articles and conducted interviews to find out how Knox County handled outbreaks in the past. Indeed, every outbreak was different. Slowing the spread of Spanish flu In 1918 when Knoxville-based soldiers first started coming down with pandemic flu, local health authorities did not take it seriously. It was the height of World War I and main vectors of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, otherwise known as the Spanish Flu, was actually attributed to movement of American soldiers. Coverage of the Spanish Flu pandemic in the Oct. 19, 1918 issue of the Nashville Tennessean. (Photo: Nashville Tennessean) ""They'd come here on the railroad, get off the station on North Gay Street, right in the middle of town,"" said Laura Still, a local historian and tour guide with the Knoxville History Project. Before COVID-19, Still produced a lecture on local epidemics. These soldiers trained at a base in Chilhowee Park and on the University of Tennessee campus mingled freely in town. What started as a few cases quickly grew. Before long, hospitals were overrun. On Oct.9, Dr. W.R. Cochrane, secretary of the Knoxville Board of Health at the time, took action. Still explained that Cochrane ordered entertainment venues, schools and churches to close. People wore masks in public. Street cars were sterilized. Knoxvillians were encouraged to wash their hands and cover their mouths when they coughed. The police enforced a ban on spitting and publicly lectured people who broke protocols. ""They'd patrol neighborhoods and lecture people who were out there. Just embarrass the heck out of them."" Still said. Coverage of the Spanish Flu pandemic in the Jan. 28, 1920 issue of the Nashville Tennessean. (Photo: Nashville Tennessean) Red Cross nurses wearing face masks escorted soldiers off the train to Chillhowee Park where they were quarantined. Concerned citizens went door to door in the countryside looking for stricken families too sick to care for themselves. The public health measures were enforced until the disease burnt itself out and the public did not protest. The mayor took a back seat to the Board of Health. There was no second wave. But there was one exception to all of these closures - a World War I public war bond auction. Dr. Cochrane, in true wartime spirit, allowed “patriotic” events to continue. At the time, there were over 1,000 cases of pandemic flu in Knoxville. The auction turned into a festival on Gay Street, complete with street performers and music. Thousands of people — young and old, black and white, solider and civilian — were in attendance. Local historian Jack Neely wryly notes, ""As the numbers in the coming days would suggest, patriotism was no protection from the Spanish Flu."" In the weeks after the Liberty Bond Fair, the number of infected would quadruple. By the end of that month, over 10,000 Knoxvillians came down with flu. That's in a city that was, at that time, between 75,000-85,000 people. Parallels to today In many ways, the situation in 1918 is different in Knoxville than it is now. America's economy was propped up by wartime production, meaning pandemic flu did not cause the mass unemployment we're seeing with COVID-19. People were already operating in a wartime frame on the homefront so they complied with government orders. But like pandemic flu, local leaders during the COVID-19 pandemic are left to decide how to act themselves. During the 1918 pandemic, there was no central public health authority like the Centers for Disease Control. Now, the Trump administration has in many ways punted responsibility for COVID-19 to the states. In Tennessee, this means that decision-making power is even more localized due to the patchwork of metro health departments like the Knox County Health Department. How we will fare in the coming months depends on our ability to respond to the evidence in front of us, to align political will with public health. There is ample historical precedence for this beyond Knoxville. Historical cholera, typhus, HIV outbreaks around the world During the 1892 cholera outbreak in Hamburg, Germany, city leaders actively opposed the installation of municipal water filters by Robert Koch, the father of germ theory. They believed state-run sanitation measures were an assault on local autonomy and a threat to the shipping industry. Thousands died while they promoted the ""miasma theory"" of disease as political cover. In the middle of a devastating typhus epidemic in a Prussian-occupied region of Poland, the Prussian government fired medical pioneer and ""father of pathology"" Rudolf Virchow rather than implement any of the sanitation or antipoverty policies he recommended. Virchow identified the squalor, malnutrition and poverty of the Polish people of the region as major factors in the epidemic. He called the epidemic a ""scandal that has become full-blown by the death of thousands."" His prescriptions went beyond the medical and into the political. Virchow would go on to write that “medicine is a social science and politics is nothing more than medicine in larger scale.” This pattern of intractability during epidemics is not borne out of scientific ignorance but politics. It is impossible, for example, to reckon with the HIV pandemic without considering the politics of the Reagan administration. Centers for Disease Control epidemiologist Dr. Don Francis said in an interview with ""Frontline,"" that early in the HIV pandemic the direction from the White House was to “look pretty and do as little as you can.” It was clearly a political nonstarter. A 1918 story in the Nashville Banner details the impact of flu on Tennessee. (Photo: University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine Influenza Encyclopedia) By the end of the 1980s, over 85,000 Americans would die of complications from HIV. Not every political reaction is negative. Sometimes politics aligns with public health. The global collaboration of doctors, governments and humanitarians led by the WHO that eliminated smallpox was a political project as much as it was a scientific one. Public pressure on governments can create the political climate for this kind of realignment to happen. During the HIV pandemic, protesters took over the Food and Drug Administration demanding government action on HIV and a reform of how medical trials are conducted. Those reforms persist to this day. When doctors and leaders get it wrong In 1873, Knoxville was struck by a deadly epidemic of cholera. The first recorded case was a man in his fifties. He was brought to a local doctor with severe vomiting on a June evening. By midnight he had died. Knoxville health officer at that time, Dr. F. K Bailey, wrote in his logs that this was a typical case. The unnamed patient was described as “imprudent in all habits.” In Dr. Baily’s account, the man said to have eaten vegetables “with impunity” and drank whisky daily. At the time, many doctors believed that cholera was a disease of excess, caused by eating too many vegetables, fruits, ice cream or drinking too much alcohol. Consequentially, watermelons and ice cream sales were banned in the city. ""They were still blaming contraband watermelons and people smuggling contraband watermelons."" said Still, ""People were made to feel it was their fault if they got sick."" Contrary to the conventional wisdom of the 1870s, cholera does not spread that way. Vibrio cholera, the bacterium that causes the disease, does not care about the supposed moral failing of eating too much watermelon. Cholera causes vomiting and diarrhea not to punish gluttons but so that it will more easily spread to new hosts. It moves through contaminated waterways, killing thousands. This 1939 Nashville Banner article discusses the 1873 cholera epidemic that killed about 1,000 in one summer. (Photo: Courtesy of Tennessee State Library & Archives) In 1873, germ theory was still relatively new. Many doctors had probably heard of it but not everyone was on board. Robert Koch, the father of germ theory, would not figure out that cholera was caused by bacteria for another decade. But in Knoxville, people were dying. The disease was spreading along the low-lying areas near First and Second Creeks. The Bottoms, a predominantly African-American neighborhood at what now is the James White Parkway, was particularly hard hit. The ordinances outlawing melons were not clearly working. Toward the end of August, Dr. Bailey himself fell ill. He recovered, and the affair may have influenced his thinking. ""He suddenly realized he didn't have to have bad morals to get cholera."" said Still. She explained that Dr. Bailey's notes revealed his prejudices but by the end there was a remarkable shift in attitude toward poorer patients he takes more note of their living conditions. ""He starts to realize somehow the water source is the problem."" Dr. Bailey was vested with nearly unlimited authority on “sanitary measures.” After he fell ill, he used those powers to sterilize local creeks, outhouses and springs with iron sulphate. He ordered ditches and puddles drained and treated with lime. Old, leaky outhouses were sterilized, demolished, buried and replaced. Dr. Bailey enlisted police officers to check cases and assure cleanup. The epidemic abated shortly afterward. There's a broad lesson to Knoxville's third cholera outbreak. The politics of disease can interfere with the public health response. Standard wisdom essentially blamed the poor for their own illness by making it a moral failing. Dr. Bailey was unable intervene effectively until he discarded this ideological baggage. What it means today and into the future It’s fair to argue that Knoxville and Knox County have done comparatively well in getting ahead of our current pandemic. That’s especially when measured against local historical reactions to outbreaks. By acting before hospitals were overwhelmed, we may have avoided a worst-case scenario. The Knoxville-Knox County Phased Reopening Plan grants local leaders substantial flexibility in responding to the pandemic. However, there is clear political pressure for reopening quickly. But history is clear: You cannot cheat a pandemic. While there are many things local authorities cannot control, like test kit shortages, they can and do respond to the evidence in front of them. In 1918 it was understood that pandemic flu spread through crowds and barring a disastrous exception, crowds were forbidden from gathering. By the end of the 1873 cholera breakout, health officials knew the disease spread through the water so they did what they could to clean up. History shows that in order to deal with a pandemic and save lives, all local officials must act on the best available scientific evidence.

Video by Chris Juhn/Zenger The previous night had seen mostly peaceful protests that drew an estimated 4,000 people to the streets. Looters emptied a liquor store, and tear gas canisters flew as demonstrators broke squad car windows. Twenty-four hours later furious orange flames pockmarked the city blocks surrounding the Third Police Precinct where Officer Derek Chauvin was based. The white patrolman killed George Floyd, a black man, during an arrest Monday night over an accusation of retail forgery. Chauvin was a 19-year police veteran whose career has been pockmarked with other allegations of excessive force including three shootings. One was fatal. As his past percolated through local and national news media, the protests turned more violent. Fires consumed an auto parts store, a Wendy’s restaurants and an affordable housing complex that was expected to house hundreds. Sprinkler systems saved at least two grocery stores from burning to the ground, but other businesses were at the mercy of the flames. Looters stripped bare what wasn’t consumed by fire, laying waste to both corner shope and cavernous Target stores. Reports circulated of business owners pacing rooftops with loaded shotguns. Widely seen video footage showed Chauvin kneeling on the 46-year-old Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes as he complained that he couldn’t breathe and pleaded for his life. Floyd lost consciousness at the scene, and was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. The FBI and law enforcement agencies in Minnesota have launched investigations. The city of Minneapolis fired Chauvin and three other officers. Mayor Jacob Frey called for criminal charges on Wednesday, hours before the riots escalated. “Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” he asked. “We cannot turn a blind eye. It is on us as leaders to see this for what it is and call it what it is.” Some protesters made their way to Chauvin’s home on Wednesday, scrawling the word “murderer” on his driveway in chalk. Others wrote “I can’t breathe” in red spray paint, the words Floyd is heard saying on the video of his last conscious moments.",0.0

The first night of demonstrations in Asheville on Sunday caused the shutdown of interstate traffic, but were less violent and destructive than many other protests happening around the nation that have included the shooting of officers and at least one death. On Monday night, Asheville protesters did not march but the intensity ramped up with guns brandished and fired and more property damage near the city center. Monday night, other law enforcement agencies, including North Carolina State Troopers, stood in a line outside of the department, facing protesters who were chanting ""black lives matter"" and asking police to take a knee.

At that point, police used the tear gas without first telling protesters to disperse, Norris said.

Participants say they were peaceful Hours before the protest began, President Donald Trump used federal troops to forcibly remove protesters from a church near the White House as he gave a speech declaring himself the “president of law and order.” Earlier in the day, the Hennepin (Minnesota) County Medical Examiner ruled Floyd’s death a homicide and that his heart stopped while he was restrained by officers with a knee on his neck. Video of the arrest has caused nationwide unrest that has inspired protests nationwide.

They were arrested early Tuesday after hours of peaceful protesting turned tense, when protesters refused officers’ orders to move from the intersection of West State of Franklin Road and University Parkway. City officers, Washington County sheriff’s deputies, Greeneville City officers and state police advanced on the protesters to make arrests and donned gas masks to suggest the use of tear gas. In the Johnson City Police Department narrative included with the arrest report, written by officer F. Holder, he wrote protesters continued to block the lanes after police asked them multiple times to move to the sidewalk. Carpenter was charged with the weapon violation when an employee at the Washington County Detention Center reported finding a loaded .40-caliber pistol in his backpack. According to the report, he does not have a valid handgun carry permit. Officers also said they found an outstanding arrest warrants for him charging him with aggravated burglary and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Mayor McFarland speaks on coronavirus and protest Story Highlights Sheriff's deputies encountered protesters who marched to Sheriff's Office and jail Monday. Murfreesboro Mayor Shane McFarland praises officers' response to protests. Jail reported May 20 having kitchen contract worker and inmate testing positive for coronavirus. Coronavirus cases at jail rose to seven inmates by May 26. Three Rutherford County Jail employees have tested positive for the coronavirus, and inmate infections tripled to 21 within a week, a spokeswoman confirmed Tuesday. ""The employees are quarantined at home,"" spokeswoman Lisa Marchesoni said. ""The inmates are being quarantined in a separate area away from other inmates."" The rise in cases has occurred at a time when deputies are encountering protesters upset about the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The protests include a peaceful group that marched Monday to the grounds of the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office and jail at 940 New Salem Highway.

Fouche was released Monday. (Photo: HELEN COMER/DNJ) Marchesoni reported May 26 that the jail had seven inmates test positive for the coronavirus. No employees at that time tested positive. Prior to the May 26 cases, Marchesoni reported May 20 that a jail kitchen contract worker tested positive for the coronavirus after being admitted to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. The worker has recovered. An inmate who worked in the kitchen also tested positive and is one of the 21 cases involving only male inmates. ""It still appears the virus spread from the same source,"" Marchesoni said, adding that the jail has 679 inmates. ""Everyone has been tested. None of the women inmates tested positive for COVID-19."" Mayor McFarland speaks on virus Because the sheriff's office must comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 regulations, ""we cannot release the names of the employees or contract employee,"" who tested positive, Marchesoni said. The medical staff at the jail routinely screens inmates before they are booked. All inmates being booked into the jail are being quarantined for 14 days, Marchesoni said in a May 6 email to The Daily News Journal. The rise in jail cases comes when Rutherford County had 1,243 coronavirus cases and 23 deaths as of Monday, according to the Tennessee Department of Health. The county also had 11,861 negative tests and 512 people recovered from the coronavirus, Murfreesboro Mayor Shane McFarland told listeners on a Monday night TV broadcast. ""Our prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones during this pandemic,"" McFarland said. The county had spikes in cases in early and late May, but most days have shown a flat trend in increases, McFarland said. ""The numbers that we see are still trending downward,"" and ""are headed in the right direction,"" the mayor said. McFarland also talked about how soccer and baseball leagues have returned to fields. The city's indoor pools are open for structured lap swimming, and Parks and Recreation staff are monitoring conditions to determine when the outdoor Boro Beach pool and playgrounds can reopen, the mayor said. Mayor praises protest response McFarland also talked about the recent protests. He urged people to have more understanding, be kinder and show love a little more. The mayor praised the way officers carried out a plan Sunday to protect the city from violence while honoring the First Amendment rights of protesters. The police had a respectful rapport with the marchers who went around the Square. Officers also showed calm while guarding the entrance to the city's police headquarters on Highland Avenue while protesters insulted them, McFarland said. The mayor said the police use of tear gas at East Main Street and Middle Tennessee Boulevard was necessary because protesters there were blocking the intersection in unsafe ways, including the use of cars, while headed to Forrest Hall at Middle Tennessee State University. The hall's name honors controversial Civil War Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest. Police warned people to move out of the intersection before using tear gas, the mayor said. The city also had officers enforce a 6:30 p.m. Sunday night curfew to ensure safety from potential riots that have harmed other cities, McFarland said.

Mariann Budde “outraged.” Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington D.C., spoke with CNN shortly after the photo-op, saying, “Let me be clear, the president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus.” President Trump had just addressed the nation, calling himself “your president of law and order” and vowing to “dominate the streets.” Video showed officers in protective gear forcibly removing a large crowd of peaceful demonstrators from the area between the White House and the church. “(Trump) sanctioned the use of tear gas by police officers in riot gear to clear the church yard,” Budde said. “I am outraged. The president did not pray when he came to St. John’s, nor … did he acknowledge the agony of our country right now.” Trump, flanked by members of his administration, held the Bible before cameras as he posed in front of the boarded-up church across from the White House. Budde said Trump failed in particular to address the suffering of “the people of color in our nation, who wonder if anyone ever – anyone in public power will ever acknowledge their sacred words – and who are rightfully demanding an end to 400 years of systemic racism and supremacy in our country.”",0.0

WASHINGTON — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to ""dominate the streets."" In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy's flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: ""People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they're going to be like, 'Damn, we don't want them out here doing this ... again.'"" The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd's brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer's condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy ""thousands and thousands"" of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. ""The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,"" she said. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump's threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy National Guard units. The president was not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. For nearly a week since Floyd's death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. ""We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don't deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to ""dominate the streets,"" the U.S. military will step in to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" the president declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

U.S. stock indexes are moving higher in early trading Tuesday, following broad gains in global markets as investors hope that the gradual lifting of coronavirus lockdown mandates will put economies ravaged by the outbreak on the path to recovery. The S&P 500 was up 0.4%, adding to gains from the day before. Financial, industrial and other stocks that would stand to benefit the most from a growing economy moved higher. Energy companies also rose as the price of crude oil headed higher. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. The modest gains have the S&P 500 on track for a three-day winning streak, extending the benchmark index's remarkable two-month rally off a steep skid in February and March as broad swaths of the U.S. economy ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Wall Street's momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, spurring threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 189 points, or 0.7%, to 25,668. The Nasdaq composite was up 0.2%. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains in the early going. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.8%. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early Tuesday to kick off trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. In Europe, France's CAC 40 jumped 2.1% Tuesday as the country opened restaurants, cafes, parks and beaches and launched a contract tracing app to help keep tabs on new contagions. Germany's DAX, which had been closed Monday, caught up with previous global markets' gains and surged 3.7%. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.9%. Markets in Asia closed broadly higher. While more countries and sectors are reopening, activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. And fears persist about a possible resurgence in coronavirus outbreaks in some countries. There were 34 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on Tuesday, seeming to reaffirm growing risks as people begin to mingle more in crowded commuter trains with the reopenings of more offices, schools, restaurants and stores. The daily numbers had dropped below 20 recently. Bond yields were mostly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.67% from 0.66% late Monday. Oil prices rose.

The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you; you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" ""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard."" ""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly."" Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal."" ""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way."" In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The base of a massive Confederate monument in Alabama's largest city was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. Workers hired by the city of Birmingham began removing the top portion of the 115-year-old monument from Linn Park late Monday. By daybreak, the pedestal was the only thing left, covered with graffiti and pock marks from protests against police brutality. Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in a racist church bombing that killed three other black girls in the city in 1963, came to see the remains. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the sight. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long. It's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph. She was seriously injured in the blast at 16th Street Baptist Church, and testified against Ku Klux Klansmen who were convicted in the killings. Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by the death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Now even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham finally took action about a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Live video from overnight showed a flatbed truck hauling off the stone pieces in the early morning hours. It's unclear where they were being taken. Crews were expected to return later Tuesday to finish the job, a city official said. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state. Alabama authorities said Birmingham would face a $25,000 assessment for violating a state law that bans the removal of such monuments. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the fine would be much more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Work to remove the monument began on Monday, which happened to be Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in on the steps of the state Capitol in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him, news outlets reported. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city's only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled ""Appomattox,"" it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying ""Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving.""",0.0

A statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was toppled from its pedestal in front of the namesake high school in Montgomery, Alabama, Monday night. Cheers went up among a small crowd gathered to watch the fallen stone general as cars circled the area and honked. As the statue was driven away, the crowd sang a brief, ""Hey, he-ey, goodbye."" The statue was overturned on a state holiday commemorating Jefferson Davis' birthday. It is one of three Alabama holidays celebrating the Confederacy, a government that rested on the principle of white supremacy. Montgomery Police acknowledged Monday night that people had been arrested in the incident, though didn't offer any other details. ""The statue was damaged and there are suspects in custody. Charges are pending,"" Montgomery Police Captain Saba Coleman said. The Montgomery Public School district announced Tuesday that the statute had been moved to storage. Any decisions about the statue or the name of the school will be left to the school board, said City spokesman Griffith Waller. Monuments in several other Southern cities were the site of protests over the weekend. A statue outside the Tennessee State Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views, was torn down Saturday. Carmack was known for writing editorials attacking fellow Tennessee journalist Ida B. Wells' writings in support of the civil rights movement, including encouraging retaliation against her, resulting in the burning of her Memphis newspaper office. The Robert E. Lee memorial on Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia, was covered in graffiti Saturday night, as was the Stonewall Jackson statute. The headquarters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy was similarly tagged and set on fire, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The Confederate Defenders statute along the Battery in Charleston, South Carolina, was spray-painted. A peaceful protest there the next morning was dispersed, the Post and Courier reported. The brass cast of Charles Linn in Birmingham, Alabama, was left lying on the ground Sunday night, dismantled from its base. Then Monday night, crews with heavy equipment attached straps to the 50-foot-tall obelisk of the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors monument in the same park, working at the direction of Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin to remove the 115-year-old stone memorial. The monument had been at the center of a fight between the city and the Alabama Attorney General's Office, according to AL.com. The city lost a legal battle to have it removed. And it wasn't just monuments. In Fayetteville, North Carolina, a crowd set fire to the Market House, a National Historic Landmark constructed in 1832 on the site of the old statehouse. It was used as a town hall and marketplace and was the site of the sale of slaves. In recent years, the presence of Confederate monuments has come under intense scrutiny. Many were removed after violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017. At the time, protesters in North Carolina toppled a statue of a Confederate soldier near the courthouse in downtown Durham. Statues of two Confederate generals, Robert E. Lee and Albert Sidney Johnston, and the Confederate cabinet member John Reagan, were taken down from the University of Texas. And another four were removed in Louisiana. Floyd's death may spark new calls for additional removals as demonstrations continue. The attorney for George Floyd's family, Benjamin Crump, said Monday that an autopsy commissioned by the family commissioned by the family ""determined that asphyxiation from sustained pressure was the cause"" of Floyd's death from an incident that has sparked protests across the nation. Peaceful protests in some cases gave way to looting as well as violent displays of police aggression as 4,400 people have been arrested, according to a tally by The Associated Press.

1623506624,2020-06-02 13:01:07,Washington archbishop denounces Trump visit to Catholic shrine as 'baffling' and 'reprehensible',https://www.oakridger.com/zz/news/20200602/washington-archbishop-denounces-trump-visit-to-catholic-shrine-as-baffling-and-reprehensible?rssfeed=true,en,False,,152402,oakridger.com,http://oakridger.com/,"WASHINGTON – A day after a much-criticized photo op at a fire-damaged church near the White House, President Donald Trump took his anti-protester ""law and order"" message to a Catholic shrine, a visit that drew swift condemnation from a top church official. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

1623506562,2020-06-02 06:08:00,What We're Reading About The Past Week Of Protests,https://www.wknofm.org/post/what-were-reading-about-past-week-protests,en,False,,90047,wknofm.org,http://wknofm.org/#spider,"If you've been trying to keep up with news about the nationwide protests against police brutality, the stream of stories can be overwhelming. In the days following George Floyd's homicide at the hands of Minneapolis police, reporters have been covering the protests in more than 140 cities across the country, trying to make sense of this tumultuous moment. Here are some of the most illuminating stories that we've read this week to help us understand how we got here, and the larger issues driving the protests. Minneapolis in context This is hardly the first time that Minneapolis has erupted into protests about police brutality and the killings of black people. In 2016, people took to the streets after police shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in a nearby suburb, Falcon Heights. And in 2015, Minneapolis police shot and killed Jamar Clark, which ignited two weeks of protests. In The Boston Review, Elizabeth Stinton relates the current protests in Minneapolis to the ones that followed the deaths of Clark and Castile. She also looks at the nationwide unrest that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Similar to the uprisings that took place over half a century ago, she writes, Minneapolis residents are fed up with the ""buildup of unanswered grievances and the lack of concrete changes to their immediate living conditions."" ""Rather than responding to violent political rebellion with policy—such as addressing mass unemployment, failing public schools, and inhumane housing conditions—policymakers and officials, from Richard Nixon's War on Crime to the bipartisan War on Drugs to Donald Trump's embrace of 'Law and Order' politics, have consistently sought to manage the material consequences of socioeconomic problems (e.g., urban decay and drug abuse) with more police, more surveillance, and, eventually, more incarceration. We as a nation still fail to reckon with the wisdom King prophetically offered toward the end of his life: that only 'social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention. There is no other answer. Constructive social change will bring certain tranquility; evasions will merely encourage turmoil.'"" Policing Over at Slate, Joel Anderson writes that while many police chiefs are condemning the excessive use of force by the police officer who killed Floyd, it's important to pay attention to what police are doing during protests: ""The initial response of police leaders may have felt like progress, but video footage of police and protesters clashing in the streets reveals the truth: Officers are much closer to what we see in viral videos documenting their brutality than in the well-intentioned words of their leaders. Despite the shift in public statements, police haven't changed since the protests of 2014 and 2015."" Many protesters, including journalists, have captured police on tape pointing guns, shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at them. Michael Dessam compiled a list at Slate of the ways police incited violence: ""Police all over the country tear-gassed protesters, drove vehicles through crowds, opened fire with nonlethal rounds on journalists or people on their own property, and in at least one instance, pushed over an elderly man who was walking away with a cane."" Existing while black The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging during the protests, and as we've reported, black people are dying from the virus at disproportionate rates. And as Annelisa Merelli at Quartz writes, police brutality is also a public health crisis that affects black people at a much higher rate than others: ""To give a sense of the magnitude of the crisis, the APHA reported that in 2016 alone (the latest year for which the organization could get reliable data, in itself a telling sign of the lack of priority accorded to the issue) at least 1,019 people were killed due to police intervention, and 76,440 were injured. This resulted in nearly 55,000 years of life lost, and had a large price tag, too: Police brutality costs $1.8 billion per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control's most recently available data (2010)."" Many argue that these two crises for the black community—police brutality and the coronavirus—aren't independent of each other. In fact, in both cases the extent of the death toll stems from systematic discrimination, and in both cases, the solution may require a deep rethinking of the overall system. In The Atlantic, Ibram X. Kendi examines a 1896 document by a statistician that says black people were naturally selected for disease and death, and would gradually become extinct. Kendi goes on to write that ""too many Americans have been waiting for black extinction since Hoffman,"" and that black Americans are ""living in a nightmare"" rather than the elusive American Dream: ""A nightmare is essentially a horror story of danger, but it is not wholly a horror story. Black people experience joy, love, peace, safety. But as in any horror story, those unforgettable moments of toil, terror, and trauma have made danger essential to the black experience in racist America. What one black American experiences, many black Americans experience. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the toil and terror and trauma of other black Americans. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the souls of the dead. Because they know: They could have been them; they are them. Because they know it is dangerous to be black in America, because racist Americans see blacks as dangerous."" Stories of solidarity Our NPR colleague Leila Fadel wrote about a Somali immigrant, Safia Munye, who opened a restaurant in Minneapolis more than two years ago—only to close her doors due to COVID-19. However, the community rallied behind her business and raised more than $180,000 to re-open this weekend—that is, until it was burned down during the protests. But despite her loss, Munye says she wants justice for George Floyd and change for Minneapolis. ""'My heart is broken. My mind is broken,' she says. 'I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice.'"" And The New York Times brought us another story about resilience and solidarity, about a Bangaldeshi family in Minneapolis who also lost their restaurant after it was burned down during one of the protests. Yet they support the uprising, and even opened the restaurant's doors as a medical haven for protesters. "" 'We were just trying to do what we could to help our community,' said [Hafsa] Islam, who helped treat wounded protesters. 'Sure, we had our business. Sure, we were trying to keep our kitchen open. But more than anything, we were concerned for our people.' ""The tension in [Ruhel] Islam's adopted city reminds him of his childhood in Bangladesh, when he lived through a dictatorship. Two of his fellow students were killed by the police, he said. 'We grew up in a traumatic police state, so I am familiar with this type of situation,' he said.""

1623506559,2020-06-02 06:15:00,Tuesday's Primaries: Races To Watch And Live Results,https://www.wknofm.org/post/tuesdays-primaries-races-watch-and-live-results,en,False,,90047,wknofm.org,http://wknofm.org/#spider,"With everything going in the country — from the unrest in many cities after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police to the coronavirus pandemic — it's easy to have missed that elections are being held. But several states and the District of Columbia have primaries up and down the ballot: Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail by one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He went into the day 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to get. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote, with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary, with its 186 delegates). Rep. Steve King on the ropes. The controversial Iowa conservative faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who has painted King as ineffective in the House, given that he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. Former state Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face either state Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks or ex-Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling, who moved to Iowa in 2017. Miller-Meeks got the backing of Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, have backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces a challenge from the left. A veteran lawmaker from Maryland's 5th Congressional District and No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, Hoyer faces a progressive primary challenge from 29-year-old Mckayla Wilkes. Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment has remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He has outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET Loading... Spy games in New Mexico. The announced retirement of New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall set off a domino effect. Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Luján declared for Udall's Senate seat, leaving open his seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Enter: Valerie Plame, the ex-CIA agent. She has raised and spent more than any candidate in this race and gained national attention with her glossy campaign ad showing her racing backward in a Chevy Camaro on a dusty road. But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take on Torres Small this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It has been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase has outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... Senate matchups to be set in Iowa and Montana. Democrats are hoping to take back the Senate this fall. They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired Adm. Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach who has spent the second most — $1.4 million — on this primary. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... When Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock changed his mind and decided to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, it suddenly put this race on the map for Democrats in a big way. Three other Democrats are on the ballot Tuesday, but Bullock has been expected to win easily, raising more than 10 times what his next opponent has. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Indiana openings. The retirements of moderate Democrat Pete Visclosky in Indiana's 1st District and Republican Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in Congress, in the 5th District has opened up both of these ideologically divergent seats. More than half a dozen Democrats are competing in the 1st District, which is suburban and exurban Chicago, a place that went for Hillary Clinton with 54% of the vote in 2016. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET Loading... In the 5th District, a handful of Republicans have duked it out, including state Sen. Victoria Spartz, who raised and spent the most and got the backing of the Club for Growth, and Beth Henderson, a local businesswoman with the endorsement of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun. Democrats have rallied around one candidate, Christina Hale. This district has been in GOP hands for a long time, but it could be one to watch this fall. The Cook Political Report lists it as only ""lean Republican."" Trump won it with 53% in 2016.

Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful. But looting and vandalism in some areas along Van Nuys Boulevard prompted a response from officers, who fired bean bags. Authorities also responded to a fire at a strip mall, according to the Los Angeles Times. San Francisco Bay Area Some 15,000 people marched peacefully in downtown Oakland, according to a police spokesperson quoted in the East Bay Times. Most dispersed prior to the start of the city's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. More than 40 people were arrested for violating the curfew, according to the Oakland Police Department. The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said. Police said some protesters had vandalized a handful of vehicles, according to NPR member station KQED. More than a dozen San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions have imposed curfews in the wake of protests sparked by Floyd's death. Corrections: 6/02/20 A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that 15,000 people marched on Interstate 680 in Walnut Creek, Calif., and were dispersed by police. The correct figure is several hundred. The march by 15,000 people was peaceful and took place in Oakland, Calif.",0.0

By the time Memphis hit its 10 p.m. curfew last night, the crowds of peaceful protesters had mostly dispersed, leaving Downtown streets eerily calm after five nights of unrest. No journalists were shoved or protesters tackled by officers. No tear gas was fired into unsuspecting crowds. No evildoers used the protests as cover to break windows and loot stores. By those measures, the city's curfew — issued Monday by Mayor Jim Strickland after 31 protesters were arrested during Sunday night's protests — was a success. And the worries that curfews across the country could escalate conflicts between law enforcement and protesters weren't sustained— at least, not in Memphis, not last night.

Before they got there, protesters stopped for a prayer at Beale and B.B. King: “We’re out here right now … thanking you for Memphis right now, thanking you for the state of Tennessee right now, all these marches that are going on all over this country, black and white have come together like never before,” prayed the Rev. Charles Johnson, a Memphis pastor. “We thank you, God, for bringing us together.” There was also a ""rolling protest"" that slowed traffic on the Interstate 40 bridge, which protesters had tried to march onto the night before only to be repelled by officers: So here’s some video from the end of another rolling bridge slowdown, this time westbound on the Hernando de Soto Bridge. A handful of cars kept traffic moving about 10-15 mph most of the way over, right until this moment. pic.twitter.com/kD7G8rmRLo — Katherine Burgess〽️ (@KathsBurgess) June 2, 2020 What comes after Memphis protests?

(Photo: Ariel Cobbert/ The Commercial Appeal) The lull in action made space for a deeper discussion about what protesters hope to accomplish through the protests. The Coalition of Concerned Citizens, one of two major organizers of the protests (and a consistent thorn in Strickland's side), yesterday asked for Memphis police to make two structural changes, per our Micaela Watts. The requests: give officers better mental health resources (to put them in a better frame of mind for dealing with crises) and more training in de-escalation and intervention. The coalition's two requests are eminently reasonable, especially now. The militaristic mindset that pervades police departments across the country isn't sustainable or helpful — and Black Lives Matter has shown it never really was, not for everybody. The Humpty Dumpty of modern, military-style policing seems to be plummeting downward. And good riddance. When policing a community becomes a ""war,"" something is wrong, something broken. And usually what is broken is the community itself — like Memphis, which is groaning and travailing in so many heart-rending ways. Memphis' war on crime is a war on itself. Memphis is playing Whack-a-Mole with crime while feeding the machine more tokens in the form of poverty, lack of education, and lack of moral structure, to name a few of the city's many issues. The trick isn't to get a bigger, deadlier hammer; it's to stop putting tokens in the machine, to address those deeper problems, both personal and systemic. The coalition's requests are a good place to start. Speaking of curfews: Despite not having any protests, Germantown also ordered a curfew last night — y'know, just to be on the safe side — our Ted Evanoff reports. Mayor calls for another investigation Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland is calling once again for an investigation, this time after video showed police officers forcefully tackling a woman at a protest early Sunday. Here's the video, taken by our Desiree Stennett, who also wrote the follow-up story: I tried to send this earlier but couldn’t in the chaos. A Memphis police officer is yelling “Somebody get her. Somebody get the girl in the gray hoodie.”  Then they swarm. pic.twitter.com/MlJ5y8YYbs — Desiree Stennett 〽️ (@Desi_Stennett) May 31, 2020 The woman arrested was 29-year-old Victoria Jones, the founder of The Collective, a nonprofit in Orange Mound featuring the work of black artists. Van Turner, Shelby County commissioner and president of the Memphis branch of the NAACP, said Jones will have legal representation through the NAACP and the Black Lives Matter Bail Fund, our Katherine Burgess reports. Here's Turner on that decision: “We can’t just allow this moment to go past us and nothing occur,"" Turner said. ""We have to embrace the protest.” Earlier, Strickland had similarly called for an investigation after a video emerged of a woman who was violently shoved by an officer in riot gear. Got a mask from SCHD? Don't use it For a while now, the Shelby County Health Department has been distributing black re-usable face masks the state commissioned from sock-maker Renfro Corp. But if you've picked up a mask, you should probably stop wearing it for now. That's because the masks have been treated with a chemical called Silvadur, an ""anti-microbial agent applied to fabrics to reduce the growth of odor-causing bacteria,"" per the Health Department. But Silvadur is also registered as a pesticide, according to a report from Nashville's WTVF NewsChannel 5, which quoted an environmental toxicology professor as saying, ""I wouldn't wear one."" Since the report, Tennessee and health departments across the state, including Shelby County's, have stopped distributing the masks and warned others not to, our Micaela Watts reports. The masks were already controversial — partly because the state signed a contract with Renfro without shopping around, but also because the efficacy of the masks has been questioned by some Democrats (although the masks seem to work just fine).

The bishop who oversees St. John's is among the critics. ""He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR's Morning Edition. ""He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation."" ""He did not pray,"" the bishop continued. ""He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate ... represent."" Every president since James Madison has visited St. John's Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday's visit. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" Budde told NPR's Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. ""I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,"" the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John's a few minutes after Washington's just-installed 7 p.m. curfew began. The federal force used against the demonstrators nearly 30 minutes before the curfew began incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""Shameful!"" Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after ""federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,"" the city's police force's job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult. I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!  DC residents — Go home. Be safe — Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC at 11 pm (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020 When the federal force rushed at protesters outside the White House, journalists were also pushed out. Officers attacked Australian reporter Amelia Brace and also hit cameraman Tim Myers, prompting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call for an investigation. The scene played out on live TV, during Australia's breakfast-time Sunrise show. ""While live on air, Myers was struck in the chest by a riot shield and Brace was clubbed with a police baton,"" Australia's 7NEWS reports. ""Our Ambassador should be certainly making representations on behalf of these Australians who effectively been assaulted...for doing their job"" - Leader of the @AustralianLabor Party @AlboMP speaking after @Channel7 journalist & cameraman were hit. https://t.co/rCG56KbYRw #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/CUslYLfYes — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) June 2, 2020 Brace tells Australia's ABC that she repeatedly identified herself as a journalist as officers quickly closed in on them during the rush to clear a path for Trump. ""Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,"" she says. ""We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to ... and then we ended up getting tear-gassed."" The situation, she said, was ""absolutely terrifying."" ""I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we'll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we're feeling perfectly safe,"" Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, ""Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously."" Trump's use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation's capital. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" ""All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,"" Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement. While Budde is thankful to first responders who put out that fire, she says she wants the focus remain on the death of George Floyd and others who have died at the hands of police. ""I want to acknowledge the loss of property, but in no way equate it with the loss of life,"" she said. ""I want to be a church that stands in solidarity with those who are making peaceful protest."" : 6/02/20 An earlier version of this Web story mistakenly said that President Trump walked to St. John's Church nearly 30 minutes before Washington's 7 p.m. curfew began. In fact, he walked there a few minutes after the curfew began.",0.0
1623506533,2020-06-02 11:58:00,'He Thinks Division Helps Him': Biden Condemns Trump's Protest Response,https://www.wknofm.org/post/he-thinks-division-helps-him-biden-condemns-trumps-protest-response,en,False,,90047,wknofm.org,http://wknofm.org/#spider,"Updated at 11:46 a.m. ET Former Vice President Joe Biden condemned both police violence and President Trump's increasingly confrontational response to widespread unrest in a Tuesday morning speech delivered at Philadelphia City Hall. ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. ""More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that's what the presidency is: the duty to care — to care for all of us."" On Monday evening, Trump walked from the White House across Lafayette Square to hold a Bible in front of St. John's Church, after peaceful protesters were forcibly cleared from the park. (The U.S. Park Police say they used smoke canisters, not tear gas, though it's not clear if another law enforcement agency engaged there used other munitions.) The forceful dispersal began before the Washington, D.C., curfew had begun, and the bishop overseeing the church has harshly criticized Trump for appearing for photos without praying or addressing the racial issues at the heart of nationwide protests. Trump made the trip after making a speech in which he threatened to deploy the military to states and cities that do not quell violence. ""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it,"" Biden said. ""If he opened it, he could have learned something: that we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump isn't interested in doing that work."" Biden echoed the words spoken by George Floyd, the black man whose death while in custody of Minneapolis police has led to the widespread unrest. The words ""I can't breathe,"" Biden said, ""are a wake-up call for our nation."" Biden addressed police abuses and economic disparities that affect what he called ""communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time"" — alluding to the since-charged police officer who had his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. ""The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism,"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said. He asked Congress to take up measures he called ""a down payment on what is long overdue,"" including police reform bills outlawing chokeholds, banning the transfer of military weapons to police forces and establishing a uniform use of force standard. He said he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president. Biden also called for expanding the Affordable Care Act to millions more Americans, saying that Trump, who has long opposed the law, is ""consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to [former President] Barack Obama."" Obama's former vice president reiterated what he has long said on the 2020 campaign trail, that there is a ""battle for the soul of America."" ""Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears,"" Biden said. ""He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being that he leads. ""The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either,"" Biden said. ""But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate."" In a statement following his remarks, Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign adviser, said Biden has ""obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy."" She added: ""Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has used the politics of racial division when they suited his needs and he is doing it again."" On Monday, Biden held his first in-person campaign event since the coronavirus took hold in the United States in mid-March. He met with African American faith leaders in Wilmington, Del., listening to at-times critical feedback from the group. Many of the invited guests chided Biden for a political system that has delivered ""hopelessness"" to young African Americans. They told him the Obama administration had not done enough to economically lift black Americans, something Biden then promised would be a centerpiece of any recovery plan from the administration.

PARIS — Thousands of French protesters defied a virus-related police ban and rallied Tuesday against racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics, as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Clapping, cheering and waving signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Police Everywhere, Justice Nowhere,"" the largely young, multiracial crowd streamed to the main Paris courthouse and rallied peacefully while police monitored closely from nearby corners. Earlier, thousands marched in Sydney, Australia's largest city, chanting ""I can't breathe,"" and expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. ""When you refuse to treat the problem of racism ... it leads to what we see in the United States,"" said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. ""The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France."" Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America -- and now, beyond. Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited by the police for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France as part of virus confinement measures. But the Paris protest plans drew attention online, and demonstrators showed up anyway. Similar demonstrations were held in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics -- and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn't matter if it's about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,"" she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia's highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country's indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.""",0.0

The official mobilization order was issued Tuesday morning. ""These soldiers are expected to mobilize immediately and they are moving to their respective readiness centers now,"" Holmes said during a press conference on Tuesday. The general said the Tennessee guardsmen are expected to be in the DC region no later than Saturday. Holmes did not say how many Tennessee guardsmen would be deployed to Washington, but did say it would not affect local missions.

""We have 12,000 Army and Air National Guardsmen and every one of them is ready and trained."" Gov. Bill Lee said he was comfortable sending our troops after seeing how our troops came together with protesters on Monday night in downtown Nashville. ""The National Guard put down their shields and those protesters did not advance that’s an expression of mutual trust,"" Lee said. ""I think what you saw last night was an example of disciplined, well-trained units,"" said Holmes. ""I think that's the actual model of what right looks like."" Tennessee National Guardsmen put down their shields during peaceful rally at state capitol NASHVILLE, TN (WSMV) - A peaceful vigil produced a powerful moment between protesters and National Guard members Monday night. Politics aside, the governor said he was happy to see conversations happening this weekend after protests in trying to bridge racial divides. “I say that we need to have listening ears and we need to have hearts that are bent on reconciliation and not destruction,” Lee said. Several guard members have been deployed to Nashville and other larger cities to help with protest that have turned violence. Lee said the violence is under investigation. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mike Stewart is calling on the governor to reject the call by the president to send the National Guard to D.C. Stewart said he should follow other governors lead. “Governor Lee should follow the example of other governors and reject President Trump’s request for Tennessee National Guard troops to be sent to Washington DC. Inflammatory statements by Trump and others in his administration demonstrate that his request for Tennessee’s support is designed to serve improper political ends. It has long been a bedrock principle of our democracy that the military is separate from our politics, here to protect our democratic system, not participate in it. Statements by President Trump and Secretary of Defense Esper show a complete disregard for these core American principles. President Trump has stated that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was “in charge” of operations against protesting Americans and said that he “will deploy the United States military” to States at his discretion. Esper told the nation’s governors that “[w]e need to dominate the battlespace.” Such statements are an almost incomprehensible departure from our national traditions. Protests by citizens are not a “battlespace.” No officer in our regular military forces should be “in charge” of actions against Americans; to the extent that a small number of persons engage in vandalism or other illegal activities, that should be a matter for state and local authorities. As we have seen in Nashville, the vast majority of citizens speaking out, protesting and marching in the wake of George Floyd’s tragic death have been peaceful and formed an essential part of our national discussion. Trump Administration statements show that the effort to call up troops is not a response to any real national threat but a politically motivated effort to further polarize our nation. Our Tennessee National Guard soldiers have performed heroic duty oversees for many years, protecting us at great risk to themselves. That is the sort of mission for which they are properly deployed; we should not permit them to be used as part of any Administration’s political maneuvering.”",0.0

The first night of demonstrations in Asheville on Sunday caused the shutdown of interstate traffic, but were less violent and destructive than many other protests happening around the nation that have included the shooting of officers and at least one death. On Monday night, Asheville protesters did not march but the intensity ramped up with guns brandished and fired and more property damage near the city center. Monday night, other law enforcement agencies, including North Carolina State Troopers, stood in a line outside of the department, facing protesters who were chanting ""black lives matter"" and asking police to take a knee. More: Asheville police ask other agencies for help prior to Monday protest But after hours of peaceful protest, the night ended in a series of tear gas canisters and eventually gunfire. This is the second consecutive night that protesters in Asheville have been met with tear gas. On Sunday, what protester Maria Norris described as a friendly march escorted by police turned when the protesters walked onto the Jeff Bowen bridge. At that point, police used the tear gas without first telling protesters to disperse, Norris said. As the peaceful protest deteriorated on Monday, the confederate monument dedicated to Zebulon Vance was vandalized. More: Why did Asheville officers first fire tear gas at protest? Participants say they were peaceful Hours before the protest began, President Donald Trump used federal troops to forcibly remove protesters from a church near the White House as he gave a speech declaring himself the “president of law and order.” Earlier in the day, the Hennepin (Minnesota) County Medical Examiner ruled Floyd’s death a homicide and that his heart stopped while he was restrained by officers with a knee on his neck. Video of the arrest has caused nationwide unrest that has inspired protests nationwide.

By the time the workers paused Tuesday morning, little was left of a spire that had become a lightning rod for controversy in recent years and a focal point for local protesters outraged by George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis. On Sunday, the obelisk — known formally as the Confederate Sailors and Soldiers monument — was the site of a speech from Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, who pleaded with the crowd. Some protesters had already vandalized the obelisk and toppled another statue in the park, this one of the former Confederate officer Charles Linn. Woodfin asked that they refrain from trying to tear down the much larger monument — so that his government could do it instead. ""Allow me to finish the job for you,"" the mayor told a crowd behind his mask and a megaphone. And he persuaded them to give him until midday Tuesday to pull the monument down. ""I wanted you to hear it directly from me. But I need you to stand down."" On Monday, Woodfin declared a state of emergency and implemented a curfew for the city, citing the protests from the night before, during which the police arrested at least two dozen people. Birmingham isn't the only city reckoning with its Confederate past in the wake of Floyd's death. Since the release of a video showing the black man's arrest in Minneapolis, during which a white officer plants a knee on Floyd's neck, protesters in several cities and towns below the Mason-Dixon line have directed their frustration — and sometimes their vandalism — toward their local Confederate monuments. In Alexandria, Va., a statue commemorating Confederate soldiers came down Tuesday morning. It was removed a month earlier than scheduled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy due to fears of vandalism, according to The Washington Post. Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving. pic.twitter.com/CZTjlOkpfT — Justin Wilson (@justindotnet) June 2, 2020 This likely isn't the final chapter in the Birmingham monument's story, which was knotty well before the latest spasm of unrest trained attentions back on it. Woodfin's predecessor, William Bell, ordered the memorial partly hidden with plywood screens in 2017, in the wake of the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued the city for violating a state law passed that same year, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act, which protects against the relocation or alteration of Confederate symbols that have been up for more than four decades. A unanimous state Supreme Court decision last fall sided with the monument's supporters, bringing the plywood down and assessing a fine of $25,000 against Birmingham. Now, Marshall has threatened another lawsuit over the city's move. ""Should the City of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today,"" ,"" the attorney general said in a statement issued Monday, ""city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the [Alabama Memorial Preservation] Act to pursue a new civil complaint against the City.""

On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee begins the first of a planned series of hearings on the origins of the FBI's 2016 Russia investigation into possible ties with the Trump campaign. Republicans are particularly interested in the decision-making inside the Obama-Biden administration. Further, the Senate Homeland Security Committee late last month approved a subpoena along party lines for Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. ""The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the U.S. who is currently trying to be president got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $80,000 a month,"" said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, accused the committee's chairman, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., of abusing his power to aid Trump. ""We're in the middle of the worst public health and economic crisis in a century,"" he said, ""and what is Senator Johnson focused on? Running a political errand for Donald Trump by wasting Homeland Security Committee time and resources attempting to resurrect a craven, previously-debunked smear against Vice President Biden."" It is the allegation at the heart of Trump's impeachment — the president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and conspiracy theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and in December 2019, Trump was impeached for abuse of power by the House of Representatives for making the ask. The Senate acquitted the president in February after a contentious trial. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans using the Senate to try to help get Trump reelected. ""There are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee's attention but instead this committee is doing the president's personal bidding,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a potential contender to be Biden's running mate. During the first Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, senators will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., plans to subpoena 53 individuals, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former director of national intelligence James Clapper — all frequent Trump political targets. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had generally avoided weighing in on these investigations, but he fully embraced them in a recent Senate floor speech. ""No matter what some Washington Democrats may try to claim, you are not crazy or a conspiracy theorist if you see a pattern of institutional unfairness towards this president. You would have to be blind not to see one,"" he said. Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley, who testified against Trump's impeachment in the House, said investigations can be political and still have merit. ""I certainly believe that the oversight interests are stronger when you're looking at things like the Russia investigation. The Burisma controversy presents a more challenging question, however, I tend to favor some inquiry."" As vulnerable House Democrats experienced during impeachment, high-profile partisan inquiries can spark political backlash when voters have more urgent concerns — like the pandemic, the economy and social unrest. Graham was quick to announce last Friday that the Senate Judiciary Committee would also hold a hearing on police use of force. Democratic strategist Scott Mulhauser is a former Biden aide, and a former Senate aide. He said Senate Republicans — who are fighting to hold their majority this November — could be making a political blunder. ""It's an overreach here, an overplay of your hand with these hearings. Taking your eye off the ball is a mistake that could cost careers."" Graham says he would like to issue a committee report by October, ahead of Election Day. ",0.0

Sethi, a Nashville trauma surgeon, said his candidacy all starts with his mother and father, who legally immigrated to the U.S. from India. ""When my parents were kids, their homes were burned to the ground by Muslim radicals,"" Sethi told the group at its North Eastman Road headquarters. ""They were left with noting. ... They went to the U.S. Embassy. They stood in line. They waited their turn. They came to this country legally with an 'L.' "" Sethi insisted the COVID-19 pandemic shows why the U.S. is entirely too reliant on the communist Chinese government. ""Seventy percent of our gowns, our gloves, our masks, personal protective equipment, 20 of our medications, antibiotics are made by an enemy, but we can't make it here,"" Sethi stressed. ""We have to change that. The Washington insiders, the establishment Republicans, they sold our supply chains down the road. We have to bring that back here."" Sethi also attacked Obamacare by stressing it has made health care more expensive. ""We pay health care providers to treat disease and not promote wellness,"" he said. ""If you have diabetes, you have become our best friend. If you have pre-diabetes, nobody cares."" On illegal immigration, Sethi said he supports building a southern border wall and ending chain migration and birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants. ""It is not racist to talk about illegal immigration,"" Sethi said. ""We need to pause all immigration right now until we can figure out what's happening in our American economy."" There are 15 candidates on the August GOP Primary ballot, but a number of Republicans view this race as between Sethi and former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander. Still, Sethi called Trump ""the greatest president of our lifetime."" Sethi has loaned $1.9 million to his campaign on the way to raising a total of about $3.7 million, according to a first quarter disclosure filed with the Federal Election Commission. He had about $2 million cash on hand at the end of the first quarter. Hagerty, in contrast, has raised more than $7.1 million including a $2.5 million loan that didn't come from him. At the end of the first quarter, he had $5.6 million cash on hand. Sethi also addressed these questions: What's your take on the nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd? ""Peaceful protest is constitutional. Burning and looting is unacceptable. I applaud the president for what he did with Antifa in making it a terrorist organization. Take Nashville for example. The vast majority of the people arrested doing this stuff were not even from this state. My heart goes out to the Floyd family and the investigation. Ninety nine point nine percent of police officers are good people. I have taken care of police officers who took a bullet for somebody in the line of duty. We can't forget that right now.""

My feeling is the consumer is the customer, and if the customer is not happy, we've got to think about ways to improve it. I know there have been some issues.""",0.0

1623564294,2020-06-02 15:13:43,GOP senator: Trump used 'Word of God as a political prop',http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129815,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — A Republican senator spoke out Tuesday against President Donald Trump's use of the Bible ""as a political prop"" as the president warned protesters he would deploy the U.S. military to end violent protests against police brutality. Police used tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park Monday night near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. ""There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property, and no right to throw rocks at police. But there is a fundamental — a Constitutional — right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,'' Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse said Tuesday. Sasse, who has at times criticized Trump but won his endorsement for reelection, said public officials nationwide ""should be lowering the temperature"" over protests and violence following the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and one has been charged with murder in Floyd's death. ""Police injustice — like the evil murder of George Floyd — is repugnant and merits peaceful protest aimed at change,'' Sasse said, adding that ""riots are abhorrent acts of violence that hurt the innocent.'' Both messages should be heard as Americans work to end violence and injustice, Sasse said. Sasse's comments were among the strongest by GOP senators following Trump's demand Monday to end the heated protests and his vow to use military force to achieve that if necessary. Republicans have frequently muted any criticism of Trump, and only GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah voted in favor of Trump's impeachment in February. After Trump's hardline speech Monday in the White House Rose Garden, the president walked to nearby St. John's Church, where he held up a Bible for photographers. Trump's actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said his impression was that Trump ""thought this would be some unifying message, but of course it was for half the country, and the other half were outraged by it. And that's just where we are sadly."" On Trump's threat to send in the military to quell violence, Cornyn said he believes Trump would only do so as a last resort. ""I think he would arguably have the authority to do, although there would be a lot of constitutional scholars debating what the contours of that authority are,'' Cornyn said. ""But so far he hasn't done it. Hopefully, he won't do it. It won't be necessary. And we will try to bring some peace back to our communities."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., condemned rioting in his home city of Louisville and other cities, even as he said the nation is united in horror and opposition to Floyd's murder. ""This selfish violence takes us farther away from any national healing or forward progress. It does not bring positive change any closer. It pushes it farther away,'' McConnell said Tuesday on the Senate floor. ""The legitimate and important voices of peaceful protesters will never be heard over the wailing of fire alarms, the smashing of plate-glass windows, and the sirens of ambulances coming for police officers who have been assaulted or shot in the head,'' McConnell said. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, meanwhile, said use of National Guard troops ""should be a local decision,"" based on ""what the mayors and governors want."" Portman said he does not expect U.S. troops to move into Ohio or other states. ""The National Guard certainly in Ohio is capable of handling the situation,"" he said.",0.0

By the time the workers paused Tuesday morning, little was left of a spire that had become a lightning rod for controversy in recent years and a focal point for local protesters outraged by George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis. On Sunday, the obelisk — known formally as the Confederate Sailors and Soldiers Monument — was the site of a speech from Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, who pleaded with the crowd. Some protesters had already vandalized the monument and toppled another statue in the park, that one of former Confederate officer Charles Linn. Woodfin asked that demonstrators refrain from trying to tear down the much larger monument — so that his government could do it instead. ""Allow me to finish the job for you,"" the mayor told a crowd behind his mask and a megaphone. And he persuaded them to give him until midday Tuesday to pull the monument down. ""I wanted you to hear it directly from me. But I need you to stand down."" On Monday, Woodfin declared a state of emergency and implemented a curfew for the city, citing the previous night's protests during which police arrested at least two dozen people. Birmingham isn't the only city reckoning with its Confederate past in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Since the release of a video showing the black man's arrest in Minneapolis, during which a white officer plants a knee on Floyd's neck, protesters in several cities and towns below the Mason-Dixon Line have directed their frustration — and sometimes vandalism — toward local Confederate monuments. In Alexandria, Va., a statue commemorating Confederate soldiers came down Tuesday morning. It was removed a month earlier than scheduled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy due to fears of vandalism, according to The Washington Post. Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving. pic.twitter.com/CZTjlOkpfT — Justin Wilson (@justindotnet) June 2, 2020 This week's move likely isn't the final chapter in the Birmingham monument's story, which was knotty well before the latest spasm of unrest trained attention back on it. Woodfin's predecessor, William Bell, ordered the memorial partly hidden with plywood screens in 2017 following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued the city, citing a violation of a state law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, which protects against the relocation or alteration of Confederate symbols that have been up for more than four decades. A unanimous state Supreme Court decision last fall sided with the monument's supporters, bringing the plywood down and assessing a fine of $25,000 against the city of Birmingham. Now Marshall has threatened another lawsuit over the city's move.

On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee begins the first of a planned series of hearings on the origins of the FBI's 2016 Russia investigation into possible ties with the Trump campaign. Republicans are particularly interested in the decision-making inside the Obama-Biden administration. Further, the Senate Homeland Security Committee late last month approved a subpoena along party lines for Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. ""The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the U.S. who is currently trying to be president got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $80,000 a month,"" said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, accused the committee's chairman, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., of abusing his power to aid Trump. ""We're in the middle of the worst public health and economic crisis in a century,"" he said, ""and what is Senator Johnson focused on? Running a political errand for Donald Trump by wasting Homeland Security Committee time and resources attempting to resurrect a craven, previously-debunked smear against Vice President Biden."" It is the allegation at the heart of Trump's impeachment — the president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and conspiracy theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and in December 2019, Trump was impeached for abuse of power by the House of Representatives for making the ask. The Senate acquitted the president in February after a contentious trial. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans using the Senate to try to help get Trump reelected. ""There are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee's attention but instead this committee is doing the president's personal bidding,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a potential contender to be Biden's running mate. During the first Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, senators will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., plans to subpoena 53 individuals, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former director of national intelligence James Clapper — all frequent Trump political targets. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had generally avoided weighing in on these investigations, but he fully embraced them in a recent Senate floor speech. ""No matter what some Washington Democrats may try to claim, you are not crazy or a conspiracy theorist if you see a pattern of institutional unfairness towards this president. You would have to be blind not to see one,"" he said. Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley, who testified against Trump's impeachment in the House, said investigations can be political and still have merit. ""I certainly believe that the oversight interests are stronger when you're looking at things like the Russia investigation. The Burisma controversy presents a more challenging question, however, I tend to favor some inquiry."" As vulnerable House Democrats experienced during impeachment, high-profile partisan inquiries can spark political backlash when voters have more urgent concerns — like the pandemic, the economy and social unrest. Graham was quick to announce last Friday that the Senate Judiciary Committee would also hold a hearing on police use of force. Democratic strategist Scott Mulhauser is a former Biden aide, and a former Senate aide. He said Senate Republicans — who are fighting to hold their majority this November — could be making a political blunder. ""It's an overreach here, an overplay of your hand with these hearings. Taking your eye off the ball is a mistake that could cost careers."" Graham says he would like to issue a committee report by October, ahead of Election Day.  Copyright 2020 NPR.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Senate Republicans are launching investigations involving the Obama administration and President Obama's vice president, the presumptive Democratic nominee this time, Joe Biden. Today the Senate Judiciary Committee is beginning hearings on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. Republicans are also investigating what they claim is questionable dealings by the Biden family, although there's no evidence to support those CLAIMS. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis has this preview. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Senate Republicans haven't always shared President Trump's interest in investigating Joe Biden. Those days are over. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK SCOTT: The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the United States, who is currently trying to be president, got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $30,000 - or $80,000 a month. DAVIS: Florida Senator Rick Scott joined every Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month to vote for a subpoena of Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. A spokesman for the Biden campaign has accused Republicans of, quote, ""running a political errand"" for the president. This allegation is at the heart of Trump's impeachment. The president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and unfounded theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and Trump was impeached for abuse of power for making the ask. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans now using the Senate to try to boost Trump's reelection chances. Here's California Senator Kamala Harris. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: There are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee's attention. But instead, this committee is doing the president's personal bidding. DAVIS: Today, in the Judiciary Committee, Republicans hold their first oversight hearing into the decision-making process inside the Obama-Biden administration around the FBI investigation of Trump associates during the 2016 campaign. They will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham plans to issue subpoenas for 53 individuals, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, all frequent Trump targets. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had largely avoided weighing in on this, but he recently embraced the investigations in a floor speech.

In Nashville on Saturday, a peaceful afternoon march was overshadowed by destruction later in the evening, when some in the crowd broke windows and set fires in city hall. Police wearing masks and carrying shields deployed tear gas and arrested dozens. Gov. Bill Lee authorized curfews in several Tennessee cities this week to curb the unrest. Early in the week, there were signs of common ground and enduring anger across the state. In Nashville on Monday, hundreds gathered for a vigil at the Capitol as state lawmakers returned to session.

(WJHL)- Johnson City Police Chief Karl Turner addressed a protest in Johnson City Monday that lasted into the overnight hours and lead to several arrests. Chief Turner was first up to the podium ahead of another night of a scheduled protest and a Black Lives Matter Caravan, both scheduled to take place in downtown Johnson City. “We’re reaching out to them right now trying to point out ways that they can protest peacefully and we’ll also have our officers here again in case there are problems we need to address,” Chief Turner said. He also addressed the fact that several of the people arrested Monday night were from outside of the Tri-Cities region. “From looking at the arrest report and the people that were arrested, seven of those I believe were not from Johnson City…Knoxville, I think Spring Hill was another city if I remember correctly,” Chief Turner said. PREVIOUS STORY: Protests last into the night in Johnson City; 11 arrested Johnson City Mayor Jenny Brock said protesters are planning to gather at 6 p.m. at City Hall Tuesday and walk to Founders Park. Brock said she was planning to walk with protesters Monday night, but that things took a turn. “I would say we need to kind of convert this outrage into output, what can we do about it and that’s where we were heading until last night kind of got hijacked by a group that kind of lead the march early and left the Founders Park area,” Mayor Brock said. Brock said she intends to walk with protesters Tuesday night as long as participants follow the law. “We look forward to a peaceful protest tonight and we will continue to listen,” Mayor Brock said. It was asked during Tuesday’s briefing if there has been a consideration for a curfew amid the protests in Johnson City. Johnson City’s City Manager Pete Peterson said in part, “At this time there is not justification to impose a curfew. In order to have the justification for a curfew, there need to be acts of violence, something that really warrants ratcheting up control of the situation to a different level,” Peterson said.

It ended with the protesters leaving peacefully after Guard members laid down their shields. On the plaza, a series of speakers addressed the diverse crowd, who wore masks and held signs. In between the remarks, the crowd sang songs and chanted ""black lives matter"" and ""no justice, no peace."" Organizers regularly addressed the media, emphasizing that this was a peaceful rally and urging reporters to ""go back and tell the truth."" ""We understand the power of the media,"" Russell Pointer, one of the lead organizers of the event, told the Scene later. ""Without somebody being here on the ground, without somebody telling the truth, it's easy to misconstrue peaceful protest with riotous looting and burning which we saw. We don't condone any type of violence, we're not with any violence. We're here peacefully exercising our constitutional rights."" At one point, a woman named Dominique warned the crowd against attempts by police to shift the narrative or deflect attention from systemic problems and violence against black Americans. ""The police are not with us,"" she said. ""It doesn't matter how many times they come and kneel next to us."" Her words resonated in a town that has seen how such stunts don't always portend real change. Metro Police Chief Steve Anderson was lauded in national headlines in 2014 when he directed his officers to greet people protesting police brutality with hot chocolate instead of tear gas. What followed was years of resistance to reform like body cameras and civilian oversight of the police department. Later, the protesters took knees and asked the National Guard to join them, though none did. After Dominique, a white man took the megaphone to address white people, calling out their silence about racism and claiming responsibility for ending it. ""This is not black people's job to make white people understand that black lives matter,"" he said. There was no organized counter protest, although as a later speaker led the crowd in song one white man with a Confederate flag mask and a sign that read ""All Lives Matter"" knelt in front of him. When prominent Nashville activist Justin Jones spotted some lawmakers watching the rally from a balcony at the Capitol, he turned to address them, inviting them to come speak to the crowd as the people started chanting ""join us!"" Next, Jones asked the crowd to form a two-by-two line and follow him across the street to the Capitol. As they began to walk, he called to the National Guard members through the megaphone: ""We are unarmed, nonviolent protesters."" The crowd gathered on the Capitol steps right in front of the line of National Guard members, who wore riot gear and stood with large shields in front of them. The crowd returned to singing and chanting, periodically inviting the armed Guard members and state troopers to join in. At one point, Jones led the crowd in a chant: ""Why are you in riot gear? I don't see no riot here!"" Later, he asked the National Guard members, who were lined up less than a foot from where he stood, to lay down their shields. They did. The crowd cheered and began singing the spiritual ""Down by the Riverside"": ""I'm gonna lay down my sword and shield, down by the riverside."" See more photos of the event below.

I was 5 years old the first time I heard the n-word. I had no idea what it meant, but I remember that everyone “ooh’ed” and “um’ed” as I sat confused. Even with the reactions, I did not know that it was something that should offend me. This was just the beginning of the memories. Another memory was in fourth grade when a friend was having a slumber party and advised that she could not invite me because I was black. Unlike my first experiences of racism, fourth-grade me knew this was messed up and that only certain people were affected. Since born and raised in the South, our parents educated us on racism and discrimination. Since both my sister and I went to college and on to have decent careers, the adversity seemed to have the opposite of the intended impact. Please don’t worry if this doesn’t resonate. It only affects certain people. I was 18 years old the first time I heard the n-word as an adult. Yes, in 2001 I was openly referred to as this and “colored” during a casual conversation. It was at my orientation. I will never forget that rage. It was frustrating because I thought adulthood would be different, but I was still affected. Slavery did not end racism I am 37 years old and I still experience similar situations on a regular basis. They are now just more subtle and/or passive aggressive. Are you surprised? Are you clutching your pearls or shaking your head in disbelief? Like I said, it only affects certain people.

At least 200 protesters kneeled, sang, cheered and marched together through downtown Knoxville on Monday afternoon, blocking traffic but dispersing peacefully. Murfreesboro protesters gathered Monday to speak out against arrests made during a weekend demonstration. Protesters shouted at officers, expressing anger and frustration. Deputies began conversations with many demonstrators, although some of the protesters remained skeptical. Chattanooga saw a tense but largely peaceful demonstration Monday evening. According to a report from the Chattanooga Times Free Press, a line of demonstrators insulted and mocked officers before the crowd dispersed overnight. Reporters from The Tennessean, The Daily News Journal, The Commercial Appeal and the Knoxville News Sentinel contributed.

1623612320,2020-06-02 15:47:23,"Calls grow for Nashville to end curfews, remove Police Chief Steve Anderson",http://rssfeeds.tennessean.com/~/625900760/0/nashville/home~Calls-grow-for-Nashville-to-end-curfews-remove-Police-Chief-Steve-Anderson/,en,False,,73100,blogs.tennessean.com,http://blogs.tennessean.com/#spider,"There are growing calls to end curfews in Nashville and replace the city's police chief, as advocates ask city leaders to take action to address allegations of racial bias in the police department. Hastily announced curfews have swept cities across the country as thousands have protested police brutality and systemic racism. In Nashville, peaceful demonstrations Saturday took a turn in the evening, leading to disruption and damage to the city's historic Metro Courthouse and other businesses downtown. Mayor John Cooper, in collaboration with Gov. Bill Lee, declared a state of emergency in the city and brought in the Tennessee National Guard. Curfews, which the mayor said he will consider on a day-to-day-basis, were implemented Sunday and Monday. On Tuesday afternoon, Cooper announced there would be no curfew for that night. But as President Donald Trump threatened Monday to deploy U.S. military to cities, At-large Council member Bob Mendes said Nashville should go the other way and trust people to exercise their rights peacefully. Mendes said he agreed measures were needed to clear downtown Saturday as individuals set fire to the courthouse. But now, he said, officials haven't been able to articulate what risks remain. ""I cannot support the idea of infringing on civil liberties for hypothetical harm,"" Mendes told The Tennessean Tuesday. Other community groups, including the ACLU, have criticized curfews for lacking scope and duration and leading to the very abuses that are being protested. ""These measures give police too much discretion over whom to arrest and will lead to selective and biased enforcement and risk harassment of people who are unhoused,"" the ACLU said in a statement. Cooper said further action was needed as he watched Saturday's events, which began with a peaceful rally at Legislative Plaza and then turned tense during a standoff between police and some protesters outside the downtown police precinct. He and Police Chief Steve Anderson have taken criticism from both sides of the issue, including from those who say officials were too slow to address vandalism and make arrests. Both have publicly advocated the need to facilitate peaceful protest and for officers to exercise restraint in those situations. EMERGENCY ALERT: Why your phone was 21 minutes late with a Nashville curfew notification Monday night Pressure mounts to remove police chief Chants broke out Saturday to defund police and for Anderson to resign. Mendes Tuesday renewed his call for Anderson to be removed Tuesday. ""He has not over the years shown an understanding for the position of the African American community, and other minority communities in town,"" Mendes said. ""The decision of multiple mayors is that it would be too disruptive to get rid of Chief Anderson. Another year and another mayor and it's still deemed to be disruptive."" The city, Mendes said, has squandered the opportunity in the past but can now work to build credibility on policing issues. Cooper said the city needs to not be diverted from the challenge of providing equal fair justice by protests that cause damage and vandalism. He said he will be meeting with leaders this week to determine what can be done better in Nashville, said it's time for elected officials to ""listen carefully"" to the community. “There is never the right time. We just have to do it and stop waiting.” Delishia Porterfield, Metropolitan Council member Metro Council's Minority Caucus has told Cooper that listening to the concerns of the black community is not enough and that action is necessary. Council members are calling for, among other items, support of the oversight board to do its job and for Cooper to fund body cameras and hire a diversity chief officer. ""(These) are priorities on issues that need to be addressed,"" said Council member Delishia Porterfield. ""They have not happen but we need to move forward and get past comments like 'Now is not the time.'"" ""There is never the right time. We just have to do it and stop waiting,"" she said. Cooper acknowledged that his administration hasn't been able to to be a platform for much change as a result of the ongoing pandemic and the March tornado, he said, has meant his office hasn't been a platform for much change, instead, one of ""healing and delivering services."" Though equipping all police officers with body-cameras is once again on the back-burner, Cooper pledged to move forward with a full program once the city gets beyond its ""crisis budget."" Even then, some argue without widespread changes and training for public safety on the front-end, body-cameras can only go so far. ""Though they can give more transparency with police interactions, it doesn’t prevent those interactions from happening,"" said Jamel Campbell-Gooch, deputy director of Gideon's Army and a member of the Community Oversight Board. Campbell-Gooch said funding for public safety needs to be reallocated, away from traditional policing and instead funding neighborhood mediation programs administered by community members. An 'opportunity to do things differently' Many city officials, including Anderson have condemned police actions that led to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, when an officer held his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. Activists and community advocates say those words stand in stark contrast to their response to police shootings at home. They say the department has been a barrier against local police reforms In his response Monday about the community relationship, Anderson acknowledged strain between his department and the community. He said it was rooted in past actions. ""I try not to dwell there, but certainly we want to take advantage of every opportunity we can to work together to ... tear down the fences between any community, to make sure that we have other relationships that we want,"" he said. The calls for Anderson’s ouster have been a culmination of many years of public tension between the MNPD’s top brass and Nashville’s black community. They were amplified after Gideon's Army released its Driving While Black report in 2016, and in 2017 when white police officer Josh Lippert shot and killed Jocques Clemmons, a black man, after a traffic stop and foot chase. Then again in 2018 when white police officer Andrew Delke shot Daniel Hambrick, 25, while he was running away during a foot pursuit. SAnderson has been a point of frustrations that multiple mayors have shied away, said Campbell-Gooch ""Who can reign in Chief Anderson? It's supposed to be the mayor,"" he said. The mayor has the authority to remove the police chief. MNPD Chief Steve Anderson said ""gross negligence"" contributed to the escape of four juveniles from the Juvenile Detention Center. (Photo: Mike Fant) On the campaign trail, Cooper declined to comment on Anderson's future. Asked earlier this week if he supported Anderson, Cooper said what played out Saturday on live television showed the actions of the police department working well in a very difficult moment. ""He is the chief. And I think deservingly should take some credit,"" Cooper said. Even before recent events, the administration was ""very aware"" of the need to build stronger partnerships between police and the minority community, Cooper spokesperson Chris Song said. ""It’s one of the reasons we worked so hard to establish a memorandum of understanding between the Community Oversight Board and the Metro Nashville Police Department,"" Song said. But there's criticism that police department, with the support of Anderson, has failed to cooperate with the civilian panel. “For Nashville as a whole, as well as the police department, this is an opportunity to do things differently. To hold themselves (MNPD) to be accountable. They could do that by collaborating with us as a partner,” Community Oversight Board Executive Director Jill Fitcheard said Tuesday. “I think that when it comes to leadership in the city, no one must pick a side,” Fitcheard said. Song said the administration has worked closely to ensure that the board has ""real-time access"" to critical incident alerts, and that Metro Legal and the mayor's office continue to work with the COB on an ongoing basis.

So today, traders squared their positions in preparation, with narrowly mixed results. Soybeans came out on top, with gains of around 0.3%, and winter wheat contracts also landed in the green today. Spring wheat futures took the biggest hit, slumping around 0.9% lower, while corn took on more modest losses in Wednesday’s session. Some drier weather is finally in the forecast, with NOAA’s latest 72-hour cumulative precipitation map expecting very little measurable rainfall in the Midwest or Plains between Thursday and Sunday. Hotter, drier weather should prevail into next week across the central U.S., per the agency’s latest 8-to-14-day outlook. On Wall St, stocks soured after the Federal Reserve reported it expects the U.S. economy to shrink 6.5% this year. The Dow was down 235 points to 27,036 at 2 p.m. CST in a volatile session. Energy futures were mixed. Crude oil and diesel each rose around 0.75%, while gasoline dropped by a similar amount this afternoon. The U.S. Dollar softened moderately. On Tuesday, commodity funds were net sellers of most grain contracts, including corn (-15,500), soymeal (-2,500) and CBOT wheat (-7,000) but were net buyers of soyoil (+1,500). Corn prices held fairly steady Wednesday but slid slightly into the red by the close on some light technical selling. July futures dipped 0.75 cents to $3.2675, while September futures slid half a penny lower to $3.3250 today. Corn basis bids were mostly steady across the central U.S. but did tick 1 to 4 cents higher at a handful of Midwestern locations today. Sales have been generally slow this week as farmers await tomorrow morning’s supply and demand data dump from USDA. Ahead of tomorrow morning’s weekly export report from USDA, analysts expect the agency to show corn sales ranging between 19.7 million and 43.3 million bushels for the week ending June 4, giving it a fair chance to best the prior week’s pedestrian tally of 26.2 million bushels. Also out tomorrow morning is USDA’s monthly WASDE report. Analysts expect the agency to show a rise in 2019/20 corn ending stocks, moving from 2.098 billion bushels in May to 2.150 billion bushels. Analysts also expect USDA to show an increase in 2020/21 ending stocks, at a massive 3.360 billion bushels. Ethanol production continues its comeback in earnest, rising for a sixth consecutive week to a daily average of 837,000 barrels for the week ending Russian consultancy SovEcon raised its estimates for this year’s corn production by 11% due to generally favorable weather conditions in recent weeks, to reach 582.7 million bushels. Russia is renowned for its wheat exports but is also a modest corn exporter. In Brazil, exporter association Anec is estimating the country’s corn exports could top 27 million bushels in June, with exports of 94.5 million bushels likely through the first six months of the year. China has been a consistent buyer of U.S. and Australian grain sorghum this marketing year, but the country has recently turned to Argentina amid trade tensions with its two other major suppliers. Earlier this week, Chinese importers bought 3.1 million bushels of sorghum from Argentina, for arrival as early as July. China only bought 1.3 million bushels of sorghum from Argentina between January and April. Preliminary volume estimates were for 434,325 contracts, trending slightly lower than Tuesday’s final count of 256,785. Soybean prices moved moderately higher on general export optimism, although Brazil’s massive exports to China in recent weeks remains worrisome. July futures picked up 3 cents to $8.6625, while August futures rose 2 cents to $8.68. Soybean basis bids were lightly mixed at two interior river terminals and jumped 5 cents higher at an Indiana elevator Wednesday while holding steady elsewhere across the Midwest today. Ahead of Thursday morning’s weekly export report from USDA, analysts expect the agency to show soybean sales ranging between 25.7 million and 62.5 million bushels for the week ending June 4, offering up a fair chance to best the prior week’s tally of 40.5 million bushels. Analysts also expect USDA to report another 100,000 to 425,000 metric tons of soymeal sales last week, plus 10,000 to 40,000 MT of soyoil sales. In tomorrow’s monthly WASDE report from USDA, analysts expect the agency to show 2019/20 soybean ending stocks to move slightly lower, from 580 million bushels in May to 577 million bushels. In contrast, 2020/21 ending stocks are expected to rise, moving from 405 million bushels last month u to 426 million bushels. Brazilian exporter association Anec says the country’s June soybean exports could reach an estimated 396.8 million bushels. For the first six months of the year, Anec expects Brazil’s soybean exports to top 2.2 billion bushels. Preliminary volume estimates were for 213,527 contracts, tracking moderately below Tuesday’s final count of 258,425. Wheat prices were mixed in an uneven round of technical maneuvering as traders squared positions ahead of Thursday morning’s WASDE report. July Chicago SRW futures added 3 cents to $5.0750, July Kansas City HRW futures inched 0.25 cents higher to $4.58, and July MGEX spring wheat futures fell 4.75 cents to $5.2025. Ahead of Thursday morning’s weekly export report from USDA, analysts expect the agency to show wheat sales ranging between 7.3 million and 29.4 million bushels for the week ending June 4. In tomorrow morning’s monthly WASDE report from USDA, analysts expect fractional gains to the agency’s 2019/20 wheat ending stock estimates, moving from 978 million bushels in May up to 979 million bushels. But 2020/21 ending stocks are expected to drop slightly, from 909 million bushels last month down to 897 million bushels in the June report. According to the latest available customs data, Russia exported 383 million bushels of wheat between January and April – a 22% increase over the same time a year ago. Russia is the world’s No. 1 wheat exporter. And Russia’s SovEcon consultancy is expecting a bigger 2020 wheat crop after some replenishing rains in May erased some drought concerns that had been building in April. SovEcon’s latest forecast is for 3.039 billion bushels (up 1.8% from prior estimates), as harvest kicks off in earnest later this month. Egypt purchased 4.4 million bushels of wheat from Russia in an international tender that closed earlier today. The country’s president recently directed authorities to boost strategic reserves to guard against possible supply disruptions amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The grain is for shipment in July. Importers in the Philippines purchased 2.1 million bushels of animal feed wheat from optional origins in a tender that closed earlier today. The grain is for shipment between mid-August and late October, depending on origin. Tunisia issued an international tender to purchase 4.9 million bushels of soft wheat and 4.6 million bushels of animal feed barley from optional origins, which closes tomorrow. The grain is for shipment between July and September, depending on origin. Thailand passed on all offers in its international tender to purchase 8.8 million bushels of animal feed wheat that closed earlier today but did purchase an as-yet unknown amount of feed barley from Australia for shipment in November. Preliminary volume estimates were for 148,827 CBOT contracts, drifting moderately below Tuesday’s final count of 201,921.",0.0

It's a primary election date that was already going to be a challenge for election officials due to health concerns, even before nationwide unrest led to curfew orders in conflict with polling place hours in some places. In Washington, D.C., as well as the eight states voting Tuesday, the vast majority of ballots are expected to be mailed in. In Montana, for instance, election officials mailed every active registered voter a ballot. But the in-person voting options that are also required to be offered in many places create a unique problem. In Philadelphia, for instance, officials are trying to reassure voters they won't be arrested for voting in the Pennsylvania primary if the city decides to extend a 6 p.m. curfew to Tuesday. Polling places will stay open in the city until 8 p.m. ""Philly residents will not be arrested or prosecuted for going to or coming from voting tomorrow,"" District Attorney Larry Krasner told NPR member station WHYY on Monday. ""No curfew is going to interfere with any voter going to the polls. Please do not let these circumstances dissuade you."" Similarly, the District of Columbia's Board of Elections announced that vote centers, which are scheduled to be open until 8 p.m., would not be affected by a 7 p.m. curfew order in the city. ""Voters at Vote Centers and election workers are permitted to be at Vote Centers at 7, and are allowed a reasonable amount of time to get home,"" the board tweeted Monday evening. Across the country, jurisdictions are also having to adjust their in-person voting options to reduce health risks and accommodate massive poll worker shortages. The District is maintaining 20 polling places as a result of the pandemic, as opposed to its usual 144, and Philadelphia is also offering about a fifth of its normal locations. In Rhode Island, election officials are providing voters with ""one-time use stylus/pen combination devices"" to check in on electronic machines, and vote on paper. The secretary of state's office issued a seven-page report detailing how precincts should be organized and cleaned. Beyond the logistical concerns, the next question is simply whether people will be motivated to vote despite the obstacles, especially now that the Democratic presidential primary is all but wrapped up. ""We really are in uncharted territory for voting in America,"" Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the Voting Rights Project with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said on a call with reporters Tuesday. ""We won't know the impact of the challenges we're facing until much later."" Her organization runs a hotline (866-OUR-VOTE) that voters can call with questions or issues, and she said they received almost 3,000 calls in the past week. On Tuesday, the organization has fielded calls about Indiana voters facing long lines in Indianapolis, Maryland voters who say they did not receive their absentee ballots on time, and Pennsylvania voters confused by precinct changes. Johnson-Blanco called it the ""first super Tuesday of the COVID era,"" and she said that any problems encountered could be clues to issues that should be expected to sprout up again in the general election in November.

We get some good advice.  Guests Melissa Giraud, social justice educator, researcher and advocate. Co-founder of EmbraceRace, an organization that provides resources for parents to teach their children about race. (@RaceEmbrace) Andrew Grant-Thomas, social justice researcher and advocate. Co-founder of EmbraceRace. Former director of programs at the Proteus Fund, a national foundation committed to advancing justice through democracy, human rights, and peace. Deputy director at the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University. (@RaceEmbrace) Christian Cooper, avid bird watcher, comic book writer and biomedical editor for Health Science Communications. New York Audubon Society board member.  Interview Highlights Last week, a video of a white woman calling the police on Christian Cooper, a black birdwatcher in Central Park, went viral. Christian Cooper had asked the white woman, Amy Cooper, to leash her dog. Christian Cooper on how he felt during the confrontation and whether he was scared Christian Cooper: “Any sort of confrontation, of conflict, can be scary. So, yeah, I was scared. I wasn’t overwhelmed by being scared. But, yeah, I was certainly scared. But I think one thing I always try to keep in my head, whenever I’m engaged in any sort of conflict, because there’s always conflict in our society. You don’t want to seek it out, but at the same time, I’m not afraid of it either. You know, there are times when you’re going to have to be in conflict with somebody for various reasons. But the thing I always try to keep in my head is, ‘The person who remains calm wins.’ And that’s what I tried to do in that situation. I just tried to remain calm and just keep doing what I was doing.”  On talking with kids about race For white parents, expose kids to diversity Melissa Giraud: “You start young for one, and you start by exposing your child both, hopefully, in your neighborhood, in your community. … You know, if you’re in a segregated neighborhood, which many of us are, by going out to other communities. To expose them, whether it’s after school or at school, to people who are different from them racially and otherwise. And to make sure that your kids understand that you value difference. And you learn from it. And it’s important to you that they have diverse friends. So maybe you also can model that if it’s possible, again, in your neighborhood, in your part of the country.” On starting the conversation early Melissa Giraud: “It’s multi-factorial. So people often want a recipe and there isn’t a recipe. Like if we knew how to solve structural racism, systemic racism, we would have done it, you know? But we do know that the reason it’s so hard to solve is it’s systemic. And so there are a lot of things to do. So your kid is learning, you know, this cultural soup. They’re learning this stuff from very early. And if we could raise kids in a way that would preempt some of these biases by exposing them to a lot so they’re not afraid. Also teaching them about injustice. And about their own privilege.”  On Point spoke to Ishmail Abdus-Saboor yesterday about how his family is processing the news of this week. As a black parent of two kids, he knew it was time to talk to them about what was happening blocks away from their home in Philadelphia. Here’s part of that conversation: Ishmail Abdus-Saboor: “I look scared as I was telling him these things. And I could equally see the fear on his face as I was sharing with him. And then, you know, out of nowhere, he asks me, ‘Does that mean we’re going back to being slaves?’ I mean, it wasn’t like slavery was on his mind. It’s not like we just had a conversation about slavery. So the fact that his mind went there and he made that connection, it was startling, jarring and it pierced a sword through my heart.” On how black parents can talk to their kids about race Melissa Giraud: “If your child is in a targeted group, this is something we think about a lot. … And it would depend on the conversations that you’ve had before as well. It’s more likely that black families in particular have spoken about racism and have also done sort of the counter-cultural work of cultural empowerment, of talking about freedom fighters like Christian. Of people who have resisted, have taken risks, really. Because they don’t know what the outcome will be, but have been able to stand up and to go on birding. You know, Chris has continued with this thing that he loves to do. … I would also say that showing the Floyd video, like we haven’t shown those to our kids. … You really want to not traumatize or re-traumatize kids who are already aware that they’re in some targeted group.” Andrew Grant-Thomas: “It’s important, I think, for kids to know that there are a lot of people who have done the work to get us, you know, to effect the kind of progress that we’ve made. Clearly, there’s a tremendous more amount of work to do. And we have allies in this work and we ourselves can do that work. Whether it’s about educating ourselves, about giving money to the organizations that are doing the work, it’s about giving our time. It’s about how we raise our children. Advocating, you know, being influencers in our own circles, there are a lot of things that we can do.” On the importance of asking questions Melissa Giraud: “So those are places to start. The last thing I would say there is … to ask questions. … You can start with what they know, or what they think or what’s their response to the video that Chris made of Amy Cooper? And talk it through.” Andrew Grant-Thomas: “I think we often don’t know, we’re not even aware that children are thinking about these things, making sense. That their sensibilities around race are emerging even very, very young, because we don’t create the space for them to show us. So this point about asking questions to me is largely about giving them the space to tell you, to share with you what they’re thinking again, what sense they’re making, what meaning they’re making. And for you to have an opportunity to share sort of your experiences, your ideas, your questions, and to provide some context, which, you know, as a four-year-old or a five-year-old, they probably don’t have.” On teaching white kids to be allies Christian Cooper: “I think the best thing you could do is teach young white kids to be good allies. To stand up for other people in difficult situations, and that might get us to a better place.”  From The Reading List New York Times: “Chris Cooper Is My Brother. Here’s Why I Posted His Video.” — “I grew up in a family of activists and my parents were teachers. They raised me and my brother, Chris, to never shy from fighting injustice. From police brutality, to the war in Iraq, to climate change, we’ve lifted our voices in protest.” EmbraceRace: “‘How do I make sure I’m not raising the next Amy Cooper?’” — “In our social media age, the figure of the ‘entitled White woman’ who calls the police on people of color, especially Black people, simply for living their lives has become so common that she has become a meme.” The Atlantic: “Becoming a Parent in the Age of Black Lives Matter” — “In a park about half a mile from my home is a wide-open field of grass, whose thin, uneven blades rise up past my ankles. The playground near the park is, like other playgrounds across the country, no longer open, surrounded by the orange-plastic fencing that has become unsettlingly familiar.” Houston Chronicle: “How to talk with your kids about police, race, protests” — “This week, the world witnessed video of former Houston resident George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck in Minneapolis. Floyd’s subsequent death sparked protests nationwide. Watching the tragic events unfold on TV or social media can take an emotional toll on most adults, but what about children?” Chalkbeat Colorado: “‘Moments like now are why we teach’: Educators tackle tough conversations about race and violence — this time virtually” — “Reading about Brown v. Board of Education over Google Meet. Holding one-on-one Zooms with students struggling with their emotions. Planning lessons on criminal justice reform for the fall — both in-person and remote, in case school buildings don’t reopen.” USA Today: “George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. What do we tell our children?” — “Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ‘the talk’ once again.” CNN: “How to talk to your children about protests and racism” — “As cities and social media explode with anger over the killing of yet another black man at the hands of police, worried parents struggle with how to protect their children from seeing the worst of the violence while simultaneously explaining the ravages of racism.” This article was originally published on WBUR.org.

In Birmingham, where Rudolph lives, the graffiti-covered, pocked base of a massive Confederate monument was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces overnight. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal in Virginia and a bare flagpole in Florida. Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church, had to see the sight for herself. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the absence of an edifice she long considered a symbol of oppression. “I’m glad it’s been removed because it has been so long, and we know that it’s a hate monument,” said Rudolph, 69. “It didn’t represent the blacks. It just represented the hard times back there a long time ago.” Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis. Now, even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham took down the obelisk a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests. Crews were preparing to finish the job by pulling up the base. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state, which passed a law to protect Confederate icons after rebel monuments were challenged and removed following the killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Alabama authorities said Birmingham would face a $25,000 assessment for violating the state law, but Mayor Randall Woodfin said the fine was more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Online fundraising drives raised more than enough money to pay the fine. Work to remove the monument began Monday, which was Alabama’s holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him. Four people were arrested on criminal mischief charges, and the toppled statue was removed. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city’s only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled “Appomattox,” it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying “Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving.” In Birmingham, Rudolph saw the removal of the rebel monument as unfinished business from decades ago. The more than 50-f00t-tall (15-meter-tall) memorial to Confederate soldiers and sailors was located just a few blocks from the church where Rudolph was badly injured and her sister died when a bomb went off on a Sunday morning. “The things that we were fighting for in the ‘60s aren’t solved yet,” said Rudolph, who testified against Ku Klux Klansmen convicted in the bombing. “We shouldn’t be treated the way they treat us.”",0.0

Act fast! Don’t make the same horrible and deadly mistake you made with the Nursing Homes!!!” In New York on Monday night, people smashed shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breached the doors of Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street despite the first curfew in the city in decades. Police said nearly 700 people were arrested and several officers injured in the overnight violence. New York and other cities braced for more trouble after nightfall Tuesday, with Mayor Bill de Blasio extending an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He said he would do that with the help of community leaders, urging them to step forward: “Create peace. ... Stand up.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them. De Blasio has said he does not want the Guard, and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said he will not send it into the city against the mayor’s wishes. During the violence that gripped communities from coast to coast again on Monday night, police officers were shot, run over and showered with rocks and bottles. In Atlanta, police fired tear gas at demonstrators. In Nashville, more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters. And at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, an SUV plowed into a group of officers, injuring three. An officer was shot and gravely wounded as police tried to disperse a crowd outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. In Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, Mayor Jim Kenney described a chaotic night in which one person was killed attempting to use explosives to open an ATM, a gun shop owner fatally shot a would-be thief, and a 19-year-old died of injuries during looting. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “I fear for my safety every time I get in the car to go for a drive. I fear of getting pulled over. I fear for all 10 of my brothers’ and sisters’ lives, for my parents’ lives!” 19-year-old Amari Burroughs of Parkland, Florida, said Tuesday as she prepared for another protest. “My goal is to use my voice and my leadership to make this world safer so that one day I can bring children here and won’t have to fear for their safety.” Outside the Minnesota Capitol in St. Paul, where a youth protest was held Tuesday, 18-year-old Joseph Tawah agreed. “It’s really hard not to feel afraid,” he said. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. In Richmond, Virginia, several hundred people gathered outside City Hall on Tuesday, shouting down Mayor Levar Stoney, who apologized for police lobbing tear gas at peaceful demonstrators. “Where were you last night when we were being tear-gassed?” a woman yelled. “Where were you? Where were you? Where were you?” the crowd chanted. Meanwhile, Democratic governors and mayors rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, questioning whether the federal government has such authority and warning that such a step would be incendiary. De Blasio said military troops would create “a dangerous scenario,” while Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock likewise warned such a move would just lead to more violence and destruction. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” they said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. Even some in the president’s own party rebuffed the idea, including Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who said his state has what it needs. “The military is here to protect and defend this country. We don’t have that need here in this state,” he said. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump’s threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. The president is not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The unrest in Minneapolis, meanwhile, appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes, even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. Floyd’s family was expected to join a march in Houston on Tuesday. The state of Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. In Atlanta, six officers were charged Tuesday after a video showed authorities dragging two young people from a car during protests. Sending the military into the states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But some state officials asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0
1623632101,2020-06-02 16:07:45,GOP criticism muted on Trump's handling of protests,http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129817,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — Most Republicans continued Tuesday to avoid any criticism of President Donald Trump, though at least two GOP senators spoke out against police use of tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. ""There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property, and no right to throw rocks at police. But there is a fundamental — a Constitutional — right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,'' said Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said he did not think Trump's visit to St. John's Church was helpful. Scott said it was not something he would have done. ""Obviously, if your question is, should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo-op, the answer is no,"" Scott told Politico Tuesday, while noting he did not personally see the incident. Sasse, who has at times criticized Trump but won his endorsement for reelection, said public officials nationwide ""should be lowering the temperature"" over protests and violence following the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and one has been charged with murder in Floyd's death. ""Police injustice — like the evil murder of George Floyd — is repugnant and merits peaceful protest aimed at change,'' Sasse said, adding that ""riots are abhorrent acts of violence that hurt the innocent.'' Both messages should be heard as Americans work to end violence and injustice, Sasse said. The comments by Sasse and Scott were among the strongest by GOP senators following Trump's demand Monday to end the heated protests and his vow to use military force to achieve that if necessary. Republicans have frequently muted any criticism of Trump, and only GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah voted in favor of Trump's impeachment in February. After Trump's hardline speech Monday in the White House Rose Garden, the president walked to nearby St. John's Church, where he held up a Bible for photographers. Trump's actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking GOP senator, said that ""as a general matter, I always think it's a good thing for our elected leaders to be spending time in church.'' Still, Thune said views of Trump's actions were ""going to be in the eye of the beholder. His supporters are going to think ... he was standing up for the things he believes in and they believe in. His detractors are going to say it was a photo op.'' Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump likely ""thought this would be some unifying message, but of course it was for half the country, and the other half were outraged by it. And that's just where we are, sadly."" On Trump's threat to send in the military to quell violence, Cornyn and Thune said they hope Trump does not resort to that. While Trump ""arguably"" has the authority to use military force, ""so far he hasn't done it,'' Cornyn said. ""Hopefully, he won't do it. It won't be necessary. And we will try to bring some peace back to our communities."" Thune said he would ""prefer that these things be handled by the state and local authorities. You want to de-escalate, rather than escalate."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declined to comment on Trump's actions, but said he was relieved there were no deaths and few injuries in the nation's capital Monday night. McConnell condemned rioting in his home city of Louisville and other cities, even as he said the nation is united in horror and opposition to Floyd's death. ""This selfish violence takes us farther away from any national healing or forward progress. It does not bring positive change any closer. It pushes it farther away,'' McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""The legitimate and important voices of peaceful protesters will never be heard over the wailing of fire alarms, the smashing of plate-glass windows, and the sirens of ambulances coming for police officers who have been assaulted or shot in the head,'' McConnell said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he was glad Trump went to a ""historic church in our capital city that was firebombed by terrorists. It was important for the president to be there and say we will not be cowed by terrorists. ... All of us have a First Amendment right to speak, but you don't have a right to burn a church.'' __ Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this story.",0.0
1623635550,2020-06-02 00:00:00,Wise County protest over George Floyd death draws wide range of people,http://www.timesnews.net/Politics/2020/06/02/Wise-County-protest-over-George-Floyd-death-draws-wide-range-of-people.html,en,False,,94121,timesnews.net,http://www.timesnews.net/#spider,"NORTON — A protest Monday over the death of a Minnesota man last week drew a wide range of Wise County and Norton residents and showed solidarity with local law enforcement agencies. The protestors — about 80 to 100 over the space of two hours, lined Wise-Norton Road near the Walmart shopping center and drew plenty of car horns and yells of support from drivers as the group waved signs against the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Wise resident Alexis Greene, one of the organizers, said the idea and plan for the protest came together over the weekend though social media postings. “Honestly, everyone saw the video and it’s one of those things that just causes this outpour of different emotions in all sorts of different communities,” Greene said of video clips shot by bystanders as Minneapolis Police Department Officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes before Floyd was pronounced dead. “We just want to show our support in Wise,” Greene said. “Even though we’re not a big city, we can still show our support and stand with the rest of the nation.” Asked how she felt about statements from the Trump administration and scenes of rioting in other cities in recent days, Greene said it shows change is needed. “We need leadership that’s going to stand up for the obvious rights that have been deprived from a large group of the community,” Greene said. “We need someone who’s going to stand up for that, and I guess it’s just up to the people to decide who that is.” Wise resident Steve King, who came to the protest with his daughter to see to her safety, gave younger protesters a pep talk before they marched to the roadside. “Do your thing. Change the world. I’ve got confidence in you,” King said. “I believe in social and racial justice and it’s time,” King said before following the group. “It’s time to change this world, it really is, and we can do it through peaceful protest. These kids here are going to change this world and I firmly believe it. Our generation failed them. We failed them big time and we owe it to them to support them and do what we can to help bring about that change.” King said that, despite the four Minneapolis officers seen with Floyd before his death, he supports police. “These guys in blue, I support them 100 percent. They’re the good guys. We have some bad apples that betrayed their profession that gave them a bad name, but they’re stepping up. That’s what we need.” As the protesters lined up on the sidewalk, they began chants of “Peace on the left, justice on the right” and waved signs including references to Floyd’s words to Chauvin before he died: “I can’t breathe.” Norton resident Kimi Berry and her 10-year-old daughter Melanie found themselves at the protest on short notice. “She said, ‘Mommy, I want to go up there,’ ” Berry said of her daughter, “and I said put your shoes on, and here we are. I didn’t even know. She was on her tablet and she said, ‘They’re having a protest at Walmart and I’d like to go.’ ” Berry said that what happened to Floyd struck a nerve with her. “It’s difficult for me,” Berry said.” I have a 16-year-old son, so when I see things like this, it hurts like heck, it really does. There’s nothing that could distinguish him from George Floyd, for example. He’s a young black man, he’s a gentle giant and me and my husband have to teach him differently about police and law enforcement because such things like this happen and it’s awful.” “And that’s why (Melanie) wanted to come,” Berry said. “She wanted to come for her brother and her dad.” Wise resident Cindy Bates and granddaughter Ameera Youmessi came to the protest after hearing about it on social media. “I don’t want to get into politics because I don’t feel that’s what it’s about,” Bates said. “I think it’s about drawing attention to the need for equality and standing beside our brothers and sisters, all of us. It’s not about black against white, it’s not black against police. It’s good against evil, it’s people against injustice, and I want to say that I am very proud of our law officers and I stand behind them and I support them but I don’t support injustice.” Bates said the protest also hit home because she has three biracial children and has lived in a community that has welcomed her family without racism. “I don’t stand for the violence and destruction that’s been going on in our country at all, but I stand with them against injustice because if we love each other we have to share our burdens” Bates said. “In my family, there is no racism and we have never had racism. When you recognize things that maybe you’d rather not think about, you have to stand.” Bates said that all sides need to talk and listen to each other to tackle injustice and racism. “We have to hear the pain of the officers who must be heartbroken with the job they do as they’ve been so misunderstood.” Bates said. “I think for the black person that feels their voice is not heard and the justice system that’s let them down. For the families that don’t know how to teach their children about this ugly part of the world. “ Bates said Monday was the first protest she had ever attended. “I feel very awkward, but I feel like I look back on history when I think about this and all the people who’ve protested for my freedoms, that I’m a woman and I can vote, that we are a free country,” Bates said. “I do believe in making our voice heard in a peaceful and respectful ways.” “I think it’s a very good experience for me and a very good learning process,” Youmessi added. Wise County Sheriff Grant Kilgore watched the protest from across the road, and he said he was impressed with how the group handled it. “We always welcome peaceful, lawful protests,” Kilgore said. “We definitely want them to express themselves and their concerns. This is one of the ways they can petition the government and government officials to make change, and we don’t have a problem with it. This is the way that it’s supposed to be done.” Kilgore said he agreed with the protesters’ sentiment about how Floyd’s arrest was handled. “If we find someone who’s mistreating the public and not being a professional and doing their job the way we feel like it needs to be done, that person’s not going to work for my agency,” Kilgore said. “That much I can assure you. We’re not here to abuse anybody or hurt anybody. That’s just not their job.”",0.0

Ralph Northam rejected a request from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to send between 3,000 to 5,000 of the state's national guard to Washington D.C. as part of a massive show of force organized by the Trump administration in response to violent protests, according to Northam's chief of staff, Clark Mercer. Mercer said Trump's comments to governors in a phone call Monday, in which the president said most governors were ""weak"" and needed to ""dominate"" the streets, played a role in the decision. ""The president's remarks to the governors heightened our concerns about how the guard would be used,"" he said. ___ NEW YORK — New York's mayor extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week in hopes of stopping destruction that continued overnight despite the city's efforts to stop protests over George Floyd's death from devolving into lawless mayhem. ""We're going to have a tough few days. We're going to beat it back,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference Tuesday as he announced that an 8 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew would hold through Sunday. The plan came after a night when chaos broke out in midtown Manhattan and the Bronx. On Monday, an 11 p.m. curfew — the city's first in decades — failed to prevent destruction as groups of people smashed their way into shops, including Macy's flagship Manhattan store. Police said nearly 700 people were arrested and several officers were injured during the chaos Monday night and early Tuesday. ___ LAS VEGAS — Separate shootings in Las Vegas during continuing protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have left one man dead and a police officer gravely wounded. Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said Tuesday that the officer was on life support after being shot as police tried to disperse a crowd of protesters outside a Las Vegas strip hotel and casino. Lombardo says the other shooting happened outside a federal building. He says a man was shot by officers several times after he reached for a weapon. The identities of the wounded officer and the fatally shot man have not been made public. ___ STOCKHOLM — More than six thousand people have attended a Sweden-organised online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. The digital ""Sweden in solidarity with Black Lives Matter"" rally Tuesday urged participants to ""check in"" at the Facebook accounts of the U.S. Embassy in Sweden and Nordic neighbors Denmark, Finland and Norway and post photos inspired by the ongoing U.S. events with George Floyd's death. The one hour-long online event with several speakers including poets, activists and politicians was organised by Swedish non-governmental organisations and Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" In his speech, Rashid Musa, head of the Young Muslims of Sweden, called the current situation with African Americans in the United States as ""colonialism 2.0."" ""Malcom X said it best: 'Racism is like a Cadillac, they bring out a new model every year,'"" Musa said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota's attorney general says prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine whether more charges will be filed against officers involved in the death of George Floyd, but they also have to work carefully and methodically. Attorney General Keith Ellison was appointed lead prosecutor in the case Sunday. He told ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday that those who have culpability will be held accountable. Floyd, who was black, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd's neck as Floyd said he couldn't breathe and became motionless. Derek Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But members of Floyd's family and many others are calling for more serious charges, as well as charges against the three other officers who were there. Ellison says despite the widely viewed bystander video of Floyd's final moments, cases against police are hard. He pointed to the deaths of Freddie Gray and Philando Castile, and the beating of Rodney King, as examples of cases where striking video of an incident did not lead to convictions of officers. Ellison did not give a timeline for any new charges. All four officers have been fired. ___ ORLANDO, Fla. — The U.S. Census Bureau says it has temporarily closed offices in several cities as a precaution as cities grapple with unrest following the death of George Floyd. The Bureau would not say Monday which offices have been closed. A spokeswoman says in an email that the closures were done out of an abundance of caution. The Census Bureau is in the middle of the 2020 census, which is attempting to count every resident in the U.S. Census Bureau offices around the country were closed for a month and a half as field operations were suspended in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The offices only began reopening on a rolling basis in the past several weeks. ___ TOPEKA, Kan. — Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly says that bringing the military ""into this contentious moment"" would do more harm than good. Kelly on Monday expressed sympathy for George Floyd's family, families of other people killed by police and people outraged by Floyd's ""tragic murder."" She promised to work to address systemic racism. ""We need our leaders -- myself included -- to listen to those who felt their only means of being heard was to take to the street in protest,"" Kelly said after President Donald Trump threatened to deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests. ""We need action to change the systemic inequalities we have ignored for far too long. We need to stop with the divisive language and instead, come together and do what's right for our state,"" Kelly added. She noted that Kansas protests have been peaceful and promised to work closely with local officials to ensure public safety. ___ WASHINGTON — The streets around the White House complex were shut Tuesday morning, guarded by a mix of Secret Service officers and FBI agents. Overnight, a fence was constructed around Lafayette Park and along 17th St at Pennsylvania Ave, two areas that have been focal points for protests. Work crews were still at work boarding up businesses in the area and attempting to remove graffiti from federal buildings. ___ BUFFALO, N.Y. -- A state trooper who was run over by an SUV that barreled through a group of officers at a George Floyd demonstration in Buffalo broke his leg and shattered his pelvis, police said. Another trooper and a Buffalo police officer were treated for minor injuries after being struck by the Ford Explorer when it broke through a blockade at about 10 p.m. Monday. Troopers were deployed to Buffalo after violence flared downtown this weekend. Officers fired shots at the vehicle before it was apprehended. The driver and a passenger had been shot and were hospitalized with injuries not considered life threatening. A second passenger was uninjured and taken into custody, police said. It was not immediately clear whether the pair in the SUV were wounded by police. Officials in Buffalo initially said they may have been shot at a nearby intersection shortly before the officers were struck. State police say the investigation continues. The unidentified trooper who was run over was treated at a hospital. The other trooper was treated and released for a hand-and-wrist injury. ___ WASHINGTON — A man in the nation's capital said he sheltered about 70 protesters in his home all night after they got caught between police lines after curfew. Rahul Dubey told WJLA-TV he was sitting on his porch around 8:30 p.m. last night when law enforcement officers began corralling protesters on his street. He let some sit with him, and helped others out through his back alley, but the situation then escalated when officers started pushing protesters to the ground and releasing pepper spray, creating a ""human tsunami"" into his home. ""I was hanging on my railing yelling, 'Get in the house! Get in the house!'"" he told The Washington Post. Officers also released pepper-spray through the window after he closed the door, Dubey told WJLA-TV. The protesters inside the home screamed, and started pouring water and milk into their eyes in a scene he described as ""pure mayhem."" One officer came to the door to ask for a piece of the pizza that was delivered to the house overnight as Dubey was on the phone with the TV station, WJLA reported. The protesters left the home after 6 a.m. Tuesday when the district's curfew ended. ___ ST. LOUIS — Police in St. Louis say officers in a marked police car were fired on early Tuesday from a car occupied by suspected looters. The incident led to a chase that ended in the suburb of Jennings, where one of the suspects was shot. Police said the incident was separate from a shooting around midnight Monday in which four St. Louis officers were shot and injured. The Jennings shooting began when officers in a marked police car on the north side of St. Louis who were searching for looting suspects were fired on from men inside a car, police said. That led to a chase that ended in Jennings, just north of St. Louis, when the three suspects bailed out of the car, and one was shot by a St. Louis County officer, police said. One man, identified only as 21 years old, was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries. Police said another man who had been in the car was arrested, and a third escaped. No officers were injured in the Jennings shooting. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Family members of George Floyd are expected to attend a memorial service in his honor Thursday in Minneapolis. The Rev. Al Sharpton is to deliver the eulogy at the service on the campus of North Central University. The civil rights organization Sharpton founded, National Action Network, organized the memorial. The family's attorney, Ben Crump, is also expected to make remarks at the service from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. A Minneapolis police officer was charged last week with third-degree murder in Floyd's death May 25, and three other officers were fired. Bystander video showed the white officer, Derek Chauvin, holding his knee on the neck of the black man while he pleaded for air with his hands handcuffed behind him. ___ WASHINGTON — Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said on CNN on Tuesday it's inappropriate for the military to be used for police work on U.S. streets. ""We don't think that the active duty military should be used on American streets against Americans,"" he said. ""It's an inappropriate use of our military. And we have police in Washington, D.C. We have federal police in Washington, D.C., to focus on the federal properties, and that is an appropriate use. Police have policing power, and bringing in the military to do police work is inappropriate in any state in the United States of America without the consent of the governor, and it would be inappropriate in Washington, D.C."" ___ NEW YORK — An unprecedented curfew in New York City did little to prevent destruction as groups of people smashed their way into shops including Macy's flagship Manhattan store, grabbed merchandise and fled. Police said more than 200 people were arrested and several officers were injured during the chaos Monday night and early Tuesday that followed another day of peaceful protests throughout the city over the death of George Floyd. One officer was struck by a hit-and-run driver in the Bronx and was taken to a hospital in critical condition, police said. Monday was the fourth night in a row of mainly peaceful daytime demonstrations followed by violence and arrests after nightfall. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, both Democrats, announced an 11 p.m. curfew late Monday afternoon. De Blasio said Tuesday's curfew would start earlier — beginning at 8 p.m. and ending at 5 a.m — in an effort to quell late-night violence and destruction. ___ ST. PAUL, Minn. — At least 65 people were arrested at Minnesota's Capitol in St. Paul Monday night for violating a curfew, police said. They gathered peacefully on the Capitol grounds following a march down a St. Paul street. Thousands had gathered earlier in the day at the governor's mansion to demand the arrest and prosecution of all four former police officers involved in the death of George Floyd. In Minneapolis, at the site of Floyd's fatal encounter with police that has become a memorial, the crowd grew slightly agitated awaiting the arrival of police, but there was no widespread property damage. ___ BERLIN — Germany's foreign minister says the peaceful protests in the United States following the death of George Floyd are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" Heiko Maas said in Berlin on Tuesday that his thoughts are with the friends and family of Floyd, who ""lost his life in a truly terrible and shocking way, or one should say it was taken from him."" Maas said that peaceful protests must always be allowed. He added that ""the peaceful protest we are seeing in the United States — with many very moving gestures including by American police officers — this protest is understandable and more than legitimate."" He added: ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States."" Maas also stressed that journalists must be able to do their jobs without risking their safety and criticized violence against them. ___ BRUSSELS — The European Union's top diplomat said Tuesday the death of George Floyd was the result of an abuse of power and that the 27-nation bloc is ""shocked and appalled"" by it. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a white police officer in Minneapolis who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread across America. Borrell says law enforcement officials must not be ""using their capacities in the way that has been used in this very, very unhappy death of George Floyd. This is an abuse of power and this has to be denounced."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" Borrell says ""we trust in the ability of the Americans to come together, to heal as a nation and to address these important issues during these difficult times."" ___ BUDAPEST, Hungary — The Hungarian soccer federation has issued a written reprimand to a player of African origin who showed his undershirt with the words ""Justice for George Floyd"" after scoring for Ferencvaros in its 1-1 draw with Puskas Akademia on Sunday. Tokmac Nguen was born in a refugee camp in Kenya to parents from South Sudan and grew up in Norway. The federation's disciplinary committee said in its ruling issued Monday that any similar actions by Nguen in the future would result in ""actual penalties"" on each occasion. Just hours after Nguen's reprimand, FIFA, the world soccer's governing body urged soccer competition organizers to apply ""common sense"" and consider not sanctioning players demanding justice for Floyd during matches. The German soccer federation is investigating similar actions by four players in the Bundesliga, including American midfielder Weston McKennie, who wore an armband over his Schalke jersey with the handwritten message ""Justice for George."" ___ LAS VEGAS — An officer has been shot in Las Vegas and authorities are responding to another shooting as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said. The officer was shot in the area of the Las Vegas Strip and an officer was involved in a shooting in the downtown area, according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Protesters have been rallying for days across the country over the death of George Floyd, a black man seen on video pleading that he couldn't breathe while a white police officer pressing his knee into his neck for several minutes before he stopped moving. Police in Las Vegas said Monday that 338 people were arrested during three nights of protests. Police said suspects were jailed despite a local court policy calling for most people accused of misdemeanors to receive court summons to prevent the spread of coronavirus. ___ SEOUL — South Korea's Foreign Ministry says it has far confirmed 79 cases of property damage at stores run by Korean Americans amid U.S. protests over the death of George Floyd. The ministry, which held a teleconferencing meeting with diplomats based in the United States to review the demonstrations' impact on Korean Americans and South Korean citizens, said Tuesday it has yet to confirm any injuries or deaths. The ministry says 50 cases of property damage were reported from Philadelphia, 10 from Minneapolis, five form Raleigh and four from Atlanta. ___ SYDNEY — More than 1,000 protesters marched through downtown Sydney on Tuesday in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against the death of George Floyd half a world away. Police escorted a crowd carrying banners that said: ""Black Lives Matter,"" ""Aboriginal Lives Matter,"" ""White Silence is Violence"" and ""We See You, We Hear You, We Stand With You."" The group marched from Hyde Park to New South Wales state Parliament with plans to continue to the U.S. Consulate. The protest proceeded despite some organizers canceling it Monday for fear of conflict with counter protesters. But no counter protest emerged. Around 2,000 demonstrators gathered in Australia's west coast city of Perth on Monday night to peacefully protest Floyd's death, and rallies are planned for other Australian cities this week. Referring to the violence in U.S. streets, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said ""there's no need to import things ... happening in other countries here to Australia."" ___ ST. LOUIS — Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area. The police department tweeted early Tuesday that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots. The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City. On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64. But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. ___ NEW YORK — New York City imposed a late-night curfew Monday that failed to prevent another night of destruction, including arrests after a break-in at the iconic Macy's store on 34th Street, following protests over George Floyd's death. As the 11 p.m. deadline to get off the streets approached, bands of protesters marched peacefully through Manhattan and Brooklyn, but police simultaneously responded to numerous reports of roving groups of people smashing their way into shops and emptying them of merchandise. The doors of Macy's flagship Manhattan store were breached. Police pulled two handcuffed men out and put them in a van. People rushed into a Nike store and carried out armloads of clothing. Near Rockefeller Center, storefront windows were smashed and multiple people arrested. Bank windows were smashed. Wreckage littered the inside of an AT&T store. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop, but instances of vandalism and smash-and-grab thefts mounted as the night deepened. New York joined other cities around the country in imposing a curfew after days of unrest. It comes on top of months of restrictions on public gatherings already imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Enough mayhem happened before the curfew took effect that Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted that it would move up to 8 p.m. Tuesday. The curfew lifts at 5 a.m. ___ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Workers in Alabama's largest city began removing a Confederate monument Monday night after demonstrators failed to knock down the obelisk the night before. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin sent workers with heavy equipment to take down the more than 50-foot-tall Confederate monument made of stone. Late on Monday, after a 7 p.m. curfew took effect and streets were mostly clear, crews began their work. Live video showed workers attaching straps to the peak of the obelisk so it could be lifted away with a crane. Within a few hours they had removed the top of the monument. Woodfin said the city would see if the memorial could be given to a museum or another group. Woodfin said the fine the city may face for violating a state law banning the removal of Confederate and other long-standing monuments is more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Attorney General Steve Marshall, in a statement, said the city would face an assessment of $25,000 if it removed the monument, which has been the subject of a court fight between the mostly black city and Republican-controlled state. ___ CICERO, Ill. — Two people have been killed during unrest in the Chicago suburb of Cicero as protests continued over the death of George Floyd, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania says 60 people were arrested in the town of about 84,000 located west of Chicago. Hanania didn't provide additional information about those killed or the circumstances of their deaths. The Illinois State Police and Cook County Sheriff's Office were called in to help local police Monday as people broke into a liquor store and other businesses and stole items. ___ BUFFALO, N.Y. — A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a George Floyd demonstration Monday night in Buffalo, injuring at least two. Video from the scene shows the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackle a protester on the street and handcuff him. Officers are seen scattering to avoid the SUV as it drives off on Buffalo's east side. Apparent gunshots are heard. The officers were taken to Erie County Medical Center. Authorities said they were in stable condition.",0.0

Sethi, a Nashville trauma surgeon, said his candidacy all starts with his mother and father, who legally immigrated to the U.S. from India. ""When my parents were kids, their homes were burned to the ground by Muslim radicals,"" Sethi told the group at its North Eastman Road headquarters. ""They were left with noting. ... They went to the U.S. Embassy. They stood in line. They waited their turn. They came to this country legally with an 'L.' "" Sethi insisted the COVID-19 pandemic shows why the U.S. is entirely too reliant on the communist Chinese government. ""Seventy percent of our gowns, our gloves, our masks, personal protective equipment, 20 of our medications, antibiotics are made by an enemy, but we can't make it here,"" Sethi stressed. ""We have to change that. The Washington insiders, the establishment Republicans, they sold our supply chains down the road. We have to bring that back here."" Sethi also attacked Obamacare by stressing it has made health care more expensive. ""We pay health care providers to treat disease and not promote wellness,"" he said. ""If you have diabetes, you have become our best friend. If you have pre-diabetes, nobody cares."" On illegal immigration, Sethi said he supports building a southern border wall and ending chain migration and birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants. ""It is not racist to talk about illegal immigration,"" Sethi said. ""We need to pause all immigration right now until we can figure out what's happening in our American economy."" There are 15 candidates on the August GOP Primary ballot, but a number of Republicans view this race as between Sethi and former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander. Still, Sethi called Trump ""the greatest president of our lifetime."" Sethi has loaned $1.9 million to his campaign on the way to raising a total of about $3.7 million, according to a first quarter disclosure filed with the Federal Election Commission. He had about $2 million cash on hand at the end of the first quarter. Hagerty, in contrast, has raised more than $7.1 million including a $2.5 million loan that didn't come from him. At the end of the first quarter, he had $5.6 million cash on hand. Sethi also addressed these questions: What's your take on the nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd? ""Peaceful protest is constitutional. Burning and looting is unacceptable. I applaud the president for what he did with Antifa in making it a terrorist organization. Take Nashville for example. The vast majority of the people arrested doing this stuff were not even from this state. My heart goes out to the Floyd family and the investigation. Ninety nine point nine percent of police officers are good people. I have taken care of police officers who took a bullet for somebody in the line of duty. We can't forget that right now."" What do you think of the Ballad Health merger? ""I have to learn more about it. My feeling is the consumer is the customer, and if the customer is not happy, we've got to think about ways to improve it. I know there have been some issues.""",0.0

JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (WJHL) – Cracked teeth, bruises and a dislocated shoulder. Protesters who took to Johnson City streets Monday night said officers injured them during demonstrations that stretched into the early hours on Tuesday. Almost 12 hours after they were arrested, 11 protesters left the Washington County Detention Center, and many say they plan a return to the streets Tuesday night. Previous story: Protests last into the night in Johnson City; 11 arrested Some bore injuries they say they received while being arrested for protesting police brutality. Protests both peaceful and violent continue spreading across the nation in the wake of George Floyd’s death, a black man who died in the custody of Minneapolis police while being arrested for allegedly passing a counterfeit bill. Jeff Clark, a private citizen and the vice president of the Washington County Young Democrats, bailed nine of the 11 protesters out of jail for a total of $7,300 on Tuesday and said he’ll return to the detention center on Wednesday to bail out any protesters who may be arrested Tuesday. Clark set up a fundraiser to help make bail for the protesters. As of 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, the fundraiser has collected more than $11,000. “I’m concerned that these people were imprisoned for performing their first amendment rights to protest,” Clark said. “This isn’t going to be the last time unless things rapidly change. I understand the anger.” Elizabeth Allen left the detention center with a split chin, scrapes and cracked teeth that she says she got when officers arrested her. Allen said she was watching officers arrest a female protester when her breasts were exposed to the crowd. Allen said she attempted to fix the woman’s shirt, and an officer “tackled” her to the ground. “Two full-sized, 200-plus pound men were on me,” Allen said, adding, “They (the officers) put me down on the ground with such force that my jaw, obviously knocked down on the pavement, split open and blood was pouring from my jaw and into my hair and on the ground.” Protestor, Elizabeth Allen, shows us the injuries she sustained after she says she was thrown to the ground by police last night. Hear her story tonight only on @WJHL11. pic.twitter.com/uaGJDuqZcz — Kelly Grosfield (@KellyGros_WJHL) June 2, 2020 As the protesters filed out of the detention center, Angela Carpenter, who is black, kept an eye out for her son, Dezmond, hours after she watched his arrest on a live stream of the demonstration. Carpenter said she watched in horror as officers “slammed” her son to the ground and he was “held down with a knee on his neck.” She called it the scariest moment of her life. “I’m still hurt (by) this,” she said, adding that she fears for the lives of her son and other black children. “I mean, my son and none of these kids asked for this.” Angela Carpenter said that she watched her son Dezmond get arrested on a livestream.

According to the report from the Johnson City Police Department, Carpenter was also charged with unlawful possession of a weapon after a jail employee found a handgun in his backpack, and Carpenter could not produce a state handgun carry permit. Officials also discovered that Carpenter had outstanding arrest warrants for aggravated burglary and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, which set his bond higher than those of the other arrested demonstrators. Demonstrator Naythan Matherly said officers dislocated his shoulder while arresting him. He also pointed to several scrapes and bruises that he said he received from officers arresting him. He said police began “throwing” protesters “to the ground” when the demonstrators locked arms in a non-violent demonstration in the street. He said after he was arrested, repeated requests for medical assistance were denied. Demonstrator Naythan Matherly said he sustained injuries including a dislocated shoulder when police arrested him early Tuesday morning after hours of protest. Matherly is one of the many protesters who said he plans to return to the streets tonight. He decried the reponse from officers on Monday night, and described officers’ response to the demonstrations last night as “overkill” and that it “pushed protesters over the edge.” “In other cities, they’re burning down buildings and breaking glass and everything and still just pushing them,” he said. “You don’t hit people, you can’t. That’s assault. “ Police Chief Karl Turner said during a press conference Tuesday afternoon that a few Troopers were assaulted as arrests were being made. He acknowledged that one woman suffered a split chin and declined medical attention. Mayor Jenny Brock said officials began taking part in demonstrations that began in Founders Park Monday evening, but that a band of protesters left those demonstrations early and began marching in the streets. She said there was a group that ""hijacked"" that left Founders Park early and led a march down the street — Jessica Fuller WJHL (@fullerjf91) June 2, 2020 Turner, who said he’d planned to march with protesters, said he couldn’t participate because people began blocking traffic in the road. Officials said the concern lies partly in the safety of the demonstrators – City Manager Pete Peterson cited the danger protesters face in the road at night, where motorists may not be able to see them. The Johnson City Police Department provided one report when asked for the arrest reports for all 11 demonstrators. The report does not indicate whether officers used force to arrest demonstrators. According to the report, officers asked protesters to move onto the sidewalk several times when they began blocking four lanes of traffic on West State of Franklin Road with their bodies. Twice, police formed a line and began to advance toward the demonstrators, according to the report, and commanded them to move out of the roadway. When the protesters refused to move, officers took them into custody, the report said. Washington County deputies, Tennessee State Troopers and Greeneville City Police Officers joined JCPD officers after a call for mutual aid. Protesters said they plan to continue demonstrations beginning at 6 p.m. in Founders Park. Brock said she planned to march with demonstrators if they remain on the sidewalk and don’t march in the street.",0.0

Activists took to streets and civic spaces in Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Murfreesboro, Clarksville, Jackson and beyond. They were met with police, the National Guard and state troopers. Confrontations in Tennessee were tense but largely peaceful Monday. The groups in each city were diverse and sometimes disagreed over the right approach, but their mission was a common thread. The demonstrators continued to demand concrete changes to policing in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who died last week in Minneapolis after a white officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. Floyd's death spurred a wave of outrage and condemnation. Protests swept through cities across the country, sometimes marked by police in riot gear firing tear gas and rubber bullets as individuals set fires and damaged buildings. In Nashville on Saturday, a peaceful afternoon march was overshadowed by destruction later in the evening, when some in the crowd broke windows and set fires in city hall. Police wearing masks and carrying shields deployed tear gas and arrested dozens. Gov. Bill Lee authorized curfews in several Tennessee cities this week to curb the unrest. Early in the week, there were signs of common ground and enduring anger across the state. In Nashville on Monday, hundreds gathered for a vigil at the Capitol as state lawmakers returned to session. The crowd sang, prayed and chanted together before moving their group to the steps of the Capitol, singing ""This Little Light of Mine."" They were confronted by lines of National Guard members holding their shields high. Then, after a protester asked them to put their shields down, they did. CLOSE The National Guard at the Capitol drop their shields during the Vigil for Black Lives held at Legislative Plaza Nashville Tennessean Trey Gibson, 20, who attended the Saturday and Monday protests in Nashville, said Monday's gathering was about healing. Although the crowd cheered when members of the National Guard put down their shields, Gibson had a different reaction. ""I feel like it's symbolic,"" he said. ""It looks good, but I'm not buying it. I need to see something concrete."" City leaders in Nashville called for an end to nightly curfews on Tuesday and demanded more robust support for the city's black residents. A pair of protests in Memphis on Monday night appeared to end without confrontation with law enforcement, unlike previous nights. Divisions among some local activists appeared to be on the mend when two groups reconciled early in the evening. A group of marchers urged support for more black-owned businesses while outside the Greater Memphis Chamber offices, criticized Memphis Light, Gas and Water for power cuts and encouraged voting for representative leadership. At least 200 protesters kneeled, sang, cheered and marched together through downtown Knoxville on Monday afternoon, blocking traffic but dispersing peacefully. Murfreesboro protesters gathered Monday to speak out against arrests made during a weekend demonstration. Protesters shouted at officers, expressing anger and frustration. Deputies began conversations with many demonstrators, although some of the protesters remained skeptical. Chattanooga saw a tense but largely peaceful demonstration Monday evening. According to a report from the Chattanooga Times Free Press, a line of demonstrators insulted and mocked officers before the crowd dispersed overnight.

That damage to Winfield's Fine Shoes was one of the few examples of damage to private property over six nights of protest against police brutality in Memphis. Instead, for hours every evening, Memphians marched peacefully through the streets, chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” “Say his name, George Floyd” and “Whose streets? Our streets.” Although passionate and, at times confrontational, the tenor of Memphis protests have been peaceful — without looting or violence that has struck some cities in recent days. Sunday night, the group splintered, and a smaller line of protesters walked out on Interstate 55, hopping the median to change directions and, at one point, diverting through a neighborhood in an endeavor to avoid law enforcement.

Sometimes it was unclear whether the people causing damage had been with the march earlier. ""In the past 48 hours, we've had 10 businesses vandalized, three police cars vandalized, three incidents of officers being shot at. This is unacceptable and it will not be tolerated,"" Memphis Police Director Mike Rallings said at a press conference Monday afternoon. No officers were shot. It's unclear if any of the shootings were related to the protests. Several times, when people began throwing bottles or rocks or knocked over planters, leaders in the protest would begin to scream back.

But Memphis' protests also featured divisions in local leadership, with more seasoned activists opposing Hill's control. When the group splintered Sunday night and Hill left after failing to silence dissenters, a smaller group made a long march out onto I-55. Organizer Rob Brown said he hoped the march would continue until Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and County Mayor Lee Harris met with the group to give them what they want.

Twice, the group was rebuffed by tear gas and pepper spray, once after some protesters got into a shoving match with and threw rocks at officers. That night and early into the next morning, 31 people were arrested, nearly all facing one or more misdemeanor charges. The most common charges were obstruction of a highway or passageway and resisting arrest. But the police tactics used Sunday night were noticeably milder than ones used in an incident that began Saturday. Saturday night, after the march dispersed, Memphis Police Department officers dressed in riot gear were captured on video tackling a woman on video on Beale Street. The video was captured by a Commercial Appeal reporter. In it, MPD officers can be heard yelling, ""Somebody get the girl in the gray hoodie,"" before several officers grab her and pull her down to the street.

Memphis Commercial Appeal The woman, Victoria Jones, was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct, rioting and resisting official detention. She is the founder of a Memphis arts nonprofit The Collective. Strickland, the Memphis mayor, has since called for an investigation. He has also requested an investigation after a Memphis police officer was captured on camera knocking down a woman protesting on Union Avenue last week. The day after the failed attempt to take the bridge, activists tried a new tactic: a “rolling bridge blockade,” driving slowly over the Interstate-40 and Interstate-55 bridges, sometimes between 10-30 miles an hour, blinkers on, stalling traffic. Some people raised fists out of their windows.

(Photo: Joe Rondone) State troopers had a heavy presence on the bridge, and officers had multiple ramps blocked on both the Tennessee and Arkansas sides of the river, also impeding traffic. At the same time as the “rolling bridge blockade,” the marches downtown continued. As protesters marched east down Poplar Avenue, they encountered members of the Memphis Police Department and Tennessee State Highway Patrol. One highway patrolman carried a nightstick. Protesters approached him and asked him to put it away, saying that they came in peace and its presence intimidated them. The patrolman nodded, but continued to hold the baton. Then, Memphis Police Officer Louis Brownlee, who works in public affairs for the department, whispered something in the patrolman’s ear. The patrolman put down the baton and the crowd cheered. Stopping in the intersection of B.B. King and Beale Street, the group took a moment to sit in the street and pray before heading back to the ""I Am a Man Plaza"" to disperse before the newly instated 10 p.m. curfew. “We’re out here right now … thanking you for Memphis right now, thanking you for the state of Tennessee right now, all these marches that are going on all over this country, black and white have come together like never before,” prayed the Rev. Charles Johnson, a Memphis pastor. “We thank you, God, for bringing us together.” Reporters Samuel Hardiman and Desiree Stennett contributed to this report.

In Nashville on Saturday, a peaceful afternoon march was overshadowed by destruction later in the evening, when some in the crowd broke windows and set fires in city hall. Police wearing masks and carrying shields deployed tear gas and arrested dozens. Gov. Bill Lee authorized curfews in several Tennessee cities this week to curb the unrest. Early in the week, there were signs of common ground and enduring anger across the state. In Nashville on Monday, hundreds gathered for a vigil at the Capitol as state lawmakers returned to session. The crowd sang, prayed and chanted together before moving their group to the steps of the Capitol, singing ""This Little Light of Mine."" They were confronted by lines of National Guard members holding their shields high. Then, after a protester asked them to put their shields down, they did. CLOSE The National Guard at the Capitol drop their shields during the Vigil for Black Lives held at Legislative Plaza Nashville Tennessean Trey Gibson, 20, who attended the Saturday and Monday protests in Nashville, said Monday's gathering was about healing. Although the crowd cheered when members of the National Guard put down their shields, Gibson had a different reaction. ""I feel like it's symbolic,"" he said. ""It looks good, but I'm not buying it. I need to see something concrete."" City leaders in Nashville called for an end to nightly curfews on Tuesday and demanded more robust support for the city's black residents. A pair of protests in Memphis on Monday night appeared to end without confrontation with law enforcement, unlike previous nights. Divisions among some local activists appeared to be on the mend when two groups reconciled early in the evening. A group of marchers urged support for more black-owned businesses while outside the Greater Memphis Chamber offices, criticized Memphis Light, Gas and Water for power cuts and encouraged voting for representative leadership. At least 200 protesters kneeled, sang, cheered and marched together through downtown Knoxville on Monday afternoon, blocking traffic but dispersing peacefully. Murfreesboro protesters gathered Monday to speak out against arrests made during a weekend demonstration. Protesters shouted at officers, expressing anger and frustration. Deputies began conversations with many demonstrators, although some of the protesters remained skeptical. Chattanooga saw a tense but largely peaceful demonstration Monday evening. According to a report from the Chattanooga Times Free Press, a line of demonstrators insulted and mocked officers before the crowd dispersed overnight.

They differ, however, in what caused the African-American man’s death. While an independent autopsy commissioned by Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner in Minneapolis, the largest city in the US state of Minnesota, ruled that the victim experienced “cardiopulmonary arrest” while being restrained by a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, during his arrest on May 25. The findings of those post-mortem examinations, both of which were released on Monday, have caused the net to tighten on the four former police officers involved. All four have been fired. But only Chauvin, who faces third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges for kneeling on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds while the suspect was handcuffed on the ground and repeatedly said he was unable to breathe, thus far has been taken into custody. “The cause of death in my opinion is asphyxia, due to compression to the neck – which can interfere with oxygen going to the brain – and compression to the back, which interferes with breathing,” said Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner who was one of the physicians in charge of the independent autopsy. He also said that no previous pathology played a role in the death of the 46-year-old Floyd, who had been detained after being suspected of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a supermarket in a Minneapolis grocery store. Following the results of the independent autopsy, the attorney representing Floyd’s family, Ben Crump, called for the charges against Chauvin to be upgraded to first-degree murder and said the other officers should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. He accused the officers of killing Floyd “based on a knee to his neck for almost nine minutes, and two knees to his back compressing his lungs,” adding that the ambulance into which he was subsequently placed “was his hearse.” The Hennepin County autopsy, meanwhile, said that “the victim suffered cardio-respiratory arrest while being immobilized by law enforcement officials.” It said that at the time of his death Floyd was suffering from heart problems and also was under the effects of fentanyl intoxication, although it did not link those factors to his death. The autopsy results are now in the hands of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison after he took the reins of the case from Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, who had announced the charges against Chauvin on Friday. Ellison, who in the past has criticized outcomes favorable to police in investigations involving the deaths of African-American men, now must decide if the autopsy findings are sufficient to order the arrests of the other three officers. Calls for their arrest have become a rallying cry of protesters, while the anger over Floyd’s death has degenerated into the country’s worst race riots since the 1960s. In Minnesota, a state that was under a coronavirus-triggered stay-at-home order until May 18 and where gatherings of 10 or more individuals are still prohibited, thousands of people went to the governor’s mansion in St. Paul, the state capital, on Monday to air their demands. “One down, three to go” and “Lock them all four” were two of the chants heard at that peaceful demonstration. The state’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, was booed by protesters when he stepped outside. But he listened to accounts from people at the scene who said they had been victims of police brutality. On Monday night, authorities arrested dozens of people who violated a curfew in Minneapolis, where the chaos, looting and arson attacks of previous days appear to have subsided.",0.0

Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland put the curfew in place Monday night to prevent protests from becoming violent. The city has announced the curfew will remain in effect Tuesday night from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Protest organizers are still planning a peaceful protest/march for Tuesday night. Monday night’s protest was also peaceful. It was the sixth night of protest in Memphis calling for justice for George Floyd and victims of police brutality. The march began at Clayborn Temple and went through downtown. Eventually, the group of demonstrators were met by police in riot gear downtown. Leaders of the group asked if they could pass to continue and the march ended at 201 Poplar. Protesters faced a risk when it came to how late they were out because Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland issued a civil emergency and a curfew Monday night from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. If people broke the curfew they would face a Class A misdemeanor. This comes after Memphis Police Director Mike Rallings said there were clashes with police and several businesses vandalized in Sunday night’s protest. Strickland says he supports the protest but he feels there have been two different groups with different intentions. “We will continue this curfew as long as necessary. What this means is if you’re out during those hours you can be arrested,” said Strickland. Since Wednesday when protests began in the city, Rallings says police have made 44 arrests. The civil emergency that was issued will last until June 8. Mayor Strickland says some people are exempt from the curfew including those who have essential employment, safety or health reasons.

Esto se produce después de que el director de policía de Memphis, Mike Rallings, dijo que hubo enfrentamientos con la policía y varios negocios destrozados en la protesta del domingo por la noche. Strickland dice que apoya las protestas, pero siente que ha habido dos grupos diferentes con diferentes intenciones. “Continuaremos este toque de queda el tiempo que sea necesario.

Polls began to close Tuesday night as voters navigated curfews and health concerns in a slate of primary contests that tested the nation's ability to host elections amid dueling crises and moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held elections, including four that delayed their April contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden easily won Indiana, which was the first state to begin closing polls at 7 p.m. Voting continued across Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania, two places rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. The dynamic was especially intense in Washington, where Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed a 7 p.m. curfew as law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops prepared for a fifth night of social unrest near the White House. A large fence was erected in front of the White House and military vehicles blocked some streets in downtown. While voters cast ballots from Maryland to Montana, Pennsylvania offered the day's biggest trove of delegates. The state also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. In-person voting numbers were down in every state as many voters were encouraged to vote by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic. Yet there were reports of long lines, particularly in minority communities in the Philadelphia area, where election officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. ""Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,"" Kramer said. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination. If he doesn't secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month. Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as ""more interested in power than in principle."" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. ""People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,"" Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party's platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. ""Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,"" Autiello said. ""So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important."" In Washington, the mayor ordered a 7 p.m. curfew, though voting places will be open until 8 p.m. Voting has been deemed essential, and city officials say voters will not be subject to arrest if they cast ballots during the curfew. Philadelphia moved its 6 p.m. curfew back to 8:30 p.m. for Tuesday to accommodate voting. ""We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,"" said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday ""to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place."" Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections, Idaho and Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and is now focused on other offices. ""We think we're prepared,"" Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairwoman Nancy Patton Mills said. ""Thank goodness we have the opportunity of working this out in the primary because we don't know where we'll be with the pandemic in November.""",0.0

I was 5 years old the first time I heard the n-word. I had no idea what it meant, but I remember that everyone “ooh’ed” and “um’ed” as I sat confused. Even with the reactions, I did not know that it was something that should offend me. This was just the beginning of the memories. Another memory was in fourth grade when a friend was having a slumber party and advised that she could not invite me because I was black. Unlike my first experiences of racism, fourth-grade me knew this was messed up and that only certain people were affected. Since born and raised in the South, our parents educated us on racism and discrimination. Since both my sister and I went to college and on to have decent careers, the adversity seemed to have the opposite of the intended impact. Please don’t worry if this doesn’t resonate.

1623684426,2020-06-02 16:51:00,6 Atlanta Officers Charged After Release Of 'Disturbing' Arrest Video,https://www.wknofm.org/post/6-atlanta-officers-charged-after-release-disturbing-arrest-video,en,False,,90047,wknofm.org,http://wknofm.org/#spider,"Six Atlanta police officers are facing a slew of charges for their role in the arrest of two young people last weekend. The incident, during which officers used stun guns on the pair and pulled them from their vehicle, received national attention after bystanders recorded and posted video to social media. ""I agree with Mayor [Keisha Lance] Bottoms and I agree with our police chief, Erika Shields, when they both have conveyed in so many separate ways that the conduct in this incident — it is not indicative of the way that we treat people in the city of Atlanta,"" Fulton County, Ga., District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters Tuesday. Howard's office has filed charges — mostly assorted aggravated assault and battery counts — against a half-dozen officers involved in the arrest: Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Streeter and Gardner have been fired from the force since Saturday's confrontation, while three others have been placed on desk duty. Howard said the charges are backed up by extensive interviews with the young couple, Taniyah Pilgrim and Messiah Young, as well as video evidence from bystanders and the officers' body camera footage. The district attorney played one such video from a bodycam. During the video, officers on foot confront Pilgrim and Young, who had been passing them in a car. After the two black occupants appear to drive away briefly from the officers, Pilgrim and Young stop — at which point the officers swarm the vehicle. Stun guns are used on both occupants, who are ripped from the car over Pilgrim's screams to stop. Pilgrim was never charged; Young was charged with attempting to elude officers before the charge was dismissed at the request of the mayor, who apologized. ""We just need to see that all officers are held accountable, and that there really is change moving forward within the culture of policing,"" Young said at a news conference. Atlanta and other cities have seen widespread protests over the past week after another video — that of George Floyd's arrest in Minneapolis — catalyzed outrage over violence in policing. Floyd died after Derek Chauvin — who has since been fired from the Minneapolis police and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter — dug a knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Video of the incident involving Pilgrim and Young caused a stir of its own. ""We understand our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" the Atlanta mayor said Sunday, describing the video as ""disturbing on many levels."" ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.""  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In dozens of cities yesterday, large, mostly peaceful demonstrations devolved into chaos. In Nashville, Miami, Seattle and Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, New York and, frankly, too many other places to name, protesters expressed their rage at the death of George Floyd, police brutality and racism. There were violent confrontations with police, and police cracked down, also violently. There were also mass arrests and injuries among demonstrators, journalists and police. At least a dozen major cities declared curfews. Others called on the National Guard, which has been historically used in response to major civil unrest. There were scenes of National Guard marching through some residential neighborhoods, ordering people to stay inside. We go now to Los Angeles, where members of the National Guard were also deployed overnight and a curfew was put in place as a state of emergency was declared. NPR's Nathan Rott is in LA, and he joins us now. Nate, walk us through what happened yesterday. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: So there was a massive peaceful protest that started around noon yesterday. It was in the Fairfax district in west L.A., which is kind of a trendy neighborhood with high-end retail and a big outdoor mall. And people were protesting against police violence, as they are all over the country. They were memorializing George Floyd, the black man who died after being pinned to the ground by Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, by all accounts, it was peaceful, respectful until a little later in the afternoon, when we started seeing reports of police cars being set on fire and just a total breakdown in the situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This often happens at protests, right? When things shift as things go into the night. Do we know what happened? ROTT: Yeah. And that - honestly, that was a little surprising, Lulu. Usually, these, like, shifts do happen at night. And this started in broad daylight in mid-afternoon, which is, I think, very concerning to a lot of the city officials. So, you know, on social media, people were blaming the police for escalating tensions, for responding with tear gas and the sort of militarized riot gear that has become so commonplace around the country. City officials have so far blamed bad eggs in the crowd for setting things off, and that's something we've been hearing in a lot of places - that it's a small group of people who are agitating these situations. Of course, that's now been politicized, even with the U.S. attorney general blaming anarchists and leftists without, you know, providing any proof of that. But it's really hard to say what makes this situations shift. Tensions are obviously very high, so it doesn't take much to spark something. GARCIA-NAVARRO: No, it doesn't. We saw videos of looting and fires in many cities around the country last night. That was also the case in LA, right? ROTT: Yeah. A number of retail stores in that Fairfax area were broken into. Goods were stolen. Some were set on fire. I know firefighters were dealing with those fires throughout the night. That prompted LA's mayor, Eric Garcetti, to announce a citywide curfew, which caught a lot of people off guard because he announced it an hour before it went into effect. But here he is explaining why they did it and alluding to violent protests in 1992 following Rodney King. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: We've seen this before in Los Angeles. When the violence escalates, no one wins. And so everybody has to be responsible for owning this moment. Whether you wear a badge or whether you hold a sign, I'm asking all of Los Angeles to take a deep breath and to step back for a moment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does it seem like the curfew worked briefly? ROTT: Yeah, the crowds started to thin out even before the curfew started. I know in other parts of the state - Sacramento, San Diego - there were large confrontations between crowds and police. I think, you know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Nate Rott in LA. Thank you so much. ROTT: Yeah. Thank you, Lulu.

1623684425,2020-06-02 17:27:00,Pelosi Asks Black Caucus To Come Up With Police Reforms Following Protests,https://www.wknofm.org/post/pelosi-asks-black-caucus-come-police-reforms-following-protests,en,False,,90047,wknofm.org,http://wknofm.org/#spider,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has asked the Congressional Black Caucus to lead the process of drafting a legislative response to the protests that have swept the country following the death of George Floyd. House Democrats are sorting through dozens of proposals to address policing issues, including excessive use of force and racial profiling. ""It is time, it is time for us to address the concerns that were being expressed by the protesters,"" Pelosi said at a press event at the Capitol Tuesday. ""This is not a single incident. We know this is a pattern of behavior. and we also know the history that brings us to this sad place."" Democrats hope to calm the increasingly incendiary atmosphere in the country over Floyd's death by finding ways to address the underlying systemic problems enraging protesters in the streets. There is some degree of bipartisan support for reviewing the tactics that led to Floyd's death. Many Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have acknowledged what McConnell called ""egregious wrongs."" McConnell said Tuesday there could be a role for Congress to play here. ""It's certainly something that we need to take a look at,"" McConnell told reporters. ""We'll be talking to our colleagues about what, if anything, is appropriate for us to do in the wake of what's going on."" But the discussion has often become entwined with public outcry over President Trump's handling of the unrest and his threat to use military force to quell protests. Pelosi said Floyd's killing ""happened in broad daylight, it happened for all the world to see. A knee to the neck, not only by the perpetrator of that murder but by three officers observing it."" Congress has often struggled to address policing issues. Many decisions about policing tactics, training and strategies are determined at the state and local level. Pelosi is asking members of the Congressional Black Caucus to sort through the ideas and find legislation that can pass the House where Democrats have enough votes for approval without GOP support. Among the options is a 2015 bill introduced by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that would outlaw the use of chokeholds in policing. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has endorsed that idea. Democrats are hoping to reach an agreement quickly. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters he could call lawmakers back to Washington to vote before their scheduled return on June 30. Hoyer said that he has been in contact with the Congressional Black Caucus over the last four days and that it is considering more than 50 pieces of legislation, including a proposal to end qualified immunity for police officers, or their legal protection shield for certain actions. Democrats also plan to try to force the Senate to go on record condemning Trump for ""ordering federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against Americans who were peaceably protesting"" Monday outside the White House. The resolution, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would also affirm the rights of free assembly and protest while condemning looting. The measure is unlikely to pass as it requires unanimous consent to be approved. Republicans, including McConnell, have largely focused on calling for protests to remain peaceful without directly discussing the conflict at the White House. ""It is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace in our streets and peace in our communities,"" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""We need to unite against these violent rioters who seek only to aggrandize themselves and further damage a nation that needs healing."" Most Senate Republicans declined Tuesday to discuss the tear gas incident at the White House when reporters on Capitol Hill asked them about it. Some avoided the question; others said they didn't see the incident. Those who did speak to reporters mostly focused on condemning violent protests. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has announced a June 16 hearing on police use of force. ""We intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd's death, with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation,"" Graham said in a statement Friday. ",0.0

Turner said he planned to march with protesters after a candlelight vigil at Founders Park, but part of the group had already left and blocked State of Franklin and University Parkway before the service was over. Dozens of officers from four agencies — JCPD, Greeneville Police, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office and the Tennessee Highway Patrol — responded to the protest after people began blocking the road, Turner said. Eleven people were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and blocking a roadway. Turner noted that seven were not from Johnson City. He also said one man was charged with having a weapon. It was found after the man was taken to jail and a detention center officer was searching his property. According to their arrest reports, nine of the 11 were from the Tri-Cities area and all of them were from Tennessee. Three were from Johnson City, two were from Jonesborough, two were from Elizabethton, two were from Kingsport, one was from Seymour and one was from Silver Point. Arrested were: Devin Absher, 23, Seymour; Elizabeth Allen, 18, Elizabethton; Katlyn Ayers, 20, Jonesborough; Dezmond Carpenter, 20, Johnson City; Benjamin Flanary, 34, Kingsport; Wesley Frost, 29, Johnson City; Jayden Jennings, 19, Kingsport; Katlyn Kreisa, 19, Elizabethton; Naythan Matherly, 19, Jonesborough; Frederick Psioda, 19, Johnson City; and Morgan Roberts, Silver Point. They were all arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and blocking lanes of travel. Carpenter was additionally charged with unlawful possession of a firearm and served with outstanding warrants charging him with aggravated robbery and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. “They ignored request from officers to exit the roadway and allow traffic to resume,” Turner said about the protesters. “We tried to persuade them to go onto the sidewalk and continue the protest, but that didn’t happen. The protesters traveled up and down State of Franklin, including coming here to City Hall, for a couple of hours. “Officers followed behind them and in front of them to try to keep traffic from striking those protesters,” he said. “After they left City Hall, they returned to State of Franklin and blocked the intersection again at University Parkway. At that time it was getting dark, and our concern was that motorists would not be able to see them as well as during the daylight hours, so we met with them again and tried to persuade them to continue their protest on the sidewalk. When they refused, with the help of some other agencies, we were able to start making arrests.” All those arrested were freed Tuesday. An online fundraiser to provide bail money for them brought in more than $12,000 by Tuesday afternoon. The organizer of the fundraiser said any leftover funds would be put toward bail for future protesters arrested and Black Lives Matter organizations. Another rally was planned for Tuesday night, and Turner said police would try to meet with protest leaders to “discuss ways they can protest peacefully without breaking the law where they won’t have any interaction with police. We’re there to protect their right to protest but we can’t allow protesters to disrupt order and break the law as they’re getting their message out.” Turner said the city had reached out to the group to talk about ways of protesting peacefully. “We’ll have our officers here again in case there are problems we need to address,” he said. Brock said the city needs protests like last week’s when the gatherings were peaceful and everyone’s voice could be heard. “Last week, protests over the murder of George Floyd began in Johnson City,” Brock said. “These protests called for justice and equality. Outrage and heartache were prevalent. We all felt it, and we still do. Those protesters marched in a lawful way. They spoke in a voice that we could hear. That is the action we need.” She and a group of young protesters have been trying to meet to discuss the relationship in the community between officials and the public. “We have worked with activists over the last five days to begin a dialogue focused on solutions. We want to know, we want to understand and we want to do better. This is the pact we must keep. Unlawful or violent protests won’t lead to progress. We mustn’t let those who want chaos hijack the efforts of those that want change. “We are meeting with these young people and we have tasked them to come up with their ideas and their action items that we can consider. There’s a petition for change being circulated in the community. That is how difference is made. That is what leads to a better community.” Turner said he’s willing to talk to the protesters about their ideas for change, but it can’t happen in the middle of the street. “It’s our desire to stay united with the community and the cause and the cause not be pushed to the back because of the actions of some,” Turner said. “I don’t think what they’re protesting for should be defined by what happened last night because I think as they go forward they can do things the right way.” “The conversation has been about what happened to Mr. George Floyd and that we don’t want that to happen in our city and we also don’t want the type of violence, riots, to happen in our city,” Turner said. City Manager Pete Peterson said there had not been any need to implement a curfew, as other cities in the nation have.",0.0

Four states were originally scheduled to vote in April but delayed their contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Pennsylvania offers the day's biggest trove of delegates and represents a high-profile test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in one of the most important general election battlegrounds. ""We think we're prepared,"" Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairwoman Nancy Patton Mills said. ""Thank goodness we have the opportunity of working this out in the primary because we don't know where we'll be with the pandemic in November."" Joe Biden needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination, but his role as his party's clear presidential nominee is not in danger should he fall short. With a dominant showing on Super Tuesday in early March, the former vice president pushed out all his major opponents. He will almost certainly secure the needed delegates later in the month if necessary. Still, Tuesday offers a historic opportunity for the 77-year-old Democrat, who is waging his third presidential campaign and who hopes to amass as many delegates as possible to show strength before going up against President Donald Trump. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. ""People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,"" Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party's platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests following the killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a 7 p.m. curfew, though voting places will be open until 8 p.m. Voting has been deemed essential, and city officials say voters will not be subject to arrest if they cast ballots during the curfew. It's much the same in Philadelphia, where officials have promised that voters would not be arrested should their city's 6 p.m. curfew be extended for a fourth consecutive night. ""We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,"" said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday ""to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place."" Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Idaho, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Another state holding primary elections, Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and focused on other offices.",0.0
1623693427,2020-06-02 15:18:42,Black female mayors in spotlight amid protests and pandemic,https://www.southernstandard.com/tennessee-covid-19-updates/black-female-mayors-spotlight-amid-protests-and-pandemic/,en,True,,585956,southernstandard.com,http://southernstandard.com/,"By KAT STAFFORD Associated Press DETROIT (AP) — Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms captured the nation's attention when she addressed the civil unrest occurring in her city after George Floyd's death. ""I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old,"" Bottoms said Friday in a rousing speech. ""When I saw the murder of George Floyd, I hurt like a mother."" Bottoms and other black female mayors, including Lori Lightfoot of Chicago, are leading some of the nation's largest cities during an unprecedented moment of challenge as protests against police brutality overlap with the coronavirus pandemic and an economic collapse. They're being praised as thoughtful leaders at a time of political tumult and high-profile examples of black women seeking and winning political office across the country. Higher Heights for America PAC, a political action committee dedicated to electing more progressive black women, said there are seven black women serving as mayors in the nation's 100 most populous U.S. cities, compared to just one in 2014. ""Black women have always been leading and we have been the defenders of our homes, our communities and our nation,"" said Glynda Carr, the president and CEO of Higher Heights. ""Our leadership was built for this moment and their unique experiences as black women, not only as Americans, has provided the type of trusted leadership that can help move this country forward."" The mayors have demonstrated leadership with personal connections. Lightfoot, Chicago's first black female mayor and first openly gay leader, frankly acknowledged America's dark history of racism and blasted President Donald Trump's divisive tweets in which he called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" ""It's impossible for me as a black woman who has been the target of blatant racism over the course of my life not to take the killing of George Floyd personally,"" Lightfoot said. ""Being black in America should not be a death sentence."" The question is whether this moment will translate into a long-lasting higher profile for the mayors. Bottoms, for example, was already believed to be under consideration as Joe Biden's running mate before the protests. Her stature has only risen amid the unrest. Beyond her well-received remarks Friday, she acted swiftly two days later, firing two police officers and placing three others on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest arrest involving two college students. ""Use of excessive force is never acceptable,"" Bottoms told reporters. Nadia Brown, a political science professor at Purdue University, said her research has found that many black female leaders, especially within their own communities, are seen as relatable figures — something that has worked in their favor at this time. During the pandemic, residents made viral memes of Lightfoot enforcing her stay-at-home orders. Instead of chiding them, Lightfoot embraced the moment and used it to connect with residents, Brown said. ""I think that we're seeing some of this play out in real time,"" Brown said. ""She was speaking in that role of telling residents what to do from an authority figure that seemed very familiar. And I think that's kind of a mode in which we're seeing some other black women elected officials deal with unrest in that they're speaking to constituents not just as an authority figure but one that is familiar."" Rochester, New York, Mayor Lovely Warren, who is in her second term as the first black female mayor of the state's third-largest city, said that while black women have made strides in gaining prominence, they still face unique challenges of racism and stereotypes. ""We're trying to fight a system that was institutionally built to create the disparities that it has created over generations and so we're trying to undo the damage that has been done to prepare our children for the future,"" Warren said. ""A lot of times we get branded with the 'angry black woman syndrome' when we're speaking up to a number of different issues that impact our community, but we have been built to take on the responsibility and we take it in stride."" ""No matter which mayor I look at across this country right now, they have done an extraordinary job trying to balance all that's coming toward them,"" Warren added. Other black mayors including San Francisco's London Breed and Muriel Bowser of Washington have also been recognized for their measured responses and handling of their communities. A'shanti Gholar, president of Emerge America, an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office, said many of the black women in office today were entrenched in grassroots political work for decades, paving the way for those to come behind them. ""This is about a movement, a movement of women extending and taking their leadership all over across the country,"" Gholar said. ""Black women running for office and winning, it isn't an anomaly. They're also building up the next generation of black women elected officials and black women mayors who they're inspiring to run."" Although gains have been made, Carr said there's still much more work to be done. Biden has pledged to pick a woman as a running mate and is considering several women of color. No black woman has ever served as governor in the country. Carr noted that black women make up 7.6% of the country's population yet account for just 4.3% of all members of the House and 1% of the Senate. ""All that we celebrate about the gains we made 51 years after Shirley Chisholm became the first black woman to serve in Congress, we also recognize that the 23 million black women in this country are so underrepresented and underserved,"" Carr said. ""So, we need to continue to invest in recruiting, training and supporting black woman.""",0.0

The S&P 500 was up 0.2% after shedding some of its early gains. Financial, industrial and other stocks that would stand to benefit the most from a growing economy moved higher. Energy companies also rose as the price of crude oil headed higher. Technology and communication services stocks were among the laggards. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. The modest gains have the S&P 500 on track for a three-day winning streak, extending the benchmark index's remarkable two-month rally off a steep skid in February and March as broad swaths of the U.S. economy ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Wall Street's momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, spurring threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 125 points, or 0.5%, to 25,599. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology companies, fell 0.4% after having been up 0.2%. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.6%. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early Tuesday to kick off trading on the Nasdaq. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. In Europe, France's CAC 40 jumped 2% Tuesday as the country opened restaurants, cafes, parks and beaches and launched a contract tracing app to help keep tabs on new contagions. Germany's DAX, which had been closed Monday, caught up with previous global markets' gains and surged 3.7%. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.9%. Markets in Asia closed broadly higher. While more countries and sectors are reopening, activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. And fears persist about a possible resurgence in coronavirus outbreaks in some countries. There were 34 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on Tuesday, seeming to reaffirm growing risks as people begin to mingle more in crowded commuter trains with the reopenings of more offices, schools, restaurants and stores. The daily numbers had dropped below 20 recently. Bond yields were mostly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.67% from 0.66% late Monday. Oil prices rose. Benchmark U.S. crude oil for July delivery was up 2.3% to $36.25 a barrel. Brent crude oil for August delivery rose 2.6% to $39.31 a barrel.",0.0

Biden said Trump's ""narcissism has become more important than the nation that he leads."" The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee delivered a speech at Philadelphia's City Hall, addressing the civil unrest across America following the death of George Floyd. Biden said ""the moment has come"" to deal with systemic racism and deeply ingrained economic inequality — and insisted that the nation can't wait until November's election and its outcome. ""I call on the Congress to act this month,"" Biden said, urging lawmakers to start ""with real police reform"" and citing proposed legislation outlawing choke holds. But Biden stepped up his criticism of Trump as he works to elevate his voice in the national debate — after more than two months of the campaign for the White House being frozen amid the outbreak of the coronavirus. ""This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,"" Biden said, adding that Trump is ""consumed with his blinding ego."" Biden's criticism comes a day after Trump threatened the nation's governors that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation. Authorities under federal command later forced back peaceful demonstrators in Washington with tear gas so the president could walk to nearby church St. John's Church and pose briefly with a Bible. The church had sustained damage during Sunday protests. Biden noted that ""peaceful protesters"" were dispersed from the ""doorstep of the people's house, the White House"" using tear gas and flash grenades to stage what he called a ""photo op"" publicity stunt. ""The president held up a Bible,"" Biden added. ""I just wished he opened it once in awhile instead of brandishing it."" The 20-plus minute address was covered live by cable networks and Biden used it to declare, ""This job's not about me. It's about you. It's about us."" ""Look, the presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either,"" Biden said, but promised, ""I won't fan the flames of hate."" As the former vice president spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia grapples with sustained violent protests. Several adjacent businesses — banks, convenience stores and hotels were boarded up. A very small audience, including Mayor Jim Kenney, was on hand. Biden is trying to create a stark contrast with Trump, who has embraced the language of confrontation and war, casting himself as the ""president of law and order."" Trump signaled he would stake his reelection on convincing voters his forceful approach was warranted in a time of national tumult and racial unrest. ""I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country – not use them for political gain,"" Biden said.",0.0

(WATE) — Local businesses are sharing how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the recent protests following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota have affected them — and how they’re adapting to changing times. The COVID-19 pandemic completely shut down most restaurants and forced others to find creative ways to keep the income flowing. WATE 6 On Your Side spoke to two restaurants that have locations in Market Square, which has seen recent protests after reopening amid the pandemic. “Its been challenging, it’s really taken everything we have to sustain for ourselves, for our staff members,” Café 4 manager, Demetrios Klonaris, said. “We started curbside after shutting down for almost eight weeks. Curbside was going okay, we had great support from a lot of community members, we really appreciated all the business but it was nothing like being open,” Klonaris said. The Tomato Head restaurant also just barely made it through the pandemic, saying their Kingston Pike location remaining open for to-go orders is what kept their downtown location afloat. Recent turmoil from around the country has caused increased activity in the downtown area, but managers say peaceful protests have actually drawn more business to local restaurants. RELATED: Peaceful demonstrators march through downtown Knoxville “If anything, it helped us. We had a few hungry and tired people coming in after the protest and we fed them,” The Tomato Head manager, Jackson Lloyd, said. As Knox County continues with reopening under the phase 2 guidelines, both businesses say they hope customers will continue to come in. They are still closely following guidelines — keeping customers at a safe distance, wearing masks and disinfecting. LATEST STORIES",0.0

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks.

Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

Lamberth, R-Portland, has filed an amendment to an existing bill to require that anyone charged with rioting be detained in law enforcement custody for at least 12 hours, as well as face a minimum jail sentence of 30 days if convicted of the crime. The amendment to House Bill 2620 is scheduled to be taken up in the House judiciary committee Tuesday night. That bill, which raises the fine for aggravated assault, was sponsored by Rep. Michael Curcio, R-Dickson, who chairs the committee. A protester spray paints the outside of the Metro Courthouse in Nashville, Tenn., Saturday, May 30, 2020 after the “I Will Breathe” rally to protest the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after being pinned down by a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day. (Photo: Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean) ""We have had a large number of peaceful protesters that have made it clear they don’t want these rioters ruining their message,"" Lamberth said, referencing events in Saturday on Nashville that turned violent as a peaceful rally downtown devolved into mayhem. Following an ""I Will Breathe"" rally to protest police brutality, a demonstration that had been organized by established community activists and was attended by public officials, a smaller group began smashing and attempting to set fire to a Nashville police cruiser outside of the police department's Central Precinct. The group then moved to the historic Metro Courthouse and city hall — painting graffiti on walls along the way — where people in the group began breaking windows, setting fires, spray-painting more explicit graffiti and knocking down light poles before smashing storefronts downtown. Two men so far have been charged in connection with the courthouse arson and vandalism, though only one of them faces a rioting charge. State law defines a riot as three or more people gathering and engaging in ""tumultuous and violent conduct"" that ""creates grave danger of substantial damage to property or serious bodily injury to persons or substantially obstructs law enforcement or other governmental function."" It's a misdemeanor, though it becomes a felony if substantial property damage occurs or someone who isn't a participant is injured. Rep. William Lamberth stands to speak as the Tennessee House of Representatives began their session this week in Nashville, Tenn.

(Photo: Larry McCormack / The Tennessean) ""If someone is arrested for rioting, we want them away from peaceful protesters for at least 12 hours,"" Lamberth said. ""The goal of this bill is to separate the criminal element from our peaceful, law-abiding citizens who are simply trying to make sure that their issues are heard."" Adam Kleinheider, a spokesman for Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge, said it's unlikely"" that the Senate takes up the bill, which is not on a committee calendar or on its list of priority legislation for the remainder of session. McNally and Senate leadership have said they're focused only on bills directly related to the coronavirus pandemic, making adjustments to the budget, or time-sensitive matters, a position that is at odds with the House's plans to continue passing a wide range of bills. Kleinheider said Sen. John Stevens, R-Huntingdon and the sponsor of the bill, hasn't requested that it be considered to fall into any of those categories.

Public health experts said Monday that it generally takes five to seven days for symptoms of the virus to surface in new cases, and generally a little more than twice that long for the most severe cases of the virus to cause hospitalizations and deaths. Protests in Nashville and other cities will also likely “substantially inhibit” efforts to slow the virus through contact tracing, which is inherently dependent on trust in the government, said Dr. William Schaffner, a renown infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Contact tracing is a practice by which public health investigators meticulously interview people with coronavirus to find others who might also be infected. The tactic is reliant on people knowing who they spent time with and being willing to give this information to the government. “If there is not trust, these people who are asked are going to be reluctant to participate,” Schaffner said. “This is a particular concern in the African-American community, because that’s a community most affected and where the trust is least.” Thousands hit the streets of Nashville on Saturday for a peaceful rally followed by pockets of violence and vandalism that damaged city hall and other downtown buildings. A smaller vigil and protest followed in Murfreesboro on Sunday. Both events were spurred by the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed by a white police officer who pinned him to the ground with a knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25. The death has inflamed simmering tensions between people of color and law enforcement, leading to a week of rallies, protests, marches and riots in cities across the United States. Protest crowds gathered just as those same cities are attempting to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected about 1.7 million Americans and killed more than 103,000. In Nashville, the virus has been detected in 5,517 people – including 4,165 who have already recovered – and killed at least 63. The Nashville outbreak has plateaued in recent weeks, and city leaders have cautiously lifted restrictions on residents and businesses in an effort to return to a semblance of normal life. Dr. Alex Jahangir, chairman of the Nashville Board of Health and head of the city’s coronavirus task force, said he did not believe attendance at the protests alone was a reason to be tested for the virus. But Jahangir stressed anyone who develops symptoms should get tested and anyone who is “concerned” they were exposed is welcome to get tested, regardless of if they were at the protest or not. “The mere fact of being at any of the rallies or protests this weekend, I would not say you necessarily need to get tested,” Jahangir said. “But if you do need to be tested, or you are worried about it, we have community assessment centers and we have our hotline if you want to speak to someone further.” Schaffner described the protests as a worrisome combination of factors: Protesters spent hours in close proximity, shouting and chanting, potentially passing infected droplets back and forth; and because they were protesting racial injustice, many in the crowd were people of color, who already disproportionately affected by coronavirus. The only good news, he said, is the protests occurred outside, where the virus appears less likely to spread, and that many of the protesters wore masks. “And all of this happened as we were opening up society generally,” Schaffner said. “So if COVID-19 came to the demonstrations and was spread … it will be a little harder to determine if the demonstrations were the accelerator.”",0.0
1623713970,2020-06-02 17:53:42,Cities erupt in more violence as Trump decries 'lowlifes',https://www.columbiadailyherald.com/news/20200602/cities-erupt-in-more-violence-as-trump-decries-8216lowlifes8217?rssfeed=true,en,False,,106478,columbiadailyherald.com,http://columbiadailyherald.com/,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump stepped up the pressure on governors to crack down after a week of unrest set off by the death of George Floyd, demanding New York call in the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As cities around the U.S. witnessed a seventh straight night of both peaceful demonstrations and bursts of theft, vandalism and attacks on police, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast! Don’t make the same horrible and deadly mistake you made with the Nursing Homes!!!” In New York on Monday night, people smashed shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breached the doors of Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street despite the first curfew in the city in decades. Police said nearly 700 people were arrested and several officers injured in the overnight violence. New York and other cities braced for more unrest after nightfall Tuesday, with Mayor Bill de Blasio extending an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He said he would do that with the help of community leaders, urging them to step forward: “Create peace. … Stand up.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the unrest. New York is not among them. De Blasio has said he does not want the National Guard, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said he will not send it into the city against the mayor’s wishes. Violence gripped communities from coast to coast again on Monday night, with police officers shot, run over and showered with rocks and bottles. In Philadelphia, hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city. In Atlanta, police fired tear gas at demonstrators. In Nashville, more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters. And at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, an SUV plowed into a group of officers, injuring three. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ‘Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this … again.’” Democratic governors and mayors rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, questioning whether the federal government has such authority and warning that such a step would be incendiary. De Blasio said military troops would create “a dangerous scenario,” while Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock likewise warned such a move would just lead to more violence and destruction. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” they said in a statement. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump’s threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. The president was not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The unrest in Minneapolis, meanwhile, appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes, even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer’s condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. Sending the military into the states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev.

Lindell Street. Throughout Saturday afternoon, social media posts claimed MPD Lt. John Cross made a threat of bodily harm against resident Adrian Oliver, who was apparently downtown during Saturday morning’s organized solidarity protest in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Pictures of Oliver and Cross were posted to Facebook and cell phone footage showed the officer accused of making threats and demands for Cross to turn on his body camera. Oliver viewed the body camera footage at the police department and later apologized on social media for the reported claims that went viral on Facebook. Oliver was apparently in a verbal exchange with a driver of a vehicle who stopped in the middle of S. Lindell Street in downtown Martin during the protest and during the traffic stop. Oliver requested to file a complaint against the driver who had reportedly engaged in the verbal exchange at the MPD Monday afternoon. He has reportedly received anonymous messages of death threats since the incident. This is the link to a copy of the MPD officer’s body camera footage from the traffic stop Saturday in its entirety.

They walked from Legislative Plaza to the Capitol to stand in front of National Guard troops. One of the protesters asked the guardsmen to drop their shields and they did.

1623724006,2020-06-02 15:25:05,What My Family Saw at the Nashville I Will Breathe Rally,https://thedispatch.com/p/what-my-family-saw-at-the-nashville,en,False,,658835,State News - United States - Tennessee,http://www.tennessee.statenews.net/,"My husband David and I sought counsel from friends and family. We were considering whether we should take Naomi, our 12-year old daughter, to Nashville’s “I Will Breathe” rally Saturday organized by local groups, such as the Brother’s Round Table, Keva Inc., Equity Alliance, and the NAACP. Riots had already broken out across the nation, and the city of Atlanta was under siege. Naomi, originally from Ethiopia, had been targeted by racists before, but we’d largely protected her from it. (Listen to David talk about what we experienced during the 2016 election on NPR here.) Most advised us not to take her, because of the possible damage that could be inflicted from the words of a single counter-protester. We decided to take her anyway. We know that Naomi will face racism. She already has. But we wanted her to experience what it’s like to take it on—to go on the offensive, with her family by her side, surrounded by people who stood with her also. No doubt she’ll at some point encounter racism alone. Saturday, however, we wanted to confront it together. We wanted her to learn how to fight, or at least brace against, evil. On Friday night, my 19-year old son Austin, Naomi, and I stayed up late making T-shirts and signs, wondering what would happen. Here’s what we saw. In the daytime, peace reigned. The rally in Legislative Plaza was a peaceful family event. I was relieved as we walked to the event to see other moms and dads bringing their children to the rally; some were even younger than Naomi. Even though we were late, we ended up—Forrest Gump-style—right next to the speakers, who wore masks and spoke into a megaphone. They included Nashville Mayor John Cooper, state Sen. Brenda Gilmore, state Rep. Vincent Dixie, state Rep. Mike Stewart, and state Rep. Harold Love (all Democrats). When Mayor Cooper was interrupted, event organizers demanded the crowd hear him out. They did. A minor scuffle occurred a distance away from us, but the crowd began to chant—“We want peace!”—until passions cooled moments later. More than 4,000 people attended the well—ordered event, and it was simultaneously filled with goodwill, disappointment, and genuine grief. The march after the rally was laden with emotion. The rally ended at 5 p.m. as scheduled, but some of the crowd spilled out onto the streets of historic downtown Nashville. Marching in America carries a certain patriotic gravity and emotional resonance. Rarely in my life have I been in a crowd where such unbridled, complex emotion—grief, bitterness, fury, joy, sadness, pride—was on display all at once. Someone yelled out the names of African Americans who’ve been killed by police brutality and the crowd yelled back, “We will not forget.” Others chanted “f---” Donald Trump,” “hands up, don’t shoot,” and “no justice, no peace, no racist police.” Along the way, members of an organization were handing out cards in case people were arrested and needed bail. People on the side of the road were giving out free water. As we walked, people in the buildings looked out their windows, and barflies in the honky tonks looked down from their outdoor, elevated balconies. “You’re strong,” I said to a mother carrying a baby in a car seat. “You gotta be for your kids.” She handed her sign to another person so she could switch the weight of the carseat to the other arm. Agitators were among us, and we could feel the coming violence. But the “family event vibe” lessened with every step of the march. Along the way, I heard a loud sound behind me—not loud enough for a gunshot, but the protesters, already on alert, scurried. A person had thrown a brick at one of the Nashville downtown buildings. Then another. The glass held. When the protesters came to a complete stop in front of the Metro Nashville Police Department’s Central Precinct, I got worried. My late uncle Gary Moss, the first Metro police officer to have a canine partner, had worked at that very station. People pulled out brought huge cement blocks, bricks, and gallons of whole milk (to neutralize pepper spray). Bricks flew through the air, hitting the windows. The protesters near me wondered why we stopped. “Aren’t we marching?” they asked. We weren’t. In a flash, our peaceful march turned into the beginnings of the riot that would later run rampant through historic Music City. Naomi and I left. It was time to go. White allies are necessary, but some whites aren’t allies at all. When the police came through in riot gear, understandably worried black protesters asked white allies to make a barrier between the cops and the African American crowd, worried that Nashville cops would lash out at black protestors. Some white people volunteered, others refused. Though no violence had broken out at that point, it was gratifying to see some white people offer to help at least in a small way. Other whites in attendance were unfortunately unhinged. Without question, the most hysterical and fury-filled people I witnessed were white. (This was an observation echoed around the nation.) I was only there from 3 p.m. until around 6 p.m. local time. But while I was there, I saw one white guy push an officer with all his might. He stumbled a few feet before catching himself. White people threw bricks. One white person picked up the excrement from police horses and put it on a police car with smashed windows. Another white person cheered as the car was damaged. When they returned to the street, a black man admonished them. He explained that black people couldn’t act that way without getting punished. Also, he said that people would see the damage to the police cars and blame blacks. “I couldn’t do that s--T,” he said, pointing out their privilege. “Then you walk the f--- away. Y’all ain’t f---ing grown.” It was absurd that a black man had to step up to white people ruining a civil rights rally. How sad that there’s no respite anywhere from racism popping up and ruining things. His indignation was inspirational, and I’m glad we witnessed it before we left. I wish it could be injected into every American’s veins. The Nashville police showed admirable restraint and professionalism. Like many of you, I’ve seen videos of police across America being harsh, careless, and brutal with protestors. Not so in Nashville. The police formed a wide perimeter around the marchers, their main goal seemingly to let people protest and stay off the interstates. When the police on horses came through the crowd, people screamed at them, kicked the horses, sprayed them with water, and hit them with full water bottles. (I saw someone hit an officer with an actual drum.) My son saw a brick bounce off a window and hit an officer in the head. Some people were walking around the crowds smoking marijuana, then going up to police officers and blowing the smoke in their mask-covered faces. Protesters got close to one female white officer and taunted her about her children. They got in the face of a black officer and called him a traitor to his race. Both officers, visibly upset at the interactions, stayed in formation. Not all of these exchanges were negative. After Officer Garren Hoskins and the protester in front of him talked about their mutual Christian faith, the protester put down his sign down and the two prayed together. Without exception, the officers let the protests occur, did their job, and did not retaliate. Protest organizers condemned violence. The Equity Alliance tweeted, “Today's protest was peaceful and unified. We witnessed white people defacing public property while marching and told them to stop. The people now attempting to set fire to the Metro Courthouse right now are NOT associated with today's peaceful protest rally. It ain't us.” (The person eventually arrested for setting fire to our historic courthouse was a 25 year old white male.) When the rioting escalated—well after we left —Mayor Cooper issued an emergency order, police issued a 10 p.m. curfew, and Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee mobilized the National Guard. Order was quickly restored, and the Ryman auditorium—a sacred place for country music fans –suffered one broken window. It was poignant to walk past officers as the crowd yelled “f--- the police” repeatedly. The cops didn’t move, wince, or even act bothered at the crowd’s exercise of their First Amendment rights. In a time of national angst, it’s good to remember how much freedom we actually have and how many police still show admirable restraint and discipline. But that notion isn’t a comfort to George Floyd or the millions of people mourning his loss. Because he—with his hands in cuffs and an officer’s boot on his neck—couldn’t brace himself against evil.

1623724018,2020-06-02 14:48:34,Lindsay Ell Reflects on Nashville Protests- 'A Beautiful Moment',https://tasteofcountry.com/lindsay-ell-nashville-george-floyd-protests/,en,False,,658835,State News - United States - Tennessee,http://www.tennessee.statenews.net/,"Country singer and guitarist Lindsay Ell spent her Saturday (May 30) at Nashville's protest following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis, Minn., at the hands of a white police officer. ""We have to start speaking up and teaching each other there is only one kind of love,"" Ell reflected on Instagram following the protest. ""Racism is a learned behavior and we are far too educated of a society to let this injustice continue to happen."" Below, Ell shares further thoughts about her decision to protest with her fellow Nashvillians and stand up against racism. It is easy to pretend to support something and then still not outwardly do anything about it. It is easy to think that we live in a world that has overcome racism and that we treat our brothers and sisters as equals. But sadly, that is not the case. It is hard is for me to even imagine what it’s like to be victim of negative profiling by authorities due to the color of my skin. The feeling it invokes honestly makes me sick. To the family of George Floyd, countless other families and the black community as a whole: My heart breaks for you. It is completely unacceptable that, as a society, we have let racism and discrimination continue to permeate our culture. It has plagued our world for far too long, and the responsibility falls to each of us to bring about change now. I attended the rally in downtown Nashville over the weekend. It was such a beautiful moment of people coming together to talk about love and stand up for one another. It was the perfect embodiment of ""being the change you wish to see in the world."" In order for permanent change to occur, a new education becomes our responsibility. We must change the way we think, change the way our teachers and our children think. Racism can no longer be an unknowingly learned behavior that is fed to our next generation. It must stop, and it won’t stop in an environment of silence. Justice is absolutely needed. Violence in any form cannot be acceptable. Hate does not defeat hate; only love can conquer hate. The true quality of a person is determined not only by their thoughts, but through their actions, and two wrongs never make a right. We need to be this change, not create more hate and destruction around it. Let’s march and walk hand in hand, together. Let’s demonstrate and stand up in non-violent, peaceful protests. Let’s donate. Let’s pour love into each other’s hearts. Let’s educate ourselves and each other. Let’s have conversations that make us uncomfortable. Let’s elevate the voices of black people to achieve the justice and equality that everyone deserves. We are not trying to start a fight -- we’re trying to end one. We will only accomplish this by coming together and demonstrating acts of love that reflect what’s in our hearts. And we keep doing that until there is no us vs. them, until it is just all of us, together. Let’s use our voices to instill change in the spirit of one love. We are all created equal. Every single one of us.",0.0

Long said the fact that the contact tracers actually got through to more than half of the new cases “shows that the system we’re setting up is working.” The city has hired 1,700 people for its contact tracing effort and needs to reach 2,500 in order to meet Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s target for entering the first phase of the state’s four-step reopening process. The contact tracers are placing people infected with the virus in hotel rooms if they need to isolate themselves away from their families as well as reaching out to the close contacts of those who test positive for COVID-19. Asked if the past week’s protests over the death of George Floyd might spark a new wave of infections, Long encouraged anyone who was at a protest to get tested for the coronavirus at one of the more than 150 free testing sites around the city. Floyd, who was black, died after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes. “It starts with the testing piece, which is why we’re extending the invitation we are to anybody that’s been out there at the protests, come in for a free test, it’s close to where you live,” Long said. “We’d love to have you.” Summer days camps in New York state can open June 29, though no decision has been made yet on sleep-away camps, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. Cuomo’s administration did not immediately provide details on what sort of restrictions camps would operate under. “Our young people have experienced both the trauma and the boredom of all these weeks of lockdown. They deserve to enjoy a safe summer filled with fun,” Assemblyman Simcha Eichenstein of Brooklyn said in a news release. The green light on summer camps comes as the state continues to relax restrictions amid slow progress in taming the outbreak. COVID-19 hospitalizations are down in New York, with an average of 154 admissions a day, compared to more than 3,000 daily at the peak of the outbreak. More than 24,000 deaths statewide have been reported in the outbreak, but the daily death toll has been under 60 for several days, with 58 new deaths recorded Monday. Buffalo and western New York on Tuesday became the latest region of the state allowed to reopen hair salons, retail shops and offices under strict guidelines. The Albany area was on track to also move to “phase two” reopenings on Wednesday.",0.0

For the second night under curfew, attendees largely dispersed at about the time the curfew took effect at 10 p.m. In contrast to previous nights, separate demonstrations popped up in areas beyond Downtown. A group of roughly 100 protesters, led by Darin Abston, briefly shut down part of Germantown Parkway near the Agricenter. Memphis Police confirmed both lanes had been closed but declined to say for how long. Abston said the road had shut down traffic for more than an hour before protesters started leaving around 9 p.m. Buy Photo Protesters walk between I Am A Man plaza and the Mason Temple in South Memphis, Tenn., during the seventh straight day of protests on Tuesday, June 2, 2020, in reaction to the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after being pinned down by a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day. (Photo: Joe Rondone/The Commercial Appeal) Like other activists in Memphis, Abston said he wants more de-escalation training for police and better community relations. At Poplar Avenue and Highland Street, as many as 20 young adults held up signs (""For George Floyd,"" ""Let Freedom Ring"") that earned approving honks from passing motorists. Abraham Nakayama, 19, said the Highland Street event was organized ""on the spur of the moment"" to reach people who likely wouldn't see the much-publicized Downtown protests. ""I've been marching the past four days, and you're pretty much reaching the same people,"" he said. These protesters did not enter the street to block traffic, and they waited until the nearby businesses had closed for the evening, so they could mobilize in the parking lot without discouraging shoppers. ""We don't want to interfere with people's lives, we want to impact people's lives,"" Nakayama said. Bethie Castellon, 21, said she hopes other groups pick up on these tactics, and create peaceful demonstrations at ""busy intersections"" all over the city. Downtown, Mandi Clayton marched hand in hand with her son Kavi, 8, throughout the night. “My son just needs to understand the climate of America and our history,” Clayton said. “I feel like it’s very important for him to understand what’s going on — and we’re making history right now.” Memphis has been a staple of the Civil Rights Movement, she said, making it a particularly meaningful place to march with her son. “This could be my son’s name that they’re screaming in the streets,” she said. “I could be a grieving mother or I could be Breonna. I could be dead as well. We just need to stand up and make a difference.” Buy Photo Protesters rally at the Mason Temple in South Memphis, Tenn., during the seventh straight day of protests on Tuesday, June 2, 2020, in reaction to the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after being pinned down by a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day.

(Photo: Joe Rondone/The Commercial Appeal) In the past week, two types of protests have emerged — those with Hill at the forefront, and those marked with standoffs between citizens and law enforcement. Hill has led a march every night since Thursday. Those marches have featured routes protected by Memphis police, who have largely stayed back while marches have snaked through Downtown streets. Outside of marches organized by Hill, more organic demonstrations have occurred — as well as arrests and police confrontations. The breakout protest occurring Sunday night yielded the largest number of arrests, 31 according to MPD, since demonstrations began a week ago.

(Photo: Ariel Cobbert/The Commercial Appeal) The first night of protests occurred on Wednesday, when peaceful demonstrators —masked and six feet apart — lined the north side of Union Avenue across from a Memphis Police Department precinct. Tensions escalated when two individuals who identified themselves as members of a pro-Confederate Facebook group, Confederate 901, showed up and held their own two-person ""All Lives Matter"" demonstration on the front lawn of the police precinct. The counter-protesters could be heard agitating the crowd, telling people to ""Go take a jog"" in a reference to Arbery's death. Arbery was chased and gunned down by two white men while jogging through a suburban neighborhood in coastal Georgia. Former City Council candidate and recent cancer survivor Theryn C. Bond, got into a heated verbal altercation with the counter-protesters. Nearly a week later, Bond, an activist, described why Hill's marches have been met with criticism by activists in Memphis. ""Many of the more well-known organizers in Memphis have a 'no-person left behind' policy. If you are in a big group, and something happens, we make sure you're okay. Did you get arrested? We'll organize bail. If you're hungry, you need water, you get sick during a demonstration...these are all things you have to consider when you're leading people."" Bond criticized Hill for not being present when protesters clashed with police on Saturday night, and then again Sunday night. The key to being a consistent leader, Bond said, is showing up consistently — and not just when cameras are rolling. Hill has defended the marches he has organized on social media, and in front of crowds, classifying his dissenters as, ""haters"" during Saturday's protest that started at the National Civil Rights Museum. Hill has also used social media to criticize use of force by law enforcement officers on Sunday evening. On Tuesday, like other nights of protest, several dozen protesters left Hill's group, forming their own march. The group split in two when Hill began to enter a predominantly black neighborhood that some in the crowd referred to as “the hood.” One group, led by LJ Abraham, headed back the same direction they came in, with Abraham saying there was no need to take their protest to neighborhoods that already understood their fight, and that doing so would only put the protesters at risk. Hill’s group continued through the neighborhood and to the historic Mason Temple before returning to the “I Am a Man Plaza.” Buy Photo Protesters down B.B.

The official Black Lives Matter chapter for Memphis has been collecting funds for those arrested. On Monday, local activist Keedran Franklin — one of the primary organizers who has worked alongside others on protests against police brutality, Confederate monuments, and low wages, announced on social media that enough funds had been gathered to pay for damages at Winfield's Shoes & Accessories. The shoe store was damaged during a protest on Saturday, when one individual broke the display window.

The Black Lives Matter assembly, which took place at noon in front of Walgreens across from Publix grocery store at the intersection of Main Street and Campbell Station Parkway, was described by event organizers as a “peaceful demonstration for George Floyd and those who unfairly lost their lives.” “We are here from love, we are here for peace, we are here to grow together,” said Tonia Andaluz, a mother and a nurse who calls Spring Hill her home. “We can make this country great, but we have to do it together.

Some would also be seen kneeling in protest, while others would lie on the ground with their hands clasped behind their backs, reenacting Floyd's last moments as Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin was recorded kneeling on his neck for several minutes.

Graham said he was proud of the way the event's organizers were able to work alongside the city to conduct an assembly that, above all, remained peaceful.

That's what's going on in Spring Hill, and we're ecstatic about it. It's going so well. It's a very young audience here, and I've gotten to talk to a lot of them,” Graham said. “This is just great. I think all of our city leaders recognize that this is about as American as you can get, and as long as it stays peaceful we're going to be very happy.” Lay added that the city is in full support of events like this, and that the community recognizes the importance of understanding its rights to assemble in a peaceful manner. “That's what we're hoping, because we want folks to be able to exercise their rights, voice opinions and whatever else,” Lay said. “We just want it to be done peacefully, and don't want things to turn ugly.

1623736468,2020-06-02 19:46:05,Journalist who lost eye in protests: Minorities face systemic violence in US,https://www.laprensalatina.com/journalist-who-lost-eye-in-protests-minorities-face-systemic-violence-in-us/,en,False,,287422,laprensalatina.com,http://laprensalatina.com/,"By Ana Milena Varon Los Angeles, Jun 2 (efe-epa).- A photojournalist, author and activist who was struck by a police-fired rubber bullet and lost her left eye last week while covering protests in Minneapolis following the death in police custody of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, said rioting is the only tool racial minorities have to combat the systemic violence and poverty they face. After returning to her home in Nashville, Tennessee, Linda Tirado said in an interview with Efe that the permanent damage she suffered is not the responsibility of one person in particular but rather of “a system that sees accountability as discretionary” and allows police to “fire into crowds and at journalists, driven by racism.” “You have to be blind to not see the racism. Three or four weeks ago … it was, you know, white militias (demanding an end to coronavirus-triggered lockdowns in Michigan) and nobody got tear-gassed. But if a black man gets killed and people protest that, then the National Guard gets called out. So I think it’s becoming very obvious,” she said. The freelance photographer said the US has been heading down a dark road for years but that President Donald Trump’s language has exacerbated the situation. “Trump’s rhetoric about some Mexicans not being good people and the press being the enemy of freedom and black people being thugs … you can’t listen to that for years and think that it’s not going to come to something like this,” Tirado said. The author and activist is best known for “Hand to Mouth: Living in Bootstrap America,” a 2014 non-fiction book that stems from an autobiographical essay she wrote the year before about her struggle to survive on a meager salary, a reality that she said affects millions in the US and Hispanics in particular. Six years after that book was published, the author said she is convinced the root cause of Floyd’s death (ruled a homicide by two autopsies) and subsequent violent protests and rioting are poverty and the lack of opportunities for a large number of Americans. “When was the last time you heard of police shooting somebody in a nice and wealthy section of town or stay on their neck for 10 minutes?” she said, referring to the actions by a white, since-fired police officer, Derek Chauvin, that led to Floyd’s death on May 25 in Minneapolis. (Chauvin has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, but protesters also are demanding that charges be brought against three other officers involved in that episode of police brutality) Referring to the nationwide looting and violence that has occurred in the wake of Floyd’s death, she said they are expressions of frustration by a community that has been ignored. Tirado took liquid antacid with her when she traveled to Minneapolis last Wednesday, planning to use it to wash out her tear-gassed eyes if necessary. She also was warned by demonstrators about potential police violence minutes before the first curfew went into effect in that midwestern city and the first rounds of tear gas were fired by law enforcement. But Tirado, named one of BBC’s 100 Women of 2014, still went out on the street wearing goggles and a face mask and ran in the direction of the tear gas, trying to capture the right image to reflect the seething tension. While focusing her camera, she felt the rubber bullet slam into her face. She didn’t see or hear it coming but only felt a sharp pain and then a burning sensation as the tear gas mixed with the blood leaking from her eye. Seeing her face bathed in blood, some demonstrators led her to the back of the crowd of demonstrators, lifted her onto a pickup truck and took her to a hospital. Tirado, who still has not sold her story to any media outlet, awoke from the anesthesia to the worst possible news: despite the efforts of surgeons and an hours-long operation, she is now permanently blind in her left eye. Asked if journalists are a target of police in the Floyd protests, she emphatically said, “yes.” “If you can get the press out of the way, then all you’ve got is complaints directly from protesters,” who easily can be dismissed as “agitators.” Tirado now is unsure what her future holds.",0.0

The peaceful protest is scheduled to begin at about 7 p.m. starting at the I Am A Man plaza. Protests in Memphis have remained largely peaceful, and organizers expect that to continue Tuesday night. Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland extended the city’s new curfew from 10 p.m. Tuesday to 6 a.m. Wednesday. There are exceptions for essential workers and for people with medical emergencies. Protesters in Memphis abided by that curfew Monday with no reported issues, and organizers are hopeful that will continue. People have marched in cities nationwide since the death of Floyd.

(WKRN) — Downtown businesses in Music City are making preparations as another protest is scheduled for Thursday afternoon. Many of the businesses on Broadway are closed and still boarded up following Saturday night’s riots, while others are making preparations for downtown to be get hit again. “We only plan on running one shift that day and we are going to close as early as we can just to make sure all my employees get home safe, make sure we stay safe as possible,” said Kris Mayfield the General Manager of Savannah’s Candy Kitchen in Nashville. Like many downtown businesses, the popular candy store will be closing up shop early yet again Thursday for the safety of their employees. “I don’t think we are planning on boarding up anything, I just think my boss and my owner really cares about our employees safety.” However, other establishments like John Rich’s Redneck Riviera will be boarding up their windows with plans to be closed for the day. While an employee at Legends Gift Shop told News 2 they will not be boarding up, saying they refuse to “give in.” “Unfortunately it’s just a bad, bad situation and a couple of bad apples,” said Mayfield. Thirty downtown businesses and buildings were damaged Saturday in Nashville by vandals, according to Metro police. The owner of Layla’s Honky Tonk told News 2 they plan to stay open until at least 7 p.m. as of right now, but expects there will be a curfew. She said the bar has only been open five days since COVID-19 and three of those days had a curfew, making it hard on the cities small business owners. “We love Nashville and hopefully everything is going to get back to as normal as we possibly can as soon as possible,” stated Mayfield. Most business owners tell News 2 they are waiting for guidance from Mayor Cooper as to how to handle Thursday. The protest meet-up is scheduled for 4 O’clock at Bicentennial Mall with a march to the Tennessee State Capitol. The protest is not officially organized by Black Lives Matter Nashville, but the organization says they will stand in solidarity with the black youth that plan to lead the action.

Major indexes wavered through the morning then turned solidly higher late in the day. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%. The gains came despite spreading unrest in the U.S. as investors hope that the gradual lifting of lockdown provisions will help economies recover from the damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Energy stocks far outpaced the rest of the market as the price of crude oil rose again. Bond yields rose, another sign that pessimism is ebbing. The modest gains had the S&P 500 on track for a three-day winning streak, extending the benchmark index’s remarkable two-month rally off a steep skid in February and March as broad swaths of the U.S. economy ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Wall Street’s momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, spurring threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. “The market action seems to have a lot more to do with people’s confidence about the economic reopening,” said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “It’s happening irrespective to what we’re seeing socially across the country right now.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 112 points, or 0.5%, to 25,590. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology companies, was flat after having been down 0.8% in the early going. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.9%. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early Tuesday to kick off trading on the Nasdaq. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. In Europe, France’s CAC 40 jumped 2% Tuesday as the country opened restaurants, cafes, parks and beaches and launched a contract tracing app to help keep tabs on new contagions. Germany’s DAX, which had been closed Monday, caught up with previous global markets’ gains and surged 3.7%. Britain’s FTSE 100 added 0.9%. Markets in Asia closed broadly higher. While more countries and sectors are reopening, economic activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. Meanwhile, investors continue to keep an eye out for any signs that the reopening of the economy is leading to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. Tokyo had 34 new confirmed cases Tuesday. The daily numbers had dropped below 20 recently. Even so, Wall Street is betting that the U.S. government and others will not move to close the economy again even if there is a pickup in new cases. “There’s just a lack of appetite for a potential re-shutdown in the event that the virus accelerates from here,” Hainlin said. Bond yields were mostly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.68% from 0.66% late Monday. Oil prices rose. Benchmark U.S. crude oil for July delivery was up 3.8% to $36.78 a barrel. Brent crude oil for August delivery rose 3.3% to $39.58 a barrel.",0.0

The crowds appeared to be significantly larger than on Monday, when federal law enforcement personnel resorted to tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades to clear peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square, next to the White House, so President Donald Trump could walk to a nearby church to be photographed holding the Bible. The demonstrators who came out Tuesday marched toward the White House, but found Lafayette Park surrounded by a fence 2.5m (8ft) high. Waiting beyond the fence were federal security agents in full riot gear. Around 100 people knelt on the street at an intersection near the Executive Mansion to chant “I can’t breathe,” the words uttered by George Floyd on the evening of May 25 as a white Minneapolis police officer held his knee to the 46-year-old black man’s neck. Floyd died at the scene. Denunciations of Trump as a racist and demands for his resignation were also heard. A day after the president’s unscheduled visit, St. John’s Church had its doors closed and its windows boarded up. Monday’s episode sparked widespread condemnation from politicians, religious leaders and the local administration in the District of Columbia. The bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, DC, Mariann Budde, upbraided Trump for using “one of our churches as a prop.” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and the chief of the metropolitan police said that municipal officers played no part in breaking up the protest on Monday. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that US Attorney General William Barr personally ordered federal forces to drive the protesters out of Lafayette Park. “I am mobilizing all available, federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting and looting to end the destruction and arson and to protect the rights of law-abiding Americans,” Trump said in the White House Rose Garden on Monday shortly before the attack on protesters. Floyd’s death has spurred protests – sometimes accompanied by looting and arson – in cities across the United States. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” Trump said Monday. US law allows domestic use of the Armed Forces in only a few cases and it is unclear whether any such order by Trump under the current circumstances would be legal. EFE afs-llb/dr",0.0

""Violence has no place and violence must be addressed,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told NPR's All Things Considered. ""But there is no reason for the U.S. military to be called out for this."" Pelosi was referring to a threat Trump made Monday evening in the Rose Garden at the White House. ""If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents,"" Trump declared in a brief statement, ""then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" As the president spoke, federal officers in riot gear near the White House launched tear gas and pepper spray at peaceful protesters. Shortly thereafter, Trump strode through a park cleared of the demonstrators to pose with a Bible in front of St. John's Church, leading a group of officials that included Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Walking like lapdogs behind a five-time draft dodging coward who is more interested in looking like a leader than actually being one,"" Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who lost both legs in combat as a military helicopter pilot in Iraq, said of Esper and Milley, ""sends a horrifying message to our troops — including our black and brown troops — that our military's leaders will not protect them from unlawful orders."" In a statement on Twitter, Duckworth added, ""We cannot allow any Commander in Chief to put our Armed Forces' reputation as the last institution Americans can trust and respect at risk by using them unlawfully and putting them in a position of exacerbating the divisions driving our union apart. ... Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not Presidential, it's tin-pot dictatorial."" But Trump does appear to have the power unilaterally to dispatch active-duty soldiers to trouble spots in the United States. The 1807 Insurrection Act authorizes a U.S. president to deploy military forces for domestic emergencies. The law was updated in 2006 to include natural disasters and terrorist attacks as grounds for sending federal troops to restore order. While condemning looting and vandalism that rocked Providence, R.I., on Monday evening, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, called Trump's threats to use military force against American citizens ""irresponsible and destablizing."" ""The job of bringing calm will take law enforcement and the community working together,"" Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. ""It will not come from recklessly invoking the Insurrection Act."" The Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee told reporters Tuesday he plans to convene an in-person congressional hearing next week to press the Pentagon's top two officials on Trump's possible invocation of the Insurrection Act. ""We need to hear from Chairman Milley and Secretary Esper as to exactly how they intend to use the U.S. military trying to deal with this domestic crisis,"" U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said on a video conference call. ""If the president is basically threatening to use the U.S. military to go in and enforce the law in U.S. cities, that runs the risk of an extreme escalation in violence and of a hugely disruptive practice."" Asked about Milley wearing camouflage fatigues in public Monday night, Smith said the nation's highest military officer may have misread the message being sent. ""The optics of him being in uniform out there might not have been so bad if we didn't have the president out there talking about going to war with the country and using the military and using overwhelming force,"" Smith said of Milley. In a conference call Monday, Trump told the nation's governors that Milley was ""a fighter, a war hero, a lot of victories and no losses and he hates to see the way it's being handled in the various states, and I just put him in charge."" Milley, whom Trump said was on the call, said nothing. But a senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that the Insurrection Act had not been invoked by Trump and insisted that Milley's role and authorities have not changed.

Floyd, 46, died May 25 after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for several minutes while Floyd was handcuffed on the ground. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. “The citizens of Columbia should know that the disturbing actions of officers seen last week in Minneapolis do not represent how the Columbia Police Department trains, responds to and interacts with our community,” Alsup said in a statement shared with The Daily Herald. The police chief, who was sworn into the position in late March with 23 years of experience in the local department, said the Columbia Police Department works to protect all and that he is extremely proud of his officers for upholding that standard. “The Columbia Police department sets the example when it comes down to displaying respect toward all of our citizens and understanding the basic truth that is ‘treat others as you would want to be treated,’ ” Alsup said. “It is very difficult to control what others do, but the two things you can always control is self-accountability and your humanity.” In Maury County, demonstrations have remained entirely peaceful with protestors and officers standing side-by-side offering protection rather than opposition on the steps of the Maury County Courthouse. Saturday, a group of demonstrators holding signs that read “I can’t breathe,” stood at the steps of the Maury County Courthouse joined by members of the local demonstrators, echoing the final words of both Floyd and Eric Garner in New York almost six years earlier. The courthouse is next to Columbia’s main police headquarters on the square. A day later, Columbia Vice Mayor Christa Martin called on members of the public to breathe in a poetic and poignant statement shared with the city. “I want you to breathe when you encourage great things for everyone — even if they are different from you,” Martin said. “I want you to breathe when you ask yourself, What can I do that is good and right for me and others?’ I want you to breathe when we look at the reality and call all wrong ‘wrong’ no matter whether it fits our biases and our-isms. “The systems that are in place that continue to squeeze the life out of us are wrong. The death and murder of George Floyd, and so many, many others, is wrong. Let’s everybody just call it that, and let’s just do something about it.” The vice mayor condemned the violence that has transpired in recent days. “Protest and speaking out for what you believe in is our right — looting and burning down buildings, cars, and other illegal action is wrong,” Martin said. “Black lives matter. All lives matter.” Maury County Mayor Andy Ogles praised the peaceful demonstration, and Columbia Mayor Chaz Molder commended the city’s police department stating that the local officers “should not be guilty by association.” “The riots across the country are not who we are as a community or a country,” Molder said on Monday. “They are not helpful, in fact destructive to the important problem that so many of us in my generation, and other generations, are ready to solve.” The mayor also joined in a sentiment shared by Serreta Boson during the recent courthouse demonstration who said that Columbia could become an example for the rest of the nation. “I think we have the right people in place right now to really make a change,” Boson said as she stood in a shadow cast by the Maury County Courthouse on Saturday morning. “This is an opportunity for Columbia to be on the map for change. This is a sleepy little town that has a lot of potential. This is about our way of life. The atmosphere is perfect for unity. It is perfect for a miracle and it could start right here in Columbia.” Molder’s statement followed praising the city for its ongoing turn to positivity amid a time of unrest seen in violent confrontations across the nation. “I can’t predict what the future holds for our country, or our community, but I am as confident as ever that Columbia can lead in a positive way that can be a model for the rest of the nation,” Molder said. “ I hear your concern, see your support, and feel your optimism. We will continue conversations in the days ahead and begin to form a plan so that when they look to Columbia, they’ll say we aren’t just talking about it, we are being about it. All of us are united towards a common goal. We will achieve it.” The city mayor said he will continue to navigate the through faith, the community at large and through its law enforcement system. Another demonstration is planned this coming Saturday. The Unity Rally will be held from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on the courthouse square in Columbia. “You have a voice and I believe in your right to be heard,” Alsup said. “I would also like to thank those wishing to conduct public displays, protests or gatherings who have reached out wanting to work together to peacefully share the message.” Alsup said he has spent recent days jumping from meeting to meeting with the government and committed leaders in an effort to maintain an ongoing conversation. “I would like to thank those community leaders, pastors and business owners who have taken the time to speak with me over the past few days allowing us to continue our open dialogue and continued relationships that we have worked so hard to establish and maintain for years,” Alsup said. A resident of Columbia since 1991, Alsup began his career with CPD in 1997 as a reserve officer. He was later hired on as a full time patrol officer the following year. Promoted to detective in 2006 and then becoming sergeant in the Criminal Investigation Division in 2009, he was named lieutenant in 2011, where he managed the Criminal Investigations Division. In 2013, he began leading the Patrol Division until his promotion to assistant chief in 2018. He was appointed to the seat just days after Molder issued a local state of emergency in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in southern Middle Tennessee. “I am well aware that I am assuming command in uncertain times,” Alsup said after being named chief of the department. “But one thing everyone can be certain of is the fact that the Columbia Police Department remains a constant that our community can rely on to respond and provide the highest quality police services to our citizens and visitors.”",0.0

Lindell Street. Throughout Saturday afternoon, social media posts claimed MPD Lt. John Cross made a threat of bodily harm against resident Adrian Oliver, who was apparently downtown during Saturday morning’s organized solidarity protest in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Pictures of Oliver and Cross were posted to Facebook and cell phone footage showed the officer accused of making threats and demands for Cross to turn on his body camera. Oliver viewed the body camera footage at the police department and later apologized on social media for the reported claims that went viral on Facebook. Oliver was apparently in a verbal exchange with a driver of a vehicle who stopped in the middle of S. Lindell Street in downtown Martin during the protest and during the traffic stop. Oliver requested to file a complaint against the driver who had reportedly engaged in the verbal exchange at the MPD Monday afternoon. He has reportedly received anonymous messages of death threats since the incident. This is the link to a copy of the MPD officer’s body camera footage from the traffic stop Saturday in its entirety.

But violence and looting do not honor Floyd’s memory, nor do they change anything. Apparently the way many show respect for George Floyd is to break a window of a Nike store and steal Air Jordans — not exactly what Dr. King would have done. I can offer some advice to all the “protesters” out there: Be sure not to forget to also steal AAA batteries for the flat-screen remote. Yet again, a northern police brutality case gave license to thugs to loot and riot. It starts when media intentionally mislabel them “protesters.” They are comfortable conflating “protester” with criminals who loot, riot and burn other businesses, some of them people’s life’s work. Media coverage has been predictably biased. CNN showed footage of teenagers looting an Amazon truck and reported that the “fearless protesters” were heroes, rescuing packages from being ruined by impending Molotov cocktail fires. Of the rioters, many were imported white liberal college anarchists, ANTIFA. The feds would not shoot them because they owe the government at least $90K each in student loans, and they wouldn’t let the students off the hook that easily. Almost all of these police brutality cases that have resulted in looting and rioting are in Northern cities controlled for years by wimpy Democrats: Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo; Freddie Gray in Baltimore; Cambridge, Mass., Professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates; Eric Garner in New York City and now George Floyd in Minneapolis. I do not remember the last Republican-led Southern city where police egregiously killed an unarmed black. As bad as the Floyd death was, it is neither a “crisis” nor systemic. According to FBI statistics, there are only about 900 police shootings a year: 42 percent are whites, blacks 32 percent and Hispanics 20 percent — about in line with crimes committed. Think about the “Ferguson effect” before you loot and riot: devastating, lingering economic and criminal impact on a town where crime goes unchecked by authorities out of fear. Democrats are all too willing to let the aggrieved continue to think they are always victims who should depend on the government. Strong, self-reliant people are not usually Democrats. The sad thing is, these “victims” do not realize that the very liberal Democrats in the cities mentioned earlier are the “leaders” who have done it to them. If they try to leave the Democrat Plantation and think for themselves, Joe Biden berates them with “You ain’t black.” This contrived “police war on black males” is a demonstrable lie. Even a black Harvard professor concluded there is no bias in police shootings. In her book “The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe,” Heather MacDonald cites simple FBI crime statistics that disprove the lie on which Black Lives Matter is based. She determines that a police officer is 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is likely to be killed by a cop. 6,000 blacks died of homicide last year; 93 percent were killed by another black person. Blacks commit homicide at a rate eight times higher than whites and Hispanics combined. Blacks are 13 percent of the population but commit 52 percent of all murders, putting them into more tense and regular contact with police. If you look for race in everything, then you will find it. Derek Chauvin was a bad cop who murdered. Period. No one disagrees with you. He will go to jail. There is no need to ruin peoples’ businesses in your neighborhood over this. Thugs have looted about all they can in “honor” of George Floyd. I was in an Atlanta store Tuesday where looters were outnumbered by folks determined to pay for stuff, because Dr. Fauci asked Democrat mayors to limit looters to six per store but only if they could not afford to loot from home. The good news is that it seems tear gas cures COVID. Folks in were unsure if it was still coronavirus season or looting season, not to pass judgment but to make sure they were dressed for the right season. —- A libertarian syndicated op-ed humorist, award-winning author and TV commentator, Ron Hart’s column appears Wednesdays in The Daily Herald.

""No white person wants to be black, but we are challenging you to get out of your comfort zone and break down a system that wasn’t built for black people.

Black history is American history,"" speaker Erica Gentry said. ""We have to teach them more than Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. We must empathize.

At deadline there were no reports of arrests. (Editor’s note: A City of Johnson City spokeswoman stated Wednesday that there were no arrests during Tuesday’s demonstration. Eleven arrests had been made the previous night.) Tuesday's protest was the largest of at least five to have taken place in Johnson City since the police killing of George Floyd. Monday’s protest began around 6 p.m. and lasted well into the early morning hours of Tuesday. That protest, which was largely peaceful, came to a head when demonstrators refused to leave the roadway — prompting officers in riot gear to make several arrests. “It’s exceptionally important (to show unity),” JCPD Captain Brian Rice said before he marched with demonstrators Tuesday. “What happened last night is not our city and it’s not our community and I’m not going to sit by and watch some people that are determined to wreck what we have here in Johnson City — I’m not going to sit by and let it happen.” Brock said Monday night’s protest “didn’t go as planned,” that she was “sad” to hear about what happened and “worried” about the demonstrators. As long as the protests remain peaceful and lawful, however, Brock said she will show her support. “These young people have said this is about a peaceful protest and I definitely want to come out and support that,” Brock said. “I just want to show my support, and just because of what happened last night — although we don’t want that to happen again — that doesn’t break anything and we’re going to move forward.” For the protesters, emotions were mixed about Monday’s demonstration. Alyjah Gilmer, one of the protest leaders, said Monday night was “craziness” and that he “hopes it doesn’t turn out like that again.” Joseph Varghefe said he didn’t feel they did anything wrong, and that they’re “here to be heard,” but will not support any violence. “They may feel like we broke the law, but these police officers across the country break the law of murdering a man in the streets, so we will go to the streets peacefully and show our message,” Varghefe said, calling last night “an amazing demonstration. “America expects me, as a Southern Asian, to be the model immigrant and not speak out, but I will speak my mind,” he continued. “And I stand behind these people and I will take to the front lines if I need to, and let them beat me to death if they need to because I will not see another black brother or sister getting beaten in the street for their color.” Either way, having city leaders march with them was a sign that the protesters’ message is being received. “I know they hear us for sure now,” Gilmer said. “Listening, I’m still about 50/50 on … hopefully, this is the start of them listening and there more to come for sure.” Taquan Hankins, another of the protest organizers, said Tuesday’s march was “wonderful” and that he “definitely” feels the city has heard them. Brock said they’ve “absolutely” received the message. “They don’t need to get our attention anymore, at all,” Brock said. “We’ve heard this, but it’s important for them to be heard.”",0.0

Thousands of people gathered in the afternoon in central Washington DC as protesters also flooded the streets of New York, Los Angeles and Houston on the eighth day of protests over the killing of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer last week. Protesters on the front line of the protest in Washington DC chanted and shouted in front of security forces deployed on the other side of a chain-link fence about 2.5 meters (8 feet) high, installed Tuesday morning along the northern edge of Lafayette Square, next to the White House. The new fence prevented protesters from approaching the White House and occupying Lafayette Park, which on Monday was the scene of chaos as security forces dispersed protesters so that Trump could walk across the square and pose for a photo in front of a church. The event sparked harsh criticism of the president from religious leaders, Democratic politicians, and at least one Republican senator, Ben Sasse, although the conservative majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, blocked a resolution promoted by the progressive opposition to condemn Trump. The controversy grew when various media outlets revealed that it was US Attorney General William Barr who gave the order to federal security agents to extend the perimeter around the White House when hundreds of people were participating in a peaceful protest. That allowed Trump to walk to the historic Saint John’s Episcopal Church, located at the other end of the park and the scene of a small fire that caused no damage on Sunday, to pose before cameras with a Bible in his hand, a gesture that many saw as little more than a wink to his voters. The acting head of the US Park Police, Gregory Monahan, denied in a statement on Tuesday that his agents and “other assisting law enforcement partners” had used tear gas to disperse the protesters, as indicated by numerous witnesses and journalists in the area. Monahan said that what the police used were “smoke canisters and pepper balls,” and assured that they did it to respond to the “bricks, frozen water bottles and caustic liquids” thrown at the authorities. The event seemed to inject momentum into the protesters, who, after they were unable to approach the White House, flooded to the historic Lincoln Memorial, where the reverend Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous speech “I have a dream.” Sitting at the foot of the steps leading to the monument, the protesters remained silent and then, nearing the beginning of the 7 pm (23:00 GMT) curfew, they pronounced a prayer looking at dozens of National Guard members who watched them from the top of the stairs. Attorney general Barr warned that the presence of federal agents would be further strengthened on Tuesday, although he did not refer to Trump’s threat to put “thousands and thousands” of military personnel onto the streets of Washington. The Pentagon has deployed active military police and combat engineers near the capital in case it is necessary to send them into the protests, according to official sources quoted by various media. Large crowds were also seen in Los Angeles, Boston, Houston and New York, where the first curfew in the Big Apple in almost 80 years was brought forward to 8 pm (24:00 GMT) after the majority of the violence began just after dark on Monday.

(WATE) — A peaceful protest in Oak Ridge happened Tuesday evening in response to the national protests and marches occurring after the death of George Floyd in Minnesota while in police custody. Oak Ridge’s police chief, along with several officers, marched alongside community members, who were calling for change. “Today what this event is about is bringing our community together. Everybody in agreeance, everybody standing together for something that we all agree with,” organizer Trevor King said. The peaceful protest kicked off at Oak Ridge High School, organized by the 2013 graduate. His message is short, but strong. “Make racism illegal,” King said. On Tuesday evening, a growing crowd gathered in the parking lot. They then marched across the street, chanting “no justice, no peace.” Oak Ridge’s police chief and other officers walked with them. “It’s not us against the community. We want the same thing they do. We want our people to be safe, we want them to be secure. We want them to feel like they can trust us and we can trust them back,” ORPD Chief Robin Smith said. The group then came together at the city’s Peace Bell. The organizer was adamant about the event remaining peaceful. “At this time right now in America, after the looting, the rioting for seven days straight, it’s time to extinguish those fires. We got the attention that we need, we have their attention, now stop acting a fool. Stop doing all the extra stuff and hold people accountable,” King said. Those showing up telling us why they did. “It’s wrong, we need change,” said Jacob Cagle. “If there’s no justice for you, there’s no peace for me,” said Danielle Humphrey. “I want everybody to fight for a purpose, even if it doesn’t seem like it has anything to do with you, and I want everyone to be loved.” Speakers wrapping up the peaceful protest by calling up the city’s police officers and praying. “We love you, we celebrate you, and we trust you and we thank you,” one speaker said to the ORPD officers. Then, they posed a question to the crowd. “Are you serious when you say that you really want to see change, and my question is are you willing to make a sacrifice,” he asked.

Protesters on the front line of the protests in Washington DC chanted and shouted in front of security forces deployed on the other side of a chain-link fence about 2.5 meters (8 feet) high, installed Tuesday morning along the northern edge of Lafayette Square, next to the White House. The new fence prevented protesters from approaching the White House and occupying Lafayette Park, which on Monday was the scene of chaos as security forces dispersed protesters so that Trump could walk across the square and pose for a photo in front of a church. The event sparked harsh criticism of the president from religious leaders, Democratic politicians, and at least one Republican senator, Ben Sasse, although the conservative majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, blocked a resolution promoted by the progressive opposition to condemn Trump. The controversy grew when various media outlets revealed that it was US Attorney General William Barr who gave the order to federal security agents to extend the perimeter around the White House when hundreds of people were participating in a peaceful protest. That allowed Trump to walk to the historic Saint John’s Episcopal Church, located at the other end of the park and the scene of a small fire that caused no damage on Sunday, to pose before cameras with a Bible in his hand, a gesture that many saw as little more than a wink to his voters. The acting head of the US Park Police, Gregory Monahan, denied in a statement on Tuesday that his agents and “other assisting law enforcement partners” had used tear gas to disperse the protesters, as indicated by numerous witnesses and journalists in the area. Monahan said that what the police used were “smoke canisters and pepper balls,” and assured that they did it to respond to the “bricks, frozen water bottles and caustic liquids” thrown at the authorities. The event seemed to inject momentum into the protesters, who, after they were unable to approach the White House, flooded to the historic Lincoln Memorial, where the reverend Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous speech “I have a dream.” Sitting at the foot of the steps leading to the monument, the protesters remained silent and then, nearing the beginning of the 7 pm (23:00 GMT) curfew, they pronounced a prayer looking at dozens of National Guard members who watched them from the top of the stairs. Attorney general Barr warned that the presence of federal agents would be further strengthened on Tuesday, although he did not refer to Trump’s threat to put “thousands and thousands” of military personnel onto the streets of Washington. The Pentagon has deployed active military police and combat engineers near the capital in case it is necessary to send them into the protests, according to official sources quoted by various media. In New York City, as the sun rose and day one of the first curfew in the last 80 years came to an end, the magnitude of damage caused by protesters on the iconic Fifth Avenue came to light. The window displays of the street, a symbol of the opulence and power of the Big Apple, could be seen boarded up to prevent looting which have followed peaceful protests. A few hours before the second curfew was to be enforced, central New York appeared as if the coronavirus epidemic had claimed it once again, with few vehicles or people on the streets. The first day of the curfew saw the detention of more than 700 people in New York, the highest number since the beginning of the protests triggered by Floyd’s death in Minnesota.",0.0

Story Highlights Lloyd Kramer is a professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and the author of ""Nationalism in Europe & America: Politics, Cultures, and Identities Since 1775."" The Billy Graham Crusade at Neyland Stadium in May 1970 was a major transitional event in my life because I was arrested there for “disrupting a religious service” and shouting “public obscenities.” After 50 eventful years, it still influences how I understand my personal history as well as the history of modern America. I was a 20-year-old student at Maryville College in that tumultuous month when President Richard Nixon ordered the American invasion of Cambodia, National Guardsmen killed four anti-war protesters at Kent State University and demonstrations erupted across the country. The announcement that Nixon would attend Billy Graham’s Crusade at the University of Tennessee attracted attention because it would be the president’s first campus visit since the Cambodian invasion, and I quickly decided with some friends that we should attend the crusade to protest the war in Vietnam and Cambodia. I came from a family with deep roots in East Tennessee. My maternal grandfather was a Presbyterian minister who had long served as president of Maryville College. My paternal grandfather was a prominent attorney who had founded a well-known Knoxville law firm. My parents both grew up in Maryville, and I was born there, too. Although I later lived in Arkansas and Indiana, Blount County was the family homeland to which I returned for a college education. War protesters at the crusade My youthful identity was therefore shaped by strong family values, religious traditions, deep beliefs in America’s democratic political system and vague ambitions that I might one day become a candidate for legislative office. By 1970, however, I also believed that the Vietnam War was an immoral foreign intervention and a dangerous threat to America’s national well-being. So I joined the anti-war protest at the Billy Graham Crusade on May 28, sitting quietly amid a small group whose signs quoted the biblical commandment “Thou Shall Not Kill.” Buy Photo Organizers and officials pose for a photo with Rev. Billy Graham, in dark suit at center, at the Knoxville crusade at Neyland Stadium. (Photo: News Sentinel archives) Although we were vastly outnumbered by the crowd that came to see Nixon and Graham, a few rowdy protesters shouted obscenities when the president was described as a peacemaker and when Nixon himself praised the “great silent majority” for their support. I stayed with my friends for the whole service, but as we left our seats two plainclothes policemen grabbed my long-haired college roommate and me, charging that we had disrupted the crusade by shouting obscenities. I immediately denied that we had shouted at anyone, whereupon the police took us to the Knoxville jail. Your state. Your stories. Support more reporting like this.

Arrested but privileged As a privileged young white man, I had not learned what young black men already know well by age 20: People can be promptly arrested for looking like “the wrong kind of person” or for standing in “the wrong place.” The advantages of a privileged family life nevertheless soon reappeared when my lawyer-uncle bailed me out of jail and when my college president arranged for my roommate and me to meet with Graham in his trailer before the final crusade service on Memorial Day.

Bill Brock III, Nixon, and first lady Pat Nixon. (News Sentinel Archive) (Photo: KNS Archive) I still have clear memories of that conversation because I naively assumed that if we told Graham about the injustice of our arrests and explained how Nixon had “used” the crusade for his own political purposes, he would see the truth and urge dismissal of our pending charges. Graham, of course, did not accept our interpretation of either the arrests or Nixon’s visit. He kindly noted instead that he had befriended every recent president, and Nixon’s Knoxville stopover was simply another example of a good friendship. We were then ushered from Graham’s trailer into the final crusade service, which dramatically combined a passionate sermon with Memorial Day patriotism and an expansive display of flapping American flags.

(Photo: Dan Sears, UNC-Chapel Hill) Fortunately, the charges against my roommate and me were eventually dropped (with the help of good lawyers), and I went on to complete a graduate degree in history. A career in law and politics seemed less appealing or available after 1970, but historical studies provided empowering knowledge that helped me understand how our personal lives intersect with unexpected public upheavals that alter our plans and change our identities. Looking back over these past 50 years, I can now see more clearly how Graham’s Knoxville crusade exemplified major historical trends that still shape American society in 2020.

(KNS Archive) (Photo: News Sentinel) Nationalism and religion First, the crusade presented a beautifully staged fusion of nationalism and religion, thereby generating an emotional linkage that has retained its power from the age of Nixon to the age of Donald Trump. Nationalist rituals and symbols always take on quasi-religious meanings, but nationalism becomes even more persuasive when it merges with the messages and leaders at religious celebrations such as Graham’s crusades.

(NEWS SENTINEL ARCHIVE) (Photo: KNS Archive) Fear of 'the other' Second, the rage against anti-war protesters in May 1970 expressed an angry “fear of the other” that continues to shape our cultural and political life. I remember the surrounding hostility as the police led me out of Neyland Stadium, and I’ve never forgotten how state leaders condemned the protesters as people who hated America. Despite my East Tennessee roots, I experienced the frightening dehumanization that unpopular “outsiders” face constantly in their daily lives.

It was Nixon's first appearance at a college campus since the Kent State shootings earlier in the month. (University of Tennessee Libraries) (Photo: University of Tennessee Libraries) Identity politics Finally, the Billy Graham Crusade became a 20th-century prelude for the “identity politics” that now dominate American culture and politics. People conveyed their personal identities and political values through their clothing, hairstyles, flags and peace signs. The tribal identities that collided in Neyland Stadium asserted opposing conceptions of self-hood that have intensified all of America’s later political debates. The events of that long-ago Billy Graham Crusade therefore remind me that our personal choices must always be made in historical contexts that we cannot control and that our personal lives always bring us to unexpected places and experiences. More generally, the enduring legacies of the crusade still demand attention, even from those who were not there and especially from those who want to understand the nationalist religion, political scapegoating and polarizing cultural identities that permeate modern American society.

1624129867,2020-06-02 17:00:30,Black female mayors in spotlight amid protests and pandemic,https://tri-statedefender.com/black-female-mayors-in-spotlight-amid-protests-and-pandemic/06/02/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=black-female-mayors-in-spotlight-amid-protests-and-pandemic,en,False,,284383,Welcome to The Tri-State Defender,http://tsdmemphis.com/,"by Kat Stafford — Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms captured the nation’s attention when she addressed the civil unrest occurring in her city after George Floyd’s death. “I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old,” Bottoms said Friday in a rousing speech. “When I saw the murder of George Floyd, I hurt like a mother.” Bottoms and other black female mayors, including Lori Lightfoot of Chicago, are leading some of the nation’s largest cities during an unprecedented moment of challenge as protests against police brutality overlap with the coronavirus pandemic and an economic collapse. They’re being praised as thoughtful leaders at a time of political tumult and high-profile examples of black women seeking and winning political office across the country. Higher Heights for America PAC, a political action committee dedicated to electing more progressive black women, said there are seven black women serving as mayors in the nation’s 100 most populous U.S. cities, compared to just one in 2014. “Black women have always been leading and we have been the defenders of our homes, our communities and our nation,” said Glynda Carr, the president and CEO of Higher Heights. “Our leadership was built for this moment and their unique experiences as black women, not only as Americans, has provided the type of trusted leadership that can help move this country forward.” The mayors have demonstrated leadership with personal connections. Lightfoot, Chicago’s first black female mayor and first openly gay leader, frankly acknowledged America’s dark history of racism and blasted President Donald Trump’s divisive tweets in which he called protesters “thugs” and said “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” “It’s impossible for me as a black woman who has been the target of blatant racism over the course of my life not to take the killing of George Floyd personally,” Lightfoot said. “Being black in America should not be a death sentence.” The question is whether this moment will translate into a long-lasting higher profile for the mayors. Bottoms, for example, was already believed to be under consideration as Joe Biden’s running mate before the protests. Her stature has only risen amid the unrest. Beyond her well-received remarks Friday, she acted swiftly two days later, firing two police officers and placing three others on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest arrest involving two college students. “Use of excessive force is never acceptable,” Bottoms told reporters. Nadia Brown, a political science professor at Purdue University, said her research has found that many black female leaders, especially within their own communities, are seen as relatable figures — something that has worked in their favor at this time. During the pandemic, residents made viral memes of Lightfoot enforcing her stay-at-home orders. Instead of chiding them, Lightfoot embraced the moment and used it to connect with residents, Brown said. “I think that we’re seeing some of this play out in real time,” Brown said. “She was speaking in that role of telling residents what to do from an authority figure that seemed very familiar. And I think that’s kind of a mode in which we’re seeing some other black women elected officials deal with unrest in that they’re speaking to constituents not just as an authority figure but one that is familiar.” Rochester, New York, Mayor Lovely Warren, who is in her second term as the first black female mayor of the state’s third-largest city, said that while black women have made strides in gaining prominence, they still face unique challenges of racism and stereotypes. “We’re trying to fight a system that was institutionally built to create the disparities that it has created over generations and so we’re trying to undo the damage that has been done to prepare our children for the future,” Warren said. “A lot of times we get branded with the ‘angry black woman syndrome’ when we’re speaking up to a number of different issues that impact our community, but we have been built to take on the responsibility and we take it in stride.” “No matter which mayor I look at across this country right now, they have done an extraordinary job trying to balance all that’s coming toward them,” Warren added. Other black mayors including San Francisco’s London Breed and Muriel Bowser of Washington have also been recognized for their measured responses and handling of their communities. A’shanti Gholar, president of Emerge America, an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office, said many of the black women in office today were entrenched in grassroots political work for decades, paving the way for those to come behind them. “This is about a movement, a movement of women extending and taking their leadership all over across the country,” Gholar said. “Black women running for office and winning, it isn’t an anomaly. They’re also building up the next generation of black women elected officials and black women mayors who they’re inspiring to run.” Although gains have been made, Carr said there’s still much more work to be done. Biden has pledged to pick a woman as a running mate and is considering several women of color. No black woman has ever served as governor in the country. Carr noted that black women make up 7.6% of the country’s population yet account for just 4.3% of all members of the House and 1% of the Senate. “All that we celebrate about the gains we made 51 years after Shirley Chisholm became the first black woman to serve in Congress, we also recognize that the 23 million black women in this country are so underrepresented and underserved,” Carr said. “So, we need to continue to invest in recruiting, training and supporting black woman.” ___ Kat Stafford is a member of the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

Rosenstein told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he relied on lower-level investigators and attorneys to do the right thing in preparing applications for the secret court that authorizes surveillance on Americans. Now, he said, he recognizes via the subsequent investigations that those officials did not do the right thing — and accordingly, Rosenstein said he wouldn't have signed the application. The former deputy attorney general defended the overall need for an investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election and said he stood by its findings and much of its work. But he also acknowledged that it has since become clear he and other Justice Department leaders were acting upon incomplete information. In the case of former Trump aide Carter Page, Rosenstein said he remembered an application for renewal, one that that had been submitted before, and one that he then believed made a cogent case to continue the surveillance. ""My recollection of it was that it was actually fairly persuasive,"" he said. GOP vows more investigation of Russia investigation Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went ahead with a session Wednesday scheduled before the flare in protests and violence that followed the death of a Minneapolis man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in an incident that reignited long-simmering anger at police in cities across the country. The political context has evolved; Republicans want to tie former Vice President Joe Biden into what they call the abuses of power from the end of the Obama era. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said what he called the ""Obama-Biden administration"" had done ""went right up to the very top"" and was worse than the abuses of President Richard Nixon. Cruz also called Rosenstein ""grossly negligent."" He and Republicans sought answers about what Rosenstein and other Justice Department leaders knew at the time they were making fateful decisions about the FBI's investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which sought to hinder Hillary Clinton and help elect then-candidate Donald Trump. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., rejected Cruz's comparison between Obama and Nixon and said it would ""never stand the test of time."" She also said Graham was wasting everyone's time now. ""I have made it very clear that I think that it is absurd we are having this hearing."" Strange days Rosenstein found himself in the center of a political vortex in the spring of 2017, not long after he'd been nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. His boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was a Trump loyalist and had recused himself from the Russian matter. The president had fired FBI Director James Comey. In the midst of that febrile atmosphere, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as a special counsel and continue the Russia investigation. ""I was concerned the public would not have confidence in the investigation and that the acting FBI director [at the time] was not the right person to lead it,"" Rosenstein told senators on Wednesday. ""I decided appointment of special counsel was the best way to complete the investigation and promote public confidence in the conclusions."" Re-look after re-look has verified Mueller's findings about the Russian interference, but the work of the FBI and Justice Department wasn't found to be problem-free. Issues with the FBI investigators involved and their dealings within officialdom, especially with the secret court that oversees government surveillance, have embarrassed the top levels of federal law enforcement. Longtime target Many Republicans have faulted Rosenstein since his earliest days over his appointment of Mueller. Now, Graham brought Rosenstein back into center stage at a time when Trump and other allies want to link Biden with intelligence collection that involved members of the Trump camp. Graham said he also intends to conduct more interviews and hearings about the investigation, including with planned subpoenas. One future witness could include the former deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, Graham said. ""We're going to get to the bottom of it ... this stinks,"" Graham said. ""This is a sad episode on the history of the FBI."" Biden's camp has rejected the idea there were any abuses and pointed out that there was no way for administration officials to single out Americans in intelligence reporting because their names were hidden, or masked. They were only identified after requests for more information about who was talking with existing targets, Biden's campaign said. That practice is legal and takes place thousands of times per year. Trump and allies have made it the basis of political attacks against Biden and others from that era, as Cruz repeated at Wednesday's hearing. Biden, in turn, has blasted Trump and Republicans for what he calls their attempt to distract attention from the most pressing challenges of the day — first the coronavirus pandemic and now the national unrest over police violence. ""Sen. Graham sold his conscience in exchange for a better shot at winning his primary,"" a spokesman for Biden's campaign said Democrats, who are in the minority on the Senate Judiciary Committee, took up that theme on Wednesday, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. She also restated that the findings and much of the work of the Mueller era have been validated. Feinstein emphasized with Rosenstein that the infamous, never-verified Russia dossier was not used as the basis to charge anyone. And Rosenstein underlined what he called the important need to conduct investigations that might not necessarily lead to charges — and that in the case of the Mueller era, no Americans ultimately were charged with conspiring with the Russians who attacked the election. Republicans argue the mere fact of a continued investigation into Page — after evidence surfaced they argue should have quashed it — is improper even though Page was never charged. In Rosenstein's case, he signed a request to continue surveillance on Page based on work product that has since been repudiated by internal investigators and the secret surveillance court. Those details didn't become clear to the public — or Rosenstein, he said on Wednesday — until later. Graham said he accepts that explanation but wants to know why information being gleaned by lower-level investigators wasn't making its way to the leadership of the FBI or Justice. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., tried to emphasize with Rosenstein that although the Page surveillance application process was flawed, none of the other surveillance conducted in the Russia investigation suffered from the same problems. The Page problems don't invalidate the rest of the Mueller work, Leahy argued. Other Democrats complained about the use of the time and energy of the Judiciary Committee to execute what Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, R-R.I., called a political errand for Trump. Graham defended what he called the need to excavate the decisions in the Russia investigation and, meanwhile, has sought to show the Judiciary Committee can keep many plates spinning at once. The committee heard from witnesses on Tuesday about the deadly effects of the coronavirus within the federal prison system and Graham also has planned a hearing later this month about race and policing following Floyd's death.

The hearing is scheduled to commence at 10 a.m. ET. Watch it live here.

Republicans are likely to press Rosenstein over what they call surveillance abuses and the subsequent findings by investigators about problems with the FBI's practices at crucial junctures in the saga. Rosenstein now is with the law firm King & Spalding but he has appeared before congressional inquisitors before. In the past, Rosenstein has said that he relied on lower-level investigators and attorneys and wasn't involved with the operational details now known to be problematic. Specifically, Rosenstein signed a request to continue surveillance on a former junior campaign aide to Trump, Carter Page, based on work product that has since been repudiated by internal investigators and the secret surveillance court. Those details didn't become clear to the public until later. That likely will be a major area of focus on Wednesday, along with other episodes that have since come to light from the early weeks of the Trump administration.

Story Highlights William Cooper is an attorney who has written for The Tennessean, Wall Street Journal, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun and USA TODAY. U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander’s vote against hearing witnesses was a pivotal moment in President Donald Trump’s Senate impeachment trial. Alexander’s decision brought an abrupt end to the proceedings, resulting in Trump’s acquittal just a few days later. The Senate trial was another episode in Trump’s long and complicated relationship with the rule of law. He has spent his adult life chasing real estate deals, television cameras and, more recently, swing voters. He has not been sitting in a law library pondering the nuances of America's constitutional order. U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander talks to reporters as he walks past the Senate chamber before the start of the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 31, 2020. (Photo: Steve Helber/AP) Rule of law? When it comes to the rule of law, he simply does not know the rules. Take his recent assertion that his “authority” over state governments to address the coronavirus pandemic “is total.” This, of course, turns the most basic rule of federalism – that states have central authority over their citizens’ health and safety – on its head. Trump is like a batter who hits the ball and then runs to third base – only as president he's batting clean-up and this is Game Seven of the World Series. William Cooper (Photo: Submitted) That's not to say he's unfamiliar with the legal system. To the contrary, his companies have been the subject of extensive litigation; he has been divorced twice; and he has gone bankrupt numerous times. When it comes to how the executive branch fits into the rest of our constitutional system, however, Trump was essentially starting from scratch the day he was inaugurated. And it showed. One of his first acts as president was to issue the poorly drafted, blatantly unconstitutional Executive Order 13769 (the “travel ban”), seeking to prevent millions of Muslims from entering the country. After widespread public outrage and internal protest at the Department of Justice – culminating in Trump firing Acting Attorney General Sally Yates – Trump abruptly replaced the travel ban with a revised version.

Never-ending legal troubles It was downhill from there. The Trump team has since been mired in one legal trouble after another, including the Mueller investigation, numerous indictments, the convictions of Trump's personal lawyer (Michael Cohen), campaign chairman (Paul Manafort) and longtime political advisor (Roger Stone) – to name a few – and ultimately Trump's own impeachment. Trump has, moreover, cast aside basic norms governing presidential communications about legal matters. For example, he has used Twitter to belittle his own attorney general, weigh in on ongoing federal court cases, make baseless accusations of criminal behavior, advocate for prosecutions of his political rivals, criticize the DOJ's line prosecutors and intimidate witnesses in active matters. Hear more Tennessee voices: Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought-provoking columns. This bellicosity has given rise to the narrative that Trump is not just lawless, but a dictator who has hijacked our constitutional system. As Rep. Jerry Nadler put it, ”he is a dictator” and “only his will goes.” According to Kurt Bardella, a USA TODAY Opinion columnist, Trump has turned “the presidency into a dictatorship” and “stripped away the levers of independent oversight until there's nothing left.” Even Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman recently warned that “authoritarian rule may be just around the corner.” Police used tear gas to clear protesters from a park before President Trump walked over to St. John's Episcopal Church. (Photo: Getty) Trump isn't competent enough to be a dictator While rooted in legitimate concern, this narrative is confused. Trump is no dictator. For a president to seize power in our zero-sum constitutional system he must outwit those who currently have it – namely, the other two branches of the federal government and the states. The opposite occurs with Trump: Federal judges repeatedly rule against him; John McCain destroyed his health care ambitions; Nancy Pelosi blocked his legislative agenda; Adam Schiff had him impeached. Even Trump's own executive branch subjected him to the multi-year Mueller investigation. President Donald Trump listens during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House, Friday, March 20, 2020, in Washington. (Photo: Evan Vucci, Associated Press) State and local governments likewise do not bend to Trump's will. He quickly rescinded his claim of total authority over the states regarding the coronavirus – after strong public push-back from numerous governors – and retreated back to offering states advisory guidelines. Even local mayors routinely defy his executive orders regarding sanctuary cities. These things don’t happen to dictators. Real dictators consolidate power and effectively craft and utilize the rule of law to advance considered aims. In striking contrast, Trump's clumsy initiatives get stymied by virtually every instrument of his own government – time and again. No, Donald Trump is not a real dictator transforming our government to his advantage. He is a real estate developer who – while the world watches – fails to understand how it works.

""We must stand in solidarity with one another. We must continue to work with compassion until justice is served. And we must commit to eradicate racism in all its forms,"" the Rev. Ronnie Floyd, president of the convention's executive committee, said. His call for Southern Baptists to do more came in response to the recent killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee to his neck for more than eight minutes. His death has spurred peaceful protests against police brutality as well as unrest across the U.S. The Rev. Ronnie Floyd, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Executive Committee, is pictured in this 2015 file photo. (Photo: Eric Albrecht / AP) Ronnie Floyd, who is not related to George Floyd, delivered his message at the start of SBC Advance, an online event held Tuesday. The aim of SBC Advance was to give Southern Baptists an update on the denomination's ministries since their annual meeting, slated to be held next week in Orlando, Florida, was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""George Floyd died in a cruel, demeaning and needless way,"" Ronnie Floyd said. ""This has poured fuel upon a nation that is already angry about many things."" Ronnie Floyd asked Southern Baptists to pray for the violence to end. He expressed gratitude to law enforcement for protecting communities, but lamented the misuse of authority that ends up harming others. Southern Baptists stand and mourn with African-American pastors and churches in the U.S., he said. Racism is a sin, Floyd said, and Jesus is the only answer to the problem. The Baptist Faith and Message speaks against racism. In recent decades, Southern Baptists have grappled with their own pro-slavery roots, working on racial reconciliation and increasing diversity among leadership. Although the first attempt failed, Southern Baptists disavowed white supremacy in 2017. The following year the executive committee, which acts on behalf of the Southern Baptist Convention when it is not in session, expelled a Georgia church on charges of racism. ""Until we repent and change the way we are looking at one another, talking to one another, and treating one another, spiritual revival and awakening will not come,"" Floyd said. ""Without relationships and conversations, we will never understand one another."" Floyd spent the rest of Tuesday's SBC Advance guiding those watching online through a series of video updates given by the leaders of Southern Baptist seminaries, LifeWay Christian Resources, missionary organizations and more. The challenges created by the COVID-19 outbreak were brought up in many of the presentations. Like other churches, Southern Baptist entities have had to figure out how to adapt their work during stay home orders and social distancing guidelines. ""We don't know what the next year holds. We don't know when everything is going to be over, but what we know is the God who has sustained us ... he is going to be with us and we can look to him for the mercies we need to thrive, not just survive, but thrive in these days to come,"" the Rev. J.D. Greear, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention, said in a video message. Greear will serve a third, one-year term as president because of the canceled meeting. He plans to deliver a presidential address next week and broadcast it online. Denomination continue to grapple with response to sexual abuse Southern Baptist life can continue to function even though the annual meeting was canceled, but the skipped gathering does slow down some of the official business of the network of evangelical churches. Most notably, it delays the second and final vote on constitutional changes aimed at making it clear that Southern Baptist churches must address discrimination and sexual abuse. Like other religious traditions and segments of society, Southern Baptists have been grappling with their own sexual abuse crisis. It has been a major focus of recent annual meetings and drawn protests. Critics say Southern Baptists have responded too slowly and are not doing enough to address the problems. Sexual abuse survivors and victim advocates have participated in the For Such A Time As This Rally outside the annual meeting for the past two years. On Tuesday, they moved the demonstration online due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The Rev. Ashley Easter, one of the organizers of the rally, does not think the Southern Baptist Convention has made substantive changes. She spoke Tuesday via a video post. ""The Southern Baptist Convention needs to stand up and do what is right,"" Easter said in a Tuesday Facebook post. ""So we call again for a database, we call again for the respect of women in the Southern Baptist Convention and we call again for a truly qualified curriculum to be mandated for all pastors and church leaders and seminary students."" The Southern Baptist Convention is the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. Its 2021 annual meeting will be held June 15 to 16 in Nashville, where the convention is headquartered.

It didn’t take long to figure out that her sadness came from the recent news events where our country suffered another racial wound. But apart from her progressive political anger was a deep fear for the life and safety of myself and other members of my family. My wife is white and I’m African-American. She watched the video of Christian Cooper, a birder enjoying Central Park being threatened to be pursued by law enforcement for the simple slight of asking a white woman to leash her dog under city laws. I have much in common with Mr. Cooper. We’re both middle-aged African-American men, educated in elite schools (him: Harvard, myself: Yale, Trinity and Vanderbilt). We enjoy white collar careers. We have hobbies that aren’t associated with black folk. And like him, I’ve also been profiled in a negative way due to race, many times. Racism overrides status in America This should not surprise you. It’s been a fact of life for African-Americans for generations, and sadly, racism often overrides wealth, class and life standing.

But our families have “talks” with our teenage kids for a reason and they aren’t the same talks you give your kids. We have to make sure that their encounters with law enforcement or strangers don’t end badly or tragically.

When I watched the death of George Floyd under the knee of a cop in Minneapolis, my mind went back to the night I was suspected of a crime, until a fifth cop showed up and realized they had the wrong guy.

Her charges were first-degree larceny and conspiracy, to which she plead guilty. Ms. McDowell, who was homeless at the time, was sentenced to five years in prison for enrolling her son in a school district in which he did not reside. That’s right, this homeless mother of a five-year-old got five years for “stealing an education, valued at $15,000.” Before you jump to her defense, you should know that she was also charged with possession of illegal drugs and intent to sell to an undercover officer. Does that make you less outraged? It shouldn’t. It’s been 152 years since the passage of the Equal Protection Act, but the sad reality is that few people in the black community feel anything close to equality or protected. Instead, we feel isolated and ignored, ignited by injustice and angry in the form of riots and righteous protest. In his seminal book, “Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community,” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. laid out a step-by-step plan to bridge the racial divide that persists in our country. Two key components of his plan were empathy and education – which brings us back to Ms. McDowell and her son. Hear more Tennessee Voices:Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought provoking columns. Eight years after she was imprisoned for “stealing"" an education for her child, young black men are being terrorized and killed by police officers who demonstrate little empathy or cultural education — even while being filmed. By enacting the Equal Protection Act, the United States forever established that ""all lives matter."" The problem is, many black people still live with the social philosophy that we must be twice as good to receive our just due. And worse, too few white Americans are willing to prioritize real progress over self-interest. Living this way takes a toll Even though she will never win parent-of-the-year, Tanya McDowell had an abiding belief that a quality education would position her son for a better life, and that his presence in a mostly-white school would influence his classmates towards greater empathy and understanding. But instead, the opposite happened. Imprisoned by poverty, her son found no favor, and his mother found no forgiveness. Black lives must matter. I’m a 40-year-old black man and I’m afraid because of the microaggressions I personally experience every single day. I’m afraid because I see myself in Mike Brown, Amadou Diallo, Eric Garner, Trevon Martin, Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd. I’m afraid because I feel the need to justify my humanity to many of my white brothers and sisters. I’m afraid because I can’t think of a solution. And, because I’m afraid, today my fear manifests as rage. If America continues to show such gross incompetence in protecting black lives, it will force each of us to choose, metaphorically, between the ballot or the bullet. The ballot represents real change – the collective courage to confront ignorance, reject racism and embrace the truth that “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” The bullet, on the other hand, represents extreme nationalism and destructive division. The bullet approach is primal and swift, but never satisfying. Engaged community or enraging chaos? Devin DeLaughter has been named Father Ryan's next athletic director.

JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (WJHL) – Cracked teeth, bruises and a dislocated shoulder. Protesters who took to Johnson City streets Monday night said officers injured them during demonstrations that stretched into the early hours on Tuesday. Almost 12 hours after they were arrested, 11 protesters left the Washington County Detention Center, and many say they plan a return to the streets Tuesday night. Previous story: Protests last into the night in Johnson City; 11 arrested Some bore injuries they say they received while being arrested for protesting police brutality. Protests both peaceful and violent continue spreading across the nation in the wake of George Floyd’s death, a black man who died in the custody of Minneapolis police while being arrested for allegedly passing a counterfeit bill. Jeff Clark, a private citizen and the vice president of the Washington County Young Democrats, bailed nine of the 11 protesters out of jail for a total of $7,300 on Tuesday and said he’ll return to the detention center on Wednesday to bail out any protesters who may be arrested Tuesday. Clark set up a fundraiser to help make bail for the protesters. As of 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, the fundraiser has collected more than $11,000. “I’m concerned that these people were imprisoned for performing their first amendment rights to protest,” Clark said. “This isn’t going to be the last time unless things rapidly change. I understand the anger.” Elizabeth Allen left the detention center with a split chin, scrapes and cracked teeth that she says she got when officers arrested her. Allen said she was watching officers arrest a female protester when her breasts were exposed to the crowd. Allen said she attempted to fix the woman’s shirt, and an officer “tackled” her to the ground. “Two full-sized, 200-plus pound men were on me,” Allen said, adding, “They (the officers) put me down on the ground with such force that my jaw, obviously knocked down on the pavement, split open and blood was pouring from my jaw and into my hair and on the ground.” Protestor, Elizabeth Allen, shows us the injuries she sustained after she says she was thrown to the ground by police last night.

Carpenter said she watched in horror as officers “slammed” her son to the ground and he was “held down with a knee on his neck.” She called it the scariest moment of her life. “I’m still hurt (by) this,” she said, adding that she fears for the lives of her son and other black children. “I mean, my son and none of these kids asked for this.” Angela Carpenter said that she watched her son Dezmond get arrested on a livestream.

According to the report from the Johnson City Police Department, Carpenter was also charged with unlawful possession of a weapon after a jail employee found a handgun in his backpack, and Carpenter could not produce a state handgun carry permit. Officials also discovered that Carpenter had outstanding arrest warrants for aggravated burglary and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, which set his bond higher than those of the other arrested demonstrators. Demonstrator Naythan Matherly said officers dislocated his shoulder while arresting him. He also pointed to several scrapes and bruises that he said he received from officers arresting him. He said police began “throwing” protesters “to the ground” when the demonstrators locked arms in a non-violent demonstration in the street. He said after he was arrested, repeated requests for medical assistance were denied. Demonstrator Naythan Matherly said he sustained injuries including a dislocated shoulder when police arrested him early Tuesday morning after hours of protest. Matherly is one of the many protesters who said he plans to return to the streets tonight. He decried the reponse from officers on Monday night, and described officers’ response to the demonstrations last night as “overkill” and that it “pushed protesters over the edge.” “In other cities, they’re burning down buildings and breaking glass and everything and still just pushing them,” he said. “You don’t hit people, you can’t. That’s assault. “ Police Chief Karl Turner said during a press conference Tuesday afternoon that a few Troopers were assaulted as arrests were being made. He acknowledged that one woman suffered a split chin and declined medical attention. Mayor Jenny Brock said officials began taking part in demonstrations that began in Founders Park Monday evening, but that a band of protesters left those demonstrations early and began marching in the streets. She said there was a group that ""hijacked"" that left Founders Park early and led a march down the street — Jessica Fuller WJHL (@fullerjf91) June 2, 2020 Turner, who said he’d planned to march with protesters, said he couldn’t participate because people began blocking traffic in the road. Officials said the concern lies partly in the safety of the demonstrators – City Manager Pete Peterson cited the danger protesters face in the road at night, where motorists may not be able to see them. The Johnson City Police Department provided one report when asked for the arrest reports for all 11 demonstrators. The report does not indicate whether officers used force to arrest demonstrators. According to the report, officers asked protesters to move onto the sidewalk several times when they began blocking four lanes of traffic on West State of Franklin Road with their bodies. Twice, police formed a line and began to advance toward the demonstrators, according to the report, and commanded them to move out of the roadway. When the protesters refused to move, officers took them into custody, the report said. Washington County deputies, Tennessee State Troopers and Greeneville City Police Officers joined JCPD officers after a call for mutual aid. Protesters said they plan to continue demonstrations beginning at 6 p.m. in Founders Park. Brock said she planned to march with demonstrators if they remain on the sidewalk and don’t march in the street.",0.0

(AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) WASHINGTON (AP) — Protests were largely peaceful and the nation’s streets were calmer than they have been in days since the killing of George Floyd set off demonstrations that at times brought violence and destruction along with pleas to stop police brutality and injustice against African Americans. There were scattered reports of looting in New York City overnight, and as of Wednesday morning there had been over 9,000 arrests nationwide since the unrest began following Floyd’s death May 25 in Minneapolis. But there was a marked quiet compared with the unrest of the past few nights, which included fires and shootings in some cities. The calmer night came as many cities intensified their curfews, with authorities in New York and Washington ordering people off streets while it was still daylight. A block away from the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed following a crackdown a day earlier when officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove peaceful protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. Tuesday’s protesters faced law enforcement personnel who stood behind a black chain-link fence that was put up overnight to block access to the park. With a thin crowd at the end of the night, after some protesters shake the fence, military police begins shooting them with non-lethal bullets and smoke.

The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the crowd Tuesday was peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” Pope Francis on Wednesday called for national reconciliation and peace. Francis said that he has ‘’witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest’’ in the United States in recent days. “My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,’’ the pope said during his weekly Wednesday audience, held in the presence of bishops due to coronavirus restrictions on gatherings. Trump, meanwhile, amplified his hard-line calls from Monday, when he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” Thousands of people remained in the streets of New York City Tuesday night, undeterred by an 8 p.m. curfew, though most streets were clear by early Wednesday other than police who were patrolling some areas. Midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Protests also passed across the U.S., including in Los Angeles, Miami, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina and Houston, where the police chief talked to peaceful demonstrators, vowing reforms. “God as my witness, change is coming,” Art Acevedo said. “And we’re going to do it the right way.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence.

The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with murder. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that tested the nation’s ability to run elections while balancing a pandemic and sweeping social unrest. Joe Biden won hundreds more delegates and was on the cusp of formally securing the Democratic presidential nomination. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities.",0.0

Story Highlights Lloyd Kramer is a professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and the author of ""Nationalism in Europe & America: Politics, Cultures, and Identities Since 1775."" The Billy Graham Crusade at Neyland Stadium in May 1970 was a major transitional event in my life because I was arrested there for “disrupting a religious service” and shouting “public obscenities.” After 50 eventful years, it still influences how I understand my personal history as well as the history of modern America. I was a 20-year-old student at Maryville College in that tumultuous month when President Richard Nixon ordered the American invasion of Cambodia, National Guardsmen killed four anti-war protesters at Kent State University and demonstrations erupted across the country. The announcement that Nixon would attend Billy Graham’s Crusade at the University of Tennessee attracted attention because it would be the president’s first campus visit since the Cambodian invasion, and I quickly decided with some friends that we should attend the crusade to protest the war in Vietnam and Cambodia. I came from a family with deep roots in East Tennessee. My maternal grandfather was a Presbyterian minister who had long served as president of Maryville College. My paternal grandfather was a prominent attorney who had founded a well-known Knoxville law firm. My parents both grew up in Maryville, and I was born there, too. Although I later lived in Arkansas and Indiana, Blount County was the family homeland to which I returned for a college education. War protesters at the crusade My youthful identity was therefore shaped by strong family values, religious traditions, deep beliefs in America’s democratic political system and vague ambitions that I might one day become a candidate for legislative office. By 1970, however, I also believed that the Vietnam War was an immoral foreign intervention and a dangerous threat to America’s national well-being. So I joined the anti-war protest at the Billy Graham Crusade on May 28, sitting quietly amid a small group whose signs quoted the biblical commandment “Thou Shall Not Kill.” Buy Photo Organizers and officials pose for a photo with Rev. Billy Graham, in dark suit at center, at the Knoxville crusade at Neyland Stadium. (Photo: News Sentinel archives) Although we were vastly outnumbered by the crowd that came to see Nixon and Graham, a few rowdy protesters shouted obscenities when the president was described as a peacemaker and when Nixon himself praised the “great silent majority” for their support. I stayed with my friends for the whole service, but as we left our seats two plainclothes policemen grabbed my long-haired college roommate and me, charging that we had disrupted the crusade by shouting obscenities. I immediately denied that we had shouted at anyone, whereupon the police took us to the Knoxville jail. Your state. Your stories. Support more reporting like this.

Arrested but privileged As a privileged young white man, I had not learned what young black men already know well by age 20: People can be promptly arrested for looking like “the wrong kind of person” or for standing in “the wrong place.” The advantages of a privileged family life nevertheless soon reappeared when my lawyer-uncle bailed me out of jail and when my college president arranged for my roommate and me to meet with Graham in his trailer before the final crusade service on Memorial Day.

Bill Brock III, Nixon, and first lady Pat Nixon. (News Sentinel Archive) (Photo: KNS Archive) I still have clear memories of that conversation because I naively assumed that if we told Graham about the injustice of our arrests and explained how Nixon had “used” the crusade for his own political purposes, he would see the truth and urge dismissal of our pending charges. Graham, of course, did not accept our interpretation of either the arrests or Nixon’s visit. He kindly noted instead that he had befriended every recent president, and Nixon’s Knoxville stopover was simply another example of a good friendship. We were then ushered from Graham’s trailer into the final crusade service, which dramatically combined a passionate sermon with Memorial Day patriotism and an expansive display of flapping American flags.

A career in law and politics seemed less appealing or available after 1970, but historical studies provided empowering knowledge that helped me understand how our personal lives intersect with unexpected public upheavals that alter our plans and change our identities. Looking back over these past 50 years, I can now see more clearly how Graham’s Knoxville crusade exemplified major historical trends that still shape American society in 2020.

(KNS Archive) (Photo: News Sentinel) Nationalism and religion First, the crusade presented a beautifully staged fusion of nationalism and religion, thereby generating an emotional linkage that has retained its power from the age of Nixon to the age of Donald Trump. Nationalist rituals and symbols always take on quasi-religious meanings, but nationalism becomes even more persuasive when it merges with the messages and leaders at religious celebrations such as Graham’s crusades.

(NEWS SENTINEL ARCHIVE) (Photo: KNS Archive) Fear of 'the other' Second, the rage against anti-war protesters in May 1970 expressed an angry “fear of the other” that continues to shape our cultural and political life. I remember the surrounding hostility as the police led me out of Neyland Stadium, and I’ve never forgotten how state leaders condemned the protesters as people who hated America. Despite my East Tennessee roots, I experienced the frightening dehumanization that unpopular “outsiders” face constantly in their daily lives.

It was Nixon's first appearance at a college campus since the Kent State shootings earlier in the month. (University of Tennessee Libraries) (Photo: University of Tennessee Libraries) Identity politics Finally, the Billy Graham Crusade became a 20th-century prelude for the “identity politics” that now dominate American culture and politics. People conveyed their personal identities and political values through their clothing, hairstyles, flags and peace signs. The tribal identities that collided in Neyland Stadium asserted opposing conceptions of self-hood that have intensified all of America’s later political debates. The events of that long-ago Billy Graham Crusade therefore remind me that our personal choices must always be made in historical contexts that we cannot control and that our personal lives always bring us to unexpected places and experiences. More generally, the enduring legacies of the crusade still demand attention, even from those who were not there and especially from those who want to understand the nationalist religion, political scapegoating and polarizing cultural identities that permeate modern American society.

1624262720,2020-06-01 23:44:22,A protester asked the Tennessee National Guard to lay down their riot shields.

They did. Jones and other demonstrators had gathered for a vigil at the steps of the Capitol building in Nashville on Monday evening as protests against police brutality and racism continued around the country. The vigil took place as the Tennessee General Assembly reconvened at the Capitol after suspending this year's session in March due to the coronavirus. Several Democrats had walked down to join the demonstrators while their party colleagues and Republicans watched from the Capitol balcony. Jones has led protests in Nashville for years, including at the Capitol. Hundreds gathered at the Legislative Plaza across from the Capitol to mourn the lives of black men and women killed by police. The crowd sang, prayed and chanted together before moving their group to the steps of the Capitol while they sang ""This Little Light of Mine."" Protesting is a family affair Lacrisha Johnson, 31, attended the vigil with her 5-year-old daughter, Kingsley. ""I have to plant the foundation for her young,"" Johnson said. ""She can see solidarity. She can see things being peaceful."" Johnson's daughter was born in 2015, months after 12-year-old Tamir Rice was killed by police in Ohio and the same year Freddie Gray was killed in Baltimore. Raising a biracial child while the killings saturated public conversation has been emotionally startling, especially as Johnson started explaining race, privilege and police violence to her daughter. ""It's extremely hard,"" she said. ""Not only was I still learning myself, I now had to articulate that for her to understand."" Part of teaching her daughter is using intentional language. ""We're out here because a man was murdered,"" Johnson said. ""I don't use the word killed. I use the word murdered. You kill a fly."" Z Hall, 30, who is from Memphis and has lived in Nashville for the last decade, said she felt called to attend the vigil because she comes from a line of protesters that stretches back to her great-grandfather and the Civil Rights Era. Generations of family members have fought for their rights to be expanded, and the tradition continues on with her. Although she doesn't have children, her friends do. She has nephews and younger family members. Watching them grow is a beautiful experience, she said, but a fear swells inside her. She's worried they could become victims of police violence. ""We lost our fathers, our grandfathers, our uncles,"" she said. ""I'm not willing to lose our children. ""It's terrifying. What do I do?"" Saturday's protest Two days before, the Legislative Plaza was the site of the ""I Will Breathe"" rally to protest the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck, and other victims of police violence. The rally was peaceful, although vandalism and altercations with police by individuals after the event led to the deployment of the National Guard and a curfew order in Nashville, which remained in effect starting at 10 p.m. Monday. Trey Gibson, 20, attended Monday night's vigil and Saturday night's protest — the first time he's attended a demonstration. He was drawn to recent protests in Nashville to speak out against police violence. He said this is the first time such protests have been organized in the area since he's become an adult and politically active. Gibson said Saturday's crowd held more anger than the vigil. Monday's gathering was about healing, and it had a clear, guided purpose, he said. Although the crowd cheered when members of the National Guard put down their shields, Gibson had a different reaction: it was a meaningful gesture, but what about accountability and action? ""I feel like it's symbolic,"" he said. ""It looks good, but I'm not buying it. I need to see something concrete. ""I'd say the majority of the police want to do good. It doesn't matter how many good cops there are if the 95% don't hold the 5% accountable."" Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump urged governors around the nation to use as many National Guard troops as possible to control the ongoing protests and threatened to deploy the U.S. military to ""solve the problem for them"" if they did not. Gibson, who is black, said he has been questioned by white people as to why he's in their neighborhoods. He said a white woman reported him to law enforcement when he was recently visiting a family member in South Nashville. The police treat young adults differently based on their schools, he said. Gibson attends Tennessee State University, a historically black university, and said their parties and gatherings are treated differently by law enforcement than what attendees of non-HBCUs experience when they host an event. Gibson encouraged white people to use their privilege and voices to enact change: show up, listen and call out injustices. ""No one can change it by themselves,"" he said. Hall agreed that white men and women should use their voices to amplify those belonging to people of color. ""We need white people,"" Hall said. ""You have to put your job on the line. Your livelihood on the line. Your body on the line."" It can be hard to hold friends and family accountable, Hall said, but it has to happen in order to enact change. Have those hard conversations and call out racism. ""If this is a revolution,"" she said, ""it has to be a revolution.""

1624264321,2020-06-03 08:11:45,DC officials push back on aggressive response to protests,http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129839,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — Officials in the nation's capital pushed back on an aggressive response by the federal government to demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, with the mayor flatly rejecting a Trump administration proposal for the federal government to take over its police force and one Virginia county pulling its officers from Washington. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies, and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr, who is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city, promised by Tuesday ""even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region."" District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said the Trump administration floated the idea of taking over the Metropolitan Police Department, a proposal she strongly rejected. She threatened to take legal action if the federal government attempted to do so. Hours before a 7 p.m. curfew Tuesday, cars were being stopped at military checkpoints in downtown Washington and a cavalry of armored military vehicles could be seen driving through the district. Two Defense Department officials said the Trump administration had ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a ""show of force"" against demonstrators protesting the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Police made over 300 arrests, mainly for violating the district's curfew. Earlier Monday evening, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback moved aggressively to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Donald Trump's walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, Arlington County in Virginia pulled out its officers, saying they were used ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she's ""appalled"" that the mutual aid agreement was abused ""for a photo op."" In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have aided each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in Washington on Saturday and Sunday without incident. Arlington County officials said in a statement their officers never wielded their batons and did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas. But after watching the scene unfold on live television, the police chief ordered all the officers to return to Virginia. ""This unprecedented decision by the County was a necessary response to an unprecedented situation,"" the statement said. Officials said they were reevaluating the mutual aid agreements to ensure officers ""are never again put in a situation where they are asked to take action that is inconsistent with our values."" The U.S. Park Police on Tuesday defended its actions at the park, saying it issued three warnings over a loudspeaker before clearing the area of protesters, some of whom they said were becoming violent, throwing projectiles and trying to grab weapons. It said it used smoke canisters and pepper balls to disperse the crowd. Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear the park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, ahead of the president's remarks, leading to police using force to disperse protesters, a person familiar with the matter told the AP. Officials had decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block, after multiple fires were set in the park the night before, the person said. When Barr arrived, he was surprised it hadn't been done and directed action to be taken, according to the person, who could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. In a Monday call with governors, Trump and Barr had encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country. Trump said he was ""taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America."" The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. The federal government has provided affected states with a list of available National Guard resources, a White House official said. The official added that Trump's message to governors was if they don't use the tools in their arsenal they shouldn't expect a sympathetic response from Washington if they request federal dollars to help with clean-up and recovery down the line. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Other law enforcement resources were also being mobilized in Washington. The Justice Department had deployed agents from every one of its agencies, including the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, and riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other Homeland Security agencies were also dispatched. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other ""anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the ""violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups"" as domestic terrorism. Although there isn't a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Lolita C.

1624264306,2020-06-03 08:10:32,AP sources: White House softens on sending troops to states,http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129836,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 Esper says no military for protests as standby troops leave Print | Front Page | Email this story To:  From:  Message: From (email):  Message:  WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Wednesday he opposes using military forces for law enforcement in containing current street protests, tamping down threats from President Donald Trump, who had warned states he was willing to send troops to ""dominate"" the streets. Less than 48 hours after the president threatened to use the Insurrection Act of 1807 to contain protests if governors were not able to get a handle on unrest, Esper said it should be invoked in the United States ""only in the most urgent and dire of situations."" He declared, ""We are not in one of those situations now."" Esper, at Trump's encouragement, had already authorized the movement of about 1,300 active-duty Army units to military bases just outside the nation's capital, but they have not entered the city — and defense officials said some of the troops were beginning to return to their home bases Wednesday. White House officials indicated even before Esper's comments that Trump was backing away from invoking the Insurrection Act. At the same time, the president was taking credit for the deployment of federal and other law enforcement officers to the nation's capital, saying it offered a model to states on how to stop violence accompanying some protests nationwide. Trump argued that the massive show of force was responsible for protests in Washington and other cities turning more calm in recent days and repeated his criticism of governors who have not deployed their National Guard to the fullest. ""You have to have a dominant force,"" Trump told Fox New Radio on Wednesday. ""We need law and order."" Esper, in his Pentagon remarks, strongly criticized the actions of the Minneapolis police for the incident last week that ignited the protests. In their custody, a black man, George Floyd, died after a white officer pressed his knee to Floyd's neck for several minutes. Esper called the act ""murder"" and ""a horrible crime."" Esper himself has come under fire from critics, including retired senior military officers, for having walked from the White House on Monday evening with Trump and others for a presidential photo opportunity in front of St. John's Episcopal Church, which had previously sustained damage from protesters. Esper said that while he was aware they were heading to St. John's, he did not know what would happen there. ""I was not aware a photo op was happening,"" he said, adding that he also did not know that police had forcibly moved peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square to clear the way for Trump and his entourage. Trump put a political spin on his criticism of states with violence. He said, ""You notice that all of these places that have problems, they're not run by Republicans. They're run by liberal Democrats."" The Defense Department has drafted contingency plans for deploying active-duty military if needed. Pentagon documents reviewed by The Associated Press showed plans for soldiers from an Army division to protect the White House and other federal buildings if the security situation in the nation's capital were to deteriorate and the National Guard could not secure the facilities. But interest in exerting that extraordinary federal authority appeared to be waning in the White House. Though the crackdown on the Washington demonstrations was praised by some Trump supporters Tuesday, a handful of Republicans expressed concern that law enforcement officers risked violating the protesters' First Amendment rights. The situation in Washington had escalated Monday, becoming a potent symbol of Trump's policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Nearly 30 minutes before a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington, U.S. Park Police repelled protesters with what they said were smoke canisters and pepper balls. The clampdown followed a weekend of demonstrations outside the White House. Trump had been furious about images juxtaposing fires set in the park outside the executive mansion with a darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials. He was also angry about the news coverage revealing he had gone to the White House bunker during Friday's protests. In a Monday address in the Rose Garden, he called on governors to ramp up the National Guard presence to tamp down the protests. If they didn't, Trump said, he would dispatch the military to their states — a step rarely taken in modern American history. On Monday, 715 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division arrived in the capital area in case the situation in Washington escalated. They were stationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Two more 82nd Airborne battalions, totaling 1,300 soldiers, were on standby at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, according to documents reviewed by the AP. Administration officials were privately acknowledging that Monday's events didn't serve the administration well. Some Republican lawmakers, typically in lockstep with the president or at least refrain from publicly criticizing him, said Trump had gone too far in appearing to use force to clear the way for his visit to the church. ""There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property, and no right to throw rocks at police,"" said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. ""But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop."" Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible, ""I just wish he opened it once in a while."" It was Attorney General William Barr who gave the order for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump's walk to the church ahead of Washington's 7 p.m. curfew. A person familiar with the matter said the decision was made earlier Monday, but had not been executed by the time Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to survey the scene. He verbally gave the order at that time. ___ AP writers James LaPorta in Delray Beach, Florida, Jonathan Lemire in New York, Michael Balsamo in Washington and Sarah Blake Morgan in West Jefferson, North Carolina, contributed.",0.0
1624264299,2020-06-03 08:11:19,"Nation's streets calmest in days, protests largely peaceful",http://www.nashvilleledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=129838,en,True,,285648,tnledger.com,http://tnledger.com/,"VOL. 44 | NO. 22 | Friday, May 29, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — Protests were largely peaceful and the nation's streets were calmer than they have been in days since the killing of George Floyd set off sometimes violent demonstrations against police brutality and injustice against African Americans. An earlier curfew and efforts by protesters to contain the violence prevented more widespread damage to businesses in New York City overnight. As of Wednesday morning, arrests grew to more than 9,000 nationwide since the unrest began in response to Floyd's death May 25 in Minneapolis. There was a marked quiet compared with the unrest of the past few nights, which included fires and shootings in some cities. Many cities intensified their curfews, with authorities in Washington also ordering people off streets before sundown. A block away from the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed following a crackdown a day earlier when officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove peaceful protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John's Church. Tuesday's protesters faced law enforcement personnel who stood behind a black chain-link fence put up overnight to block access to the park. ""Last night pushed me way over the edge,"" said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. ""Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless."" Pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. The crowd remained in place after the city's 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the people were peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: ""Peaceful protest!"" Pope Francis called for national reconciliation and peace, saying he has ''witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest'' in the United States in recent days. ""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,'' the pope said during his weekly Wednesday audience, held in the presence of bishops due to coronavirus restrictions on gatherings. Trump, meanwhile, amplified his hard-line calls from Monday, when he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn't do it. ""NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,"" he tweeted. ""The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!"" Thousands of people remained in the streets of New York City Tuesday night, undeterred by an 8 p.m. curfew, though most streets were clear by early Wednesday. Midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday's protests. Protests also passed across the U.S., including in Los Angeles, Miami, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina and Houston, where the police chief talked to peaceful demonstrators, vowing reforms. ""God as my witness, change is coming,"" Art Acevedo said. ""And we're going to do it the right way."" More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. Not in New York City, where Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard, despite an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo. On Tuesday, Cuomo called what happened in the city Monday night ""a disgrace."" ""The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job,"" Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said his fellow Democrat underestimated the problem, and the nation's largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of protests that began after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd's neck while the handcuffed black man called out that he couldn't breathe. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with murder. The mother of George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wants the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. ""I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,"" Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference, her daughter at her side. ""I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good."" Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after seemingly incessant killings by police. ""It feels like it's just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing's really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,"" said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. ""There's always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we're seeing the breaking point around the country."" ""I live in this state. It's really painful to see what's going on, but it's also really important to understand that it's connected to a system of racial violence,"" she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump's threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president is not rushing to deploy the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries on Tuesday, testing the nation's ability to run elections while balancing a pandemic and sweeping social unrest. Joe Biden won hundreds more delegates, nearly enough to formally secure the Democratic presidential nomination. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. ___ Sullivan reported from Minneapolis.

At a news conference, Tennessee Adjutant General Jeff Holmes said he received the request this week from the chief of the National Guard Bureau, Gen. Joseph Lengyel. Holmes says he expects the members from the 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Knoxville to be on the ground in Washington by Saturday. Tennessee is one of several states to send National Guard troops to Washington, a move requested by President Donald Trump. At least three states — New York, Virginia and Delaware — have so far rejected the request. On Sunday, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee mobilized the National Guard across the state following violent protests in Nashville the previous day. In the Memphis area Tuesday, demonstrations were held for the seventh straight night. One group held a downtown rally and march to the Mason Temple, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his ""I've Been to the Mountaintop"" speech on April 3, 1968. King was in Memphis to support a sanitation workers' strike. He was killed the next day while standing on the balcony of the old Lorraine Motel. Across Shelby County, a gathering of protesters blocked an intersection in the mostly-white suburb of Germantown. While demonstrations in Memphis have been mostly peaceful, there have been some clashes between police and protesters. A curfew is in effect from 10 p.m. through 6 a.m.",0.0

Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost,” he urged. CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John Allen said it is “relatively rare” for the Pope to mention a specific person by name.

Though a handful of residents voiced their disdain for a property tax increase, including an individual against the calls to slash the police department's budget, the conversation lasted until 4:30 a.m. Wednesday and was almost completely focused on budget priorities and on reducing funding for police. The emphatic message follows a weekend of protesting and rallying from the black community and other residents decrying systemic racism, police brutality and the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and other black men and women in Nashville and across the country. An initial attempt to pause the public hearing compounded frustrations from residents who viewed the immense public engagement as a form of protest — the very kind officials have called for as they have condemned the disruption and damage that occurred in downtown on Saturday. Some spoke from a script that appeared guided by information shared by a coalition behind the Nashville People's Budget, which held a budget call Sunday that discussed how implementing a significant tax hike without also implementing a well-funded tax relief program and other social services, imposes a significant burden on residents, especially for the black and low-income communities. The Nashville People's Budget coalition involves the following groups: Black Lives Matter; Gideon's Army; Music City Riders United; No Exceptions Prison Collective; Free Hearts; People's Alliance for Transit, Housing and Equity; Southerners on New Ground Nashville; and Worker's Dignity. Fund community priorities, residents say But a wide swath of residents also spoke off the cuff about the frustrations they have experienced or witnessed in the community, including chronic underfunding of schools and pay for Metro employees and teachers falling behind. Many used the word ""defund"" in their call for reducing the police department's budget and using those savings to invest in other community programs. Several people spoke before Nashville's metro council about defunding police during a budget meeting Tuesday, June 2, 2020. (Photo: Yihyun Jeong / The Tennessean) Mayor John Cooper's ""crisis"" budget calls for a 32% property tax increase and includes cuts to step increases and cost-of-living adjustments for city employees, eliminates the Community Education Commission, and cuts funding for the Metro Arts Commissions, nonprofits and other social services. His budget however, sends more money to public safety agencies, including $2.6 million to the police — which residents came out in droves to say is an imbalance compared to needed public services. ""We're encouraged to see so many Nashvillians participate in the budget process, and we're listening closely to the ideas shared tonight,"" Cooper spokesperson Chris Song said in response to the public comments. Nashville needs a budget that funds public safety through public goods, not policing and jails, said Jamel Campbell-Gooch, a member of the Community Oversight Board and the deputy director of Gideon's Army. ""I stand here in opposition to racism, anti-blackness and any budget that does not radically change public safety,"" he said, calling Tuesday just the first step for a ""revolutionary change"" needed in Nashville. Jamel Campbell-Gooch of Gideon's Army and member of the Community Oversight Board calls today the ""first step in revolutionary change that we need here,"" while speaking to the Metro Council Tuesday, June 2, 2020. (Photo: Yihyun Jeong / The Tennessean) Anna Albescu, who said she's connected with several grassroots organizations, asked council members to make the city one she can be proud to live in. ""This budget would not make me proud,"" she said. Amanda Kail, president of the local teachers' union, came out to represent her students, saying underfunding of Metro Nashville Public Schools has greatly added to racial disparity in the city. Cooper's budget sends a flat $914.9 million for the district. MNPS officials have asked the Metro Council for nearly $15 million in additional funding to avoid cuts and to fund textbooks for students. Sara Durán, a Nashville teacher in Antioch, said the city has responded reactively with policing, rather than proactively in other areas of society to reduce violence. ""We are in a position to perpetuate racial poverty when we prioritize policing over education. We are saying that it's more important to punish than it is to build up,"" she said. Marathon meeting lasts until dawn There was an attempt to shorten the record-setting meeting. After nearly five hours, Vice Mayor Jim Shulman had heard enough. As hours carried on with a familiar theme and an unknown number of people still waiting to speak, Shulman returned from a brief recess at midnight to say he would no longer accept speakers repeating what has already been saidas residents with differing positions struggled to get a chance. Nashvillans waiting outside the chamber Tuesday, June 2, 2020 clapped each time someone comes out after speaking to council. (Photo: Yihyun Jeong / The Tennessean) ""We're at the point where we've had people basically saying the same thing to us. A solid democracy means that you allow other people to have a say,"" he said, arguing the process was ""tying up the hands of government"" as he moved on with the agenda to return to a public hearing at the end of the meeting. It spurred immediate protest from council members and the public, including those who had come to the Metro Courthouse late Tuesday night when their calls had gotten tied up in the remote queue as it reached capacity at the start of the meeting. In the hallway outside the council chambers, Shulman accused some in attendance of engaging in bad policy and bad politics, a moment captured on video. At one point, Shulman instructed security to escort people out of the building if they got ""out of hand,"" though everyone sat in spaced out chairs. Late Wednesday, Cooper posted a statement on Twitter about Shulman, saying he has listened to ""people's distress"" over the vice mayor's words. ""The Vice Mayor is an independently elected Metro official, and his words are his own,"" Cooper said. ""They do not reflect my views, or the views of my office. I fully support all public speech, and I believe every single voice must be heard.""

The Vice Mayor is an independently elected Metro official, and his words are his own.(1/2) — Mayor John Cooper (@JohnCooper4Nash) June 3, 2020 Shulman pushed forward with council business, prompting some council members who had joined the meeting remotely to log off in solidarity with those wanting to comment. After an hour into the agenda, Council member Dave Rosenberg, the chair of the council's Rules, Confirmations, and Public Elections Committee, successfully received unanimous support to return to the public hearing and to allow anyone to speak without interruption. Council member Kyonztè Toombs, the budget vice chair, said the focus of the public hearing was to hear from constituents. ""The overwhelming calls to defund the police and invest more in community resources reaffirms what I already believed and that is what as a city we need to reconsider our priorities and how we fund those priorities,"" Toombs told The Tennessean. She said more in-depth conversations are needed, including how to dole out the CARES Act funds — which she called one of the fastest ways to address some of the needs. Stand Up Nashville Executive Director Odessa Kelly, who stood in front of council for the third year calling for a tax increase, demanded the $121 million sitting in city coffers be spent immediately on those who need it the most. At nearly 5 a.m. Wednesday after the public hearing finally ended, At-large Council member Steve Glover expressed frustrations that people opposed to the tax increase were ""successfully snuffed out"" of the lengthy process. Glover called the turnout a ""scam"" that was designed toward giving an advantage toward the mayor's budget or another that would include a significant tax increase. ""I've never seen such a fiasco in my life,"" he said. The meeting, handled largely virtually, tested council members with more than eight hours spent on the budget discussion, including Shulman, who is well-respected on the council and known for convening meetings that push for more public understanding. During his recess, he went to speak to community members waiting outside, where tensions grew and he was recorded saying they were engaging in ""bad politics."" He came back to the chamber to say that he had been informed that constituents with differing opinions on the budget and a tax increase said they hadn't been able to speak. At-large Council member Bob Mendes said he understood frustrations but said that the voices heard during the meeting should not be diminished as they were genuinely shared with council members. ""For anyone worried about the events of last Saturday in Nashville, tonight is an incredible show of force for democracy,"" Mendes told The Tennessean, calling it inspiring to see the public turnout to engage on the budget.

They did. Jones and other demonstrators had gathered for a vigil at the steps of the Capitol building in Nashville on Monday evening as protests against police brutality and racism continued around the country. The vigil took place as the Tennessee General Assembly reconvened at the Capitol after suspending this year's session in March due to the coronavirus. Several Democrats had walked down to join the demonstrators while their party colleagues and Republicans watched from the Capitol balcony. Jones has led protests in Nashville for years, including at the Capitol. Hundreds gathered at the Legislative Plaza across from the Capitol to mourn the lives of black men and women killed by police. The crowd sang, prayed and chanted together before moving their group to the steps of the Capitol while they sang ""This Little Light of Mine."" Protesting is a family affair Lacrisha Johnson, 31, attended the vigil with her 5-year-old daughter, Kingsley. ""I have to plant the foundation for her young,"" Johnson said. ""She can see solidarity. She can see things being peaceful."" Johnson's daughter was born in 2015, months after 12-year-old Tamir Rice was killed by police in Ohio and the same year Freddie Gray was killed in Baltimore. Raising a biracial child while the killings saturated public conversation has been emotionally startling, especially as Johnson started explaining race, privilege and police violence to her daughter. ""It's extremely hard,"" she said. ""Not only was I still learning myself, I now had to articulate that for her to understand."" Part of teaching her daughter is using intentional language. ""We're out here because a man was murdered,"" Johnson said. ""I don't use the word killed. I use the word murdered. You kill a fly."" Z Hall, 30, who is from Memphis and has lived in Nashville for the last decade, said she felt called to attend the vigil because she comes from a line of protesters that stretches back to her great-grandfather and the Civil Rights Era. Generations of family members have fought for their rights to be expanded, and the tradition continues on with her. Although she doesn't have children, her friends do. She has nephews and younger family members. Watching them grow is a beautiful experience, she said, but a fear swells inside her. She's worried they could become victims of police violence. ""We lost our fathers, our grandfathers, our uncles,"" she said. ""I'm not willing to lose our children. ""It's terrifying. What do I do?"" Saturday's protest Two days before, the Legislative Plaza was the site of the ""I Will Breathe"" rally to protest the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck, and other victims of police violence. The rally was peaceful, although vandalism and altercations with police by individuals after the event led to the deployment of the National Guard and a curfew order in Nashville, which remained in effect starting at 10 p.m. Monday. Trey Gibson, 20, attended Monday night's vigil and Saturday night's protest — the first time he's attended a demonstration. He was drawn to recent protests in Nashville to speak out against police violence. He said this is the first time such protests have been organized in the area since he's become an adult and politically active. Gibson said Saturday's crowd held more anger than the vigil. Monday's gathering was about healing, and it had a clear, guided purpose, he said. Although the crowd cheered when members of the National Guard put down their shields, Gibson had a different reaction: it was a meaningful gesture, but what about accountability and action? ""I feel like it's symbolic,"" he said. ""It looks good, but I'm not buying it. I need to see something concrete. ""I'd say the majority of the police want to do good. It doesn't matter how many good cops there are if the 95% don't hold the 5% accountable."" Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump urged governors around the nation to use as many National Guard troops as possible to control the ongoing protests and threatened to deploy the U.S. military to ""solve the problem for them"" if they did not. Gibson, who is black, said he has been questioned by white people as to why he's in their neighborhoods. He said a white woman reported him to law enforcement when he was recently visiting a family member in South Nashville. The police treat young adults differently based on their schools, he said. Gibson attends Tennessee State University, a historically black university, and said their parties and gatherings are treated differently by law enforcement than what attendees of non-HBCUs experience when they host an event. Gibson encouraged white people to use their privilege and voices to enact change: show up, listen and call out injustices. ""No one can change it by themselves,"" he said. Hall agreed that white men and women should use their voices to amplify those belonging to people of color. ""We need white people,"" Hall said. ""You have to put your job on the line. Your livelihood on the line. Your body on the line."" It can be hard to hold friends and family accountable, Hall said, but it has to happen in order to enact change. Have those hard conversations and call out racism. ""If this is a revolution,"" she said, ""it has to be a revolution.""

1624318174,2020-06-03 07:59:00,How Much Do We Need The Police?,https://www.wknofm.org/post/how-much-do-we-need-police,en,False,"politics and government, labor, blacks, police",90047,wknofm.org,http://wknofm.org/#spider,"One effect of the widespread protests across U.S. cities this week has been to renew discussions of what role the police should play in society. For many Americans, it goes without saying that the police are critical in maintaining public safety. Have an emergency? Call the police. But many others — especially black people and poor people — have long countered that the police pose more of a threat to their safety than a boon. See a police officer? Walk in the other direction. So it seems like a good moment to talk to Alex S. Vitale. He's the author of the 2017 book The End of Policing. In it, he argues that rather than focus on police reform or officer retraining, the country needs to reconsider fundamentally what it is the police should be doing at all. I spoke with Vitale about what roles police should and shouldn't play, what he makes of the current protests and what actual change in the way police in this country do their jobs might look like. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. One of the arguments you make in The End of Policing is that police are being asked to do too much. They're basically being tasked with addressing every social problem that we have. So what are police asked to do? And what should they be asked to do? One of the problems that we're encountering here is this massive expansion in the scope of policing over the last 40 years or so. Policing is now happening in our schools. It's happening in relation to the problems of homelessness, untreated mental illness, youth violence and some things that we historically associate police with. But the policing has become more intensive, more invasive, more aggressive. So what I'm calling for is a rethink on why we've turned all of these social problems over to the police to manage. And as we dial those things back, then we can think more concretely about what the rest of policing should look like and how that could be reformed. You brought up homelessness. In many cities police are tasked with dealing with people experiencing homelessness — but they don't have many options besides basically moving people or arresting them. Well, we've created this situation where our political leaders have basically abandoned the possibility of actually housing people. Which, of course, is the real solution, supportive housing for those who need extra support. But basically, we have a massive failure in housing markets that is unable to provide basic shelter for millions of Americans. So instead of actually addressing that fundamental problem, we have relabeled it as a problem that is the fault of the disorderly people who we label as morally deficient. And then we use police to criminalize them, to control their behavior and to reduce their disorderly impact on the rest of us. And this is perverse and unjust. So then it places police in this completely untenable situation, because they completely lack the tools to make this problem any better. And yet we've told them it's their problem to manage. ... Part of our misunderstanding about the nature of policing is we keep imagining that we can turn police into social workers. That we can make them nice, friendly community outreach workers. But police are violence workers. That's what distinguishes them from all other government functions. ... They have the legal capacity to use violence in situations where the average citizen would be arrested. So when we turn a problem over to the police to manage, there will be violence, because those are ultimately the tools that they are most equipped to utilize: handcuffs, threats, guns, arrests. That's what really is at the root of policing. So if we don't want violence, we should try to figure out how to not get the police involved. There are obviously a lot of people who agree broadly with the notion that the way that policing happens in this country is a problem and that there needs to be some sort of change. But they're pretty invested in the idea that police are needed to maintain public safety. People ask the question, without police, what do you do when someone gets murdered? What do you do when someone's house gets robbed? What do you say to those people who have those concerns? Well, I'm certainly not talking about any kind of scenario where tomorrow someone just flips a switch and there are no police. What I'm talking about is the systematic questioning of the specific roles that police currently undertake, and attempting to develop evidence-based alternatives so that we can dial back our reliance on them. And my feeling is that this encompasses actually the vast majority of what police do. We have better alternatives for them. Even if you take something like burglary — a huge amount of burglary activity is driven by drug use. And we need to completely rethink our approach to drugs so that property crime isn't the primary way that people access drugs. We don't have any part of this country that has high-quality medical drug treatment on demand. But we have policing on demand everywhere. And it's not working. Obviously, a big part of what is on people's minds right now is the role that police have in dealing with protesters, dealing with different types of political unrest. In your book, you talk a lot about the history of how police have been used to quell social unrest. Can you talk about that history a little bit? Well, I think that one of the myths we have about policing is that it is politically neutral, and that it is always here to sort of create order in a way that benefits everyone. But the reality is that America's social order has never been entirely equitable. We have a long history of exploitation of the Indigenous population, of African Americans through slavery, Jim Crow and today. And while we're not using police to manage slavery or colonialism today, we are using police to manage the problems that our very unequal system has produced. We're invested in this kind of austerity politics that says the government can't afford to really do anything to lift people up. We have to put all our resources into subsidizing the already most successful parts of the economy. But those parts of the economy are producing this huge group of people who are homeless, unemployed, have untreated mental health and substance abuse problems. And then we ask the police to put a lid on those problems — to manage them so they don't interfere with the ""order"" that we're supposedly all benefiting from. But if you're one of those poor people, one of those folks with a mental health problem, someone who's involved in black market activities to survive, then you experience this as constant criminalization. And would you say the same goes for people who are political protesters? Political protest has always been a part of this dynamic, right? Political protests are a threat to the order of this system. And so policing has always been the primary tool for managing those threats to the public order. Just as we understand the use of police to deal with homelessness as a political failure, every time we turn a political order problem over to the police to manage, that's also a political failure. I think the mayor of Minneapolis, for instance: Jacob Frey. He has consistently tried to frame this as a problem of a few bad apples. And he says, ""Why are you protesting? We fired them."" But this completely misunderstands the nature of the grievances. And instead of actually addressing those grievances, he's throwing police at the problem. Are the interactions that are happening right now between police and protesters something that you think is predictable? Or is this something new that we haven't seen before? It's not completely new; it's just the intensity of it compared [with], let's say, five years ago during the Eric Garner and the Mike Brown protests. What we're seeing is really an immediate escalation to very high levels of force, a high degree of confrontation. And I think part of it is driven by deep frustration within policing, which is that police feel under assault, and they have no answer. They trotted out all the possible solutions: police-community dialogue sessions, implicit bias training, community policing, body cameras. And it just didn't work. It didn't make any difference. And so they ran out of excuses. So the protests today are a much more kind of existential threat to the police. And the police are overreacting as a result. If we were to take serious steps toward moving in the direction of having police address fewer of our social problems and putting those problems in the hands of people who are actually more equipped to deal with them, what would be the next step? What is the next thing that we as a country have to push for? I think this will look like a series of local budget battles. And that's really what's going on across the country, is when we have these divest campaigns in places like Los Angeles and Minneapolis and New York and Durham, N.C., and Nashville, Tenn., and Dallas, Texas. These are folks who are saying concretely: ""We don't want police in our schools. We want that money spent in ways that help our children, not criminalize them. We don't want more money for overtime for narcotics officers. We want actual drug treatment programs, safe injection facilities, things that will help people."" So that's what this looks like. It's about rallying city council members and mayors around a new vision of creating healthier communities. When you're looking around at what's happening right now, what are the things that you think people need to understand to really process what is going on around the country? Well, I think the police are making the argument for us, right? People started this conversation by saying policing is out of control; they're not making the situation better. They have not been reformed. Well, now all you have to do is turn on the nightly news and see how true that is. The level of aggression and unnecessary escalation is stark evidence of how unreformed policing is, and I argue how unreformable it is. The question is whether or not people will take it to the next step and ask the tough political questions. Why are our mayors turning this over to the police to manage? Why are we using curfews instead of having conversations? Why are we throwing protesters in prison instead of trying to figure out what's driving all of this anger? ",0.0

University of Tennessee mourning the loss of Johnny Majors The University of Tennessee releasing its response to the loss of a legendary coach and player for the Vols, Johnny Majors, “He is Tennessee and Tennessee is him.” Tennessee football legend Johnny Majors passed away early Wednesday in Knoxville. He was 85.  A 1987 inductee of the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame, John Terrill (Johnny) Majors played for the Volunteers from 1954-56 and later served as Tennessee’s head football coach from 1977-92.  Majors’ collegiate playing career alone places his among the pantheon of Tennessee’s all-time greats. His No. 45 was retired by his alma mater in 2012—one of only eight to earn that distinction.  Called Johnny “Drum” Majors during his playing days, he did it all for the Vols as a collegian—running, passing, kicking and defending. When they call the roll of the game’s great single-wing tailbacks, Majors stands at or near the top of the list.  A native of Lynchburg, Tennessee, and a graduate of Huntland High School, Majors finished his Tennessee playing career with 1,622 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns on 387 carries while also completing 54.1 percent of his passes (80 for 148) for 1,135 yards and 11 scores. He rushed for 549 yards and seven touchdowns on 108 carries in 1956.  Tennessee was 20-10-1 during his time as a Vol. Majors returned 36 punts for a 12.2-yard average and one touchdown in his career along with 15 kickoff returns for a 22.9-yard average. Majors also intercepted two passes at Tennessee and punted 83 times for a 39.1-yard average.  He earned both SEC Player of the Year honors and All-SEC selection at tailback twice, in 1955 and 1956. A unanimous All-American under coach Bowden Wyatt in 1956, he finished second in the Heisman Trophy balloting after leading the Vols to a 10-1 record, an appearance in the Sugar Bowl and a final national ranking of No. 2.  Majors was named to the Quarter-Century All-SEC team (1950-74) at running back, along with LSU’s Billy Cannon and Alabama’s Johnny Musso. When his Tennessee playing career ended, he ranked in the SEC’s all-time top 10 in total offense (2,757) and rushing (1,622) and was the league’s single-season record holder for completion percentage (61.0 percent in 1956).  The 1957 UT College of Education graduate was selected as Tennessee’s SEC Football Legend in 2002.  “I didn’t know I was a legend,” Majors said at that time. “Whatever my biography may say is good, I know why it happened… I had great support from home, unconditional love from my parents, my siblings, my wife, Mary Lynn, and children.  “I had exceptional coaching as a player from my father, Shirley Majors, and from Harvey Robinson and Bowden Wyatt, and their staffs. No man could have had a better mother than I did in Elizabeth Majors. I had special teammates who were helpful in me being as effective as I might have been. I had no excuses to fail based on the people I just mentioned whatever favorable accomplishments there might have been. I’m not the one to judge that.”  Majors was an assistant coach at Tennessee and Mississippi State before beginning a head coaching career that saw him rebuild programs at Iowa State, Pittsburgh, Tennessee and back to Pittsburgh. He won a national championship at Pitt in 1976. Majors finished with a record of 185-137-10 in 29 seasons of coaching.  Twenty-one years after his playing days were over, Majors came marching home to rebuild Tennessee’s football fortunes, much the way he did at Iowa State and Pittsburgh, and the results indicated that the coaches’ son from Huntland (Franklin County) had not lost his touch. He was 116-62-6 as head coach at Tennessee, with three conference championships (1985, 1989 and 1990) and 12 bowl appearances. He produced 15 All-America selections.  There were more great moments on Majors’ resume than could be recounted in a series of stories. As a player, he was involved in the classic Tennessee-Georgia Tech game in 1956, voted the second greatest game of all time by the Associated Press a few years later. Majors had the key pass completion to Buddy Cruze and sent Tommy Bronson hurdling the line for the game’s only score at the north end of Grant Field in Atlanta.  His 1991 Tennessee team came back from what appeared to be certain defeat in 1991 at Notre Dame, rallying from a 31-7 halftime deficit to take a 35-34 decision. His 1985 team defeated Miami in the Sugar Bowl, 35-7, a game Vol fans remember fondly to this day.  “I can safely say that playing for Johnny Majors was one of the greatest experiences of my life,” VFL and NFL television analyst Charles Davis, a member of UT’s 1985 team, said. “I have literally thought about him in some form or fashion every single day of my life since the first day I got to Tennessee. You’ll never be able to say the word ‘Tennessee’ without the name ‘Majors’ coming up very quickly in your mind. He is Tennessee and Tennessee is him.  “I was just fortunate enough to have played for him, fortunate enough to get to know him not just as a player, but as a person. He’s had a profound influence on my life and always will. I can easily say that I love the man.”  Tennessee Director of Athletics Phillip Fulmer was an assistant coach on Majors’ UT staff from 1980-92.  “It’s a sad day,” Fulmer said. “He gave many of us coaches our start in big-time college football. He mentored us, pushed us and allowed us to be part of the proud resurgence of Tennessee football. He touched and changed many lives for the good, and our thoughts are with his family, former players and great fans who are remembering him today.” Majors’ list of honors is extensive and includes the Walter Camp Coach of the Year Award, the AFCA Coach of the Year Award, the Sporting News College Football Coach of the Year Award and an SEC Coach of the Year Award. In addition to legendary UT gridiron stars such as Reggie White, Willie Gault, Harry Galbreath and Dale Carter, he also coached Hall of Famer Tony Dorsett, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1976 as he and Majors guided Pitt to the national championship.  The Majors family issued the following statement Wednesday morning:  John Terrill Majors passed away peacefully at his Knoxville home early this morning. He was 85 years old.  “It’s with a sad heart that we make this announcement,” said Mary Lynn Majors, his wife of 61 years. “John passed away this morning. He spent his last hours doing something he dearly loved: looking out over his cherished Tennessee River.”  Majors’ son, John Ireland Majors, recognizes that his father’s legacy extends well beyond the football field. “Dad’s passions and friendships were so diverse. He loved the symphony, travel, history and almost any type of museum.” Mary Elizabeth Majors, his daughter, added, “my dad was a strong and determined person. Our family will all try to live up to that legacy as we mourn his loss – and celebrate his life.”  A memorial service at St. John’s Cathedral will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, please consider contributions to the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra or the charity of your choice. University of Tennessee Tennessee Athletics also released an album of photographs featuring Majors: “Johnny Majors Through the Years Photo Gallery“ Former Vols reminisce about Majors Tennessee officials pay tribute to Johnny Majors Johnny Majors is a Tennessee icon and @Vol_Football legend who will be missed. Our prayers are with his wife Mary Lynn and the Majors family. — Gov. Bill Lee (@GovBillLee) June 3, 2020 “As a teenager, I rode the White Star Lines bus from Maryville to Knoxville and sold all my UT programs before the game started so I could watch every Johnny Majors run and pass and punt and quick kick. When he played the game, he WAS Tennessee football, and the Majors family became the First Family of Tennessee football. I got to know Johnny well when he was coach of the Volunteers, and I was university president. That friendship continued for many years. Honey and I send our sympathy and our great respect for Johnny’s life to Mary Lynn and to the entire Majors family.” United States Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) Coach Majors will always be remembered by East Tennesseans for the lasting impact he had on our community and his successful tenure as head football coach of the University of Tennessee. — Rep. Tim Burchett (@RepTimBurchett) June 3, 2020 Today the #Volunteer family lost a legend. The impact Johnny Majors made on @Vol_Football and college football will be felt for decades. Rest in peace Coach Majors. pic.twitter.com/bZP4Kj3jXs — UT System President Randy Boyd (@UT_President) June 3, 2020 I first met Johnny Majors in 1952 when he was visiting Tennessee as a prospect. He was player of the year in Tennessee high school football and he was called Johnny “Drum” Majors. We all know all the success he had as a player and as a coach. He is a true Tennessee football icon.Natalie and I and Johnny and Mary Lynn were great friends and had many good times together. He will be missed. We extend our condolences to the entire Majors family. Jim Haslam Local sports reporters remember Majors Jimmy Hyams, who is featured on The Sports Source, and co-hosts one of the state’s top-rated radio talk show SportsTalk remembers covering Majors as a sportscaster and writer, and even remembers him as a personal friend. “There are a lot of memories I have with John Majors. I covered him when I moved in 1985. So, I was there when he won his first SEC championship. It was the first title in 16 years, and then they went to the Sugar Bowl and they crushed Miami in a great scene down there. There must have been 65,000 Tennessee fans crammed into the Superdome. That was a great memory to see what that team did.” Jimmy Hyams LATEST STORIES:",0.0
1624376914,2020-06-03 07:59:00,How Much Do We Need The Police?,https://www.wmot.org/post/how-much-do-we-need-police,en,False,"politics and government, labor, blacks, police",310386,wmot.org,http://wmot.org/,"One effect of the widespread protests across U.S. cities this week has been to renew discussions of what role the police should play in society. For many Americans, it goes without saying that the police are critical in maintaining public safety. Have an emergency? Call the police. But many others — especially black people and poor people — have long countered that the police pose more of a threat to their safety than a boon. See a police officer? Walk the other direction. So it seems like a good moment to talk to Alex S. Vitale. He's the author of the 2017 book The End of Policing. In it, he argues that rather than focus on police reform or officer retraining, the country needs to fundamentally reconsider what it is the police should be doing at all. I spoke with Vitale about what roles police should and shouldn't play, what he makes of the current protests and what actual change in the way police in this country do their jobs might look like. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. One of the arguments you make in The End of Policing is that police are being asked to do too much. They're basically being tasked with addressing every social problem that we have. So what are police asked to do? And what should they be asked to do? One of the problems that we're encountering here is this massive expansion in the scope of policing over the last 40 years or so. Policing is now happening in our schools. It's happening in relation to the problems of homelessness, untreated mental illness, youth violence and some things that we historically associate police with. But the policing has become more intensive, more invasive, more aggressive. So what I'm calling for is a rethink on why we've turned all of these social problems over to the police to manage. And as we dial those things back, then we can think more concretely about what the rest of policing should look like and how that could be reformed. You brought up homelessness. In many cities police are tasked with dealing with people experiencing homelessness — but they don't have many options besides basically moving people or arresting them. Well, we've created this situation where our political leaders have basically abandoned the possibility of actually housing people. Which, of course, is the real solution, supportive housing for those who need extra support. But basically, we have a massive failure in housing markets that is unable to provide basic shelter for millions of Americans. So instead of actually addressing that fundamental problem, we have relabeled it as a problem that is the fault of the disorderly people who we label as morally deficient. And then we use police to criminalize them, to control their behavior and to reduce their disorderly impact on the rest of us. And this is perverse and unjust. So then it places police in this completely untenable situation, because they completely lack the tools to make this problem any better. And yet we've told them it's their problem to manage. ... Part of our misunderstanding about the nature of policing is we keep imagining that we can turn police into social workers. That we can make them nice, friendly community outreach workers. But police are violence workers. That's what distinguishes them from all other government functions, is that they have the legal capacity to use violence in situations where the average citizen would be arrested. So when we turn a problem over to the police to manage, there will be violence, because those are ultimately the tools that they are most equipped to utilize: handcuffs, threats, guns, arrests. That's what really is at the root of policing. So if we don't want violence, we should try to figure out how to not get the police involved. There are obviously a lot of people who agree broadly with the notion that the way that policing happens in this country is a problem and that there needs to be some sort of change. But they're pretty invested in the idea that police are needed to maintain public safety. People ask the question, without police, what do you do when someone gets murdered? What do you do when someone's house gets robbed? What do you say to those people who have those concerns? Well, I'm certainly not talking about any kind of scenario where tomorrow someone just flips a switch and there are no police. What I'm talking about is the systematic questioning of the specific roles that police currently undertake, and attempting to develop evidence-based alternatives so that we can dial back our reliance on them. And my feeling is that this encompasses actually the vast majority of what police do. We have better alternatives for them. Even if you take something like burglary — a huge amount of burglary activity is driven by drug use. And we need to completely rethink our approach to drugs so that property crime isn't the primary way that people access drugs. We don't have any part of this country that has high quality medical drug treatment on demand. But we have policing on demand everywhere. And it's not working. Obviously, a big part of what is on people's minds right now is the role that police have in dealing with protesters, dealing with different types of political unrest. In your book, you talk a lot about the history of how police have been used to quell social unrest. Can you talk about that history a little bit? Well, I think that one of the myths we have about policing is that it is politically neutral, and that it is always here to sort of create order in a way that benefits everyone. But the reality is that America's social order has never been entirely equitable. We have a long history of exploitation of the indigenous population, of African Americans through slavery, Jim Crow and today. And while we're not using police to manage slavery or colonialism today, we are using police to manage the problems that our very unequal system has produced. We're invested in this kind of austerity politics that says the government can't afford to really do anything to lift people up. We have to put all our resources into subsidizing the already most successful parts of the economy. But those parts of the economy are producing this huge group of people who are homeless, unemployed, have untreated mental health and substance abuse problems. And then we ask the police to put a lid on those problems — to manage them so they don't interfere with the ""order"" that we're supposedly all benefiting from. But if you're one of those poor people, one of those folks with a mental health problem, someone who's involved in black market activities to survive, then you experience this as constant criminalization. And would you say the same goes for people who are political protesters? Political protest has always been a part of this dynamic, right? Political protests are a threat to the order of this system. And so policing has always been the primary tool for managing those threats to the public order. Just as we understand the use of police to deal with homelessness as a political failure, every time we turn a political order problem over to the police to manage, that's also a political failure. I think the mayor of Minneapolis, for instance: Jacob Frey. He has consistently tried to frame this as a problem of a few bad apples. And he says, ""Why are you protesting? We fired them."" But this completely misunderstands the nature of the grievances. And instead of actually addressing those grievances, he's throwing police at the problem. Are the interactions that are happening right now between police and protesters something that you think is predictable? Or is this something new that we haven't seen before? It's not completely new, it's just the intensity of it compared to, let's say, five years ago during the Eric Garner and the Mike Brown protests. What we're seeing is really an immediate escalation to very high levels of force, a high degree of confrontation. And I think part of it is driven by deep frustration within policing, which is that police feel under assault, and they have no answer. They trotted out all the possible solutions: police-community dialogue sessions, implicit bias training, community policing, body cameras. And it just didn't work. It didn't make any difference. And so they ran out of excuses. So the protests today are a much more kind of existential threat to the police. And the police are overreacting as a result. If we were to take serious steps toward moving in the direction of having police address fewer of our social problems and putting those problems in the hands of people who are actually more equipped to deal with them, what would be the next step? What is the next thing that we as a country have to push for? I think this will look like a series of local budget battles. And that's really what's going on across the country, is when we have these divest campaigns in places like Los Angeles and Minneapolis and New York and Durham, North Carolina and Nashville, Tennessee and Dallas, Texas. These are folks who are saying concretely: ""We don't want police in our schools. We want that money spent in ways that help our children, not criminalize them. We don't want more money for overtime for narcotics officers. We want actual drug treatment programs, safe injection facilities, things that will help people."" So that's what this looks like. It's about rallying city council members and mayors around a new vision of creating healthier communities. When you're looking around at what's happening right now, what are the things that you think people need to understand to really process what is going on around the country? Well, I think the police are making the argument for us, right? People started this conversation by saying policing is out of control; they're not making the situation better. They have not been reformed. Well, now all you have to do is turn on the nightly news and see how true that is. The level of aggression and unnecessary escalation is stark evidence of how unreformed policing is, and I argue how unreformable it is. The question is whether or not people will take it to the next step and ask the tough political questions. Why are our mayors turning this over to the police to manage? Why are we using curfews instead of having conversations? Why are we throwing protesters in prison instead of trying to figure out what's driving all of this anger? ",0.0

The pope is urging the U.S. to reach a national reconciliation, after days of protests and violence. ""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,"" the pope said on Wednesday. He added, ""At the same time, we have to recognize that 'the violence of recent nights is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost.'"" Today, Francis says, he is joining the Church in Minneapolis, and across the U.S., ""in praying for the repose of the soul of George Floyd and of all those others who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism."" The prayers, he added, would be for consolation for their grieving families, and for reconciliation and peace. In the pope's remarks about violent protests, he was quoting Archbishop José H. Gomez, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who recently issued a statement condemning Floyd's death. In that statement, Gomez asked, ""How is it possible that in America, a black man's life can be taken from him while calls for help are not answered and his killing is recorded as it happens?"" With riots breaking out in many U.S. cities, Gomez cited America's most famous civil rights leader: ""It is true what Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, that riots are the language of the unheard. We should be doing a lot of listening right now."" The pope's message to the U.S. was part of his address during Wednesday's general audience at the Vatican.

""Dear brothers and sisters in the United States, I have witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest in your nation in these past days, following the tragic death of Mr. George Floyd.
