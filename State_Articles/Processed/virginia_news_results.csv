(AP) — A top official in the Virginia city where a white nationalist rally erupted in violence in 2017 has called for renewing discussions about removing two Confederate statues, one of which became the focus of the rally. In an April email obtained by The Daily Progress, Charlottesville City Manager Tarron Richardson indicated that he wants to hold meetings with the City Council in June to discuss the removal of the statues of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. The newspaper reported that it obtained Richardson’s email through a request under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. Richardson sent the email four days after Gov. Ralph Northam signed bills that give local officials the authority to remove, relocate or alter their Confederate monuments. The legislation takes effect on July 1. After the City Council voted in 2017 to remove the Robert E. Lee statue, white supremacists and other far-right extremists gathered in Charlottesville to protest the decision at what was billed as the “Unite the Right” rally. A night before they clashed with counterprotesters, rally participants carrying torches marched through the University of Virginia’s campus, chanting racist and anti-Semitic slogans. A judge issued a permanent injunction barring removal of the Lee and Jackson statues, which means the city would have to petition the court to lift the injunction before it can take any action, The Daily Progress reports. Richardson wants to hold meetings on the statues’ removal after the council approves its budget for fiscal 2021, which it is expected to do on June 1. City spokesman Brian Wheeler said last week that officials “anticipate being able to engage the community in the process later this summer.” Latest Stories Get breaking news, weather, and sports delivered to your smartphone with the WFXR News app available on Apple and Android.",0.0

(Ronen Zvulun/ Pool Photo via AP) JERUSALEM – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday pledged to annex parts of the occupied West Bank in the coming months, vowing to move ahead with the explosive plan despite a growing chorus of condemnations by key allies. The Palestinians, with wide international backing, seek the entire West Bank as the heartland of a future independent state. Annexing large chunks of this territory would all but destroy the faint remaining hopes of a two-state solution.

Israeli media quoted him as saying he would act in July. “This is an opportunity that we will not let pass,” he told members of his conservative Likud party. He added that the “historic opportunity” to annex the West Bank had never before occurred since Israel's founding in 1948. The comments threatened to push Israel closer to a confrontation with Arab and European partners, and could deepen what is becoming a growing partisan divide over Israel in Washington. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war. It has settled nearly 500,000 Jewish settlers in the territory, but never formally claimed it as an Israeli territory due to stiff international opposition. But the Trump administration has taken a much softer line toward Israeli settlements than its predecessors. Trump's Mideast team is dominated by advisers with close ties to the settlements, and his Mideast plan, unveiled in January, envisions leaving some 30% of the territory under permanent Israeli control while giving the Palestinians expanded autonomy in the rest of the area. The Palestinians have rejected the plan, saying it is unfairly biased toward Israel. With Trump's re-election prospects uncertain this November, Israeli hard-liners have urged Netanyahu to move ahead with annexation quickly. The Israeli leader's new coalition deal includes an official clause allowing him to present his annexation plan to the government in July. Netanyahu told party members in a closed-door meeting that “we have a target date for July and we don’t intend to change it,"" Likud officials said. The plan has already exposed a partisan divide in Washington.

The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said annexation would violate international law and vowed to use “all our diplomatic capacities” to stop it.

In France, the group is facing several lawsuits filed by families who have lost loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic that has caused thousands of deaths in French care homes. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus) PARIS – Employees of a major group of French nursing homes on Monday took part in protests across France to call for better pay amid the coronavirus crisis. Protesters gathered outside homes owned by the Korian group in Paris, Lille and other French cities in response to a call from several far-left unions. The government is formally opening on Monday two months of talks with health care workers over changes to France's public health system, which has suffered from decades of cuts. Korian is one of the market leaders in the provision of care for older adults. It has more than 850 facilities in Europe, employing more than 53,000 people and caring for 300,000 people in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands and Spain. In France, where Korian manages nearly 300 care homes, the group is facing several lawsuits filed by families who have lost loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic. Prosecutors have opened police investigations. France has recorded more than 14,000 COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents, accounting for nearly half of the country’s total of more than 28,300 deaths. Facing anger from health care workers, President Emmanuel Macron promised a “massive” investment plan for France’s public health sector. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe acknowledged there had been “a lot of criticism” over how the government had prepared French hospitals in the years leading up to the coronavirus pandemic, as he launched initial talks to prepare the new health plans on Monday. Philippe pledged that health workers would see a “significant” salary raise rise in what he promised to be a “radical” review of the French health care system. Further details will be unveiled in July. Philippe said coronavirus had made it clear a “change of pace” was needed with regard to the system. The government said that all staff working in public hospitals and nursing homes in the regions hardest hit by the virus will get a 1,500-euro ($1,632) bonus from the state. Doctors and nurses have long denounced low salaries, staffing shortages and overwhelmed services in hospitals. Before the virus crisis, emergency room workers held strikes and protests for months demanding more hiring and funding. ___ Follow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",0.0

Cobb, a percussionist and the last surviving member of Miles Davis' 1959 ""Kind of Blue"" groundbreaking jazz album which transformed the genre and sparked several careers, died Sunday, May 24, 2020, at his New York's Manhattan home. He was 91. (Courtesy of Smoke Sessions Records via AP) Jimmy Cobb, a percussionist and the last surviving member of Miles Davis’ 1959 “Kind of Blue” groundbreaking jazz album which transformed the genre and sparked several careers, died Sunday. His wife, Eleana Tee Cobb, announced on Facebook that her husband died at his New York City home from lung cancer. He was 91. Born in Washington, D.C., Cobb told The Associated Press in 2019 he listened to jazz albums and stayed up late to hear disc jockey Symphony Sid playing jazz in New York City before launching his professional career. He said it was saxophonist Cannonball Adderley who recommended him to Davis, and he ended up playing on several Davis recordings. But Cobb’s role as a drummer on the “Kind of Blue” jam session headed by Davis would forever change his career. That album also featured Adderley and John Coltrane. The album, released on Aug. 17, 1959, captured a moment when jazz was transforming from bebop to something newer, cooler and less structured. The full takes of the songs were recorded only once, with one exception, Cobb said. “Freddie Freeloader” needed to be played twice because Davis didn’t like a chord change on the first attempt, he said. Davis, who died in 1991, had some notes jotted down, but there weren’t pages of sheet music. It was up to the improvisers to fill the pages. “He’d say this is a ballad. I want it to sound like it’s floating. And I’d say, ‘OK,’ and that’s what it was,” Cobb recalled. The album received plenty of acclaim at the time, yet the critics, the band and the studio couldn’t have known it would enjoy such longevity. He and his bandmates knew the album would be a hit but didn’t realize at the time how iconic it would become. “We knew it was pretty damned good,” Cobb joked. It has sold more than 4 million copies and remains the best selling jazz album of all time. It also served as a protest album for African American men who looked to Davis and the jazz musicians to break stereotypes about jazz and black humanity. Cobb would also work with such artists as Dinah Washington, Pearl Bailey, Clark Terry, Dizzy Gillespie, Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, Wynton Kelly and Stan Getz. He'd also release a number of albums on his own. He performed well into his late 80s and played in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 2017, as part of the New Mexico Jazz Festival. Jazz fans from throughout the American Southwest came to pay their respects in what many felt was a goodbye. Cobb released his last album, This I Dig of You, with Smoke Sessions Records in August 2019. ___ This story has been corrected to show the accurate spelling of Miles Davis. ___ Associated Press writer David Sharp contributed to this piece from Portland, Maine. ___ Contreras reported from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

1616602127,2020-05-26 00:29:05,"‘ReOpen Manassas’ rally highlights residents’ lockdown frustrations, tensions in county government",https://potomaclocal.com/2020/05/26/reopen-manassas-rally-highlights-residents-lockdown-frustrations-tensions-in-county-government/,en,False,,211997,potomaclocal.com,http://potomaclocal.com/,"On Saturday, over 100 people came together in front of the old Manassas Courthouse to peacefully protest Governor Ralph Northam’s stay-at-home orders. Small business owners, elected officials, candidates seeking elected office, pastors, and community activists all spoke and called for the coronavirus restrictions — now largely affecting only Northern Virginia — to be lifted. U.S. flags, political signs, and stickers could be seen all around the courthouse grounds as the protesters clapped and cheered. The protest was organized by two Prince William County residents Christopher Lee and Zack McDonald. Lee, an engineer, and McDonald, a physical therapist organized the rally to engage people on the governor’s stay-at-home order, extended in Prince William County and Manassas until at least Friday, May 29. Both say the government has overstepped its role by issuing orders that prevented small “nonessential” businesses from opening and church congregations from holding regular meetings. McDonald said he hoped this protest will open the eyes of civil magistrates, and get them to trust Virginians to practice safe social-distancing measures in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, and allow business owners to reopen, to provide for their customers and their families. McDonald used Facebook to organize the event, netting the attention of those who spoke at the event, to include former Prince William County Delegate Rich Anderson, Brentsville Supervisor Jeanine Lawson, Republican Senate candidate Tom Speciale, Prince William Republican chair candidate Tim Parrish, 10th Congressional District candidates Alicia Andrews and Jeff Dove, as well as a conservative activist and blogger Greg Letiecq. Chris Concannon, of Warrenton and an organizer for the recently held “ReOpen Fauquier County” rally, stood and read aloud the text of Northam’s Executive Order 55, signed on March 30, initially requiring Virginians to stay at home until at least June 30. Protesters resist the mask When he read the section that orders people “must at all times maintain social distancing of at least six feet from any other person unless they live in the same household,” Concannon quipped, “look at us now! Let’s just call ourselves one big family.” Concannon went on to state that the restrictions had “flushed the economy down the toilet.” More than 560,000 Virginians filed for unemployment since the pandemic began in March, according to the state unemployment commission. More than 400,000 state residents continued to claim unemployment insurance as of May 16. Most of them once worked in restaurants and hotels, all of which have hit hard by the state-imposed economic shutdown. Former Prince William County Delegate Rich Anderson encouraged the crowd to defend their rights. Anderson served in the General Assembly in Richmond from 2010-2017 and lost his seat to current Delegate Hala Ayala (D-51). “The governor has grabbed power that is not granted to him by the Constitution,” Anderson said referring to the lockdown orders. When Anderson brought up the possibility of facemasks being required for all Virginians, many members of the crowd shouted “no!” “I took an oath while serving in the military to defend against domestic threats. It’s time to protect against domestic threats,” said Anderson in closing. Last week, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam hinted that during a press conference today, he would order all Virginians to wear face masks. If he does, the order would come after the CDC now recommends wearing a cloth facemask after it found a large number of people who have contracted the new coronavirus lack symptoms (are asymptomatic) can still transmit the virus to others through speaking, coughing, or sneezing. Northam’s order would also come after he made an appearance on the Virginia Beach oceanfront Saturday afternoon without a mask, posing for selfies with beachgoers. The Manassas rally also served a campaign stump speech for Anderson, who is now one of three candidates running to become the head of the Republican Party of Virginia. Tim Parrish, a Woodbridge resident who seeks to lead the Prince William GOP, urged elected officials to let the businesses that can open safely do so. Parrish spoke about how people of all backgrounds are “hurting,” and called out elected officials directly. “While [elected officials] tell us to stay home, you collect paychecks from our tax dollars,” said Parrish. Protesters held homemade signs with statements that read, “what will you do without freedom,” “stop tyranny,” and “my father feeding me is essential.” Several families were in attendance with children holding up signs, too. Prince William Sheriff’s deputies monitored the event on the grounds of the courthouse. Cases increase, hospitalizations decline The rally comes as Northam declined requests from the Prince William Board of County Supervisors and the Manassas City Council to allow restaurants to reopen in time for the Memorial Day weekend, with outdoor seating, at 50% of a restaurant’s normal seating capacity. In the past week, coronavirus testing has been ramped up in Prince William County with the county government, and the Manassas City Government, offering free tests at multiple locations. The Northern Virginia region now leads the nation in new coronavirus cases in the wake of increased testing. A total of 94 people in Prince William County have died from coronavirus. There have been nine deaths in Manassas and five in Manassas Park. There have been a combined 5,812 reported cases of coronavirus in all three jurisdictions. At 1,376 on Memorial Day, the number of Virginians hospitalized for coronavirus is at its lowest since April 23. Of the 2,954 ventilators available in hospitals throughout the state, 611 were in use on Memorial Day, equalling 21% of all ventilators. Tensions among Prince William leaders on the rise A reporter’s email to a group of Prince William County leaders, to include Prince William Board of County Supervisors Chair At-large Ann Wheeler, sent on Thursday, May 21, sparked a series of events that had several high-ranking officials claiming Wheeler wanted to put a stop to the rally before it began. The email from the Prince William Times stated Prince William County Sheriff Glendell Hill granted permission for the rally to take place on the grounds of the courthouse, asserting the sheriff had issued permits for the event. In fact, no permits were issued to the group, rally organizer Chris Lee told Potomac Local News. Rather, Lee and his fellow organizers had briefed Hill and his staff on Thursday, May 21, as a courtesy, about their plans to rally at the courthouse. The land is a publicly-owned space and no such permit is required for protesters to gather. After reading the email, Wheeler told Potomac Local News she called Hill to ask if, in fact, he issued any permits for the rally. He hadn’t. Similarly, no permits were issued when a similar rally to keep the 287(g) program took place outside the Prince William County Government Center on Tuesday, May 19. The next morning, Lee was interviewed on the morning show on WMAL Radio in Washington, D.C. about the upcoming rally. Wheeler told Potomac Local News she heard the interview and heard what sounded like Lee characterizing Sheriff Hill as a supporter of the rally. Afterward, she dialed the sheriff’s office again and asked Hill if, in fact, he supported the rally. Hill declined to comment for this story, however, multiple sources told Potomac Local News that the independently-elected sheriff declined to respond to her, and told Wheeler, “I work for the people, not for you.” Lee told Potomac Local News that a sheriff’s deputy called him the shortly after the interview to ask him if he told the radio the hosts that Hill was a rally supporter. Lee followed up that call with an email to county officials. “Capt. Hardeman contacted me earlier today regarding a radio interview that I conducted with WMAL at [8:15 a.m.] regarding the ‘ReOpen Rally’ that will be held tomorrow. He mentioned to me that some of you supervisors (or your staff) had called him and were agitated at what you thought I said regarding the [Prince William County] Sheriff staff. Specifically, Capt. Hardemen asked me whether or not I said in the interview that the [Prince William County] Sheriff sheriff’s office supported our rally. Consistent with my discussion with the sheriff and his staff yesterday, where he was clear to support our right to protest and right to free speech, but not the rally or its message, specifically. From the tone of that meeting, I NEVER said in the interview that the [Prince Willima County] sheriff supported our rally.” As Friday wore on, the halls of local government became ever more abuzz about the upcoming rally. A 1 p.m., Prince William County Executive Christopher Martino sent a group email to county officials notifying them of the upcoming rally, confirming that, despite the reporter’s email assertion the day before, rally organizers didn’t need permits. About a half-hour later, Brentsville District Supervisor Jeanine Lawson sent an email to Martino that stated: “I’m very bothered to hear from Sheriff Hill this morning that Ann put you up to calling him and suggesting people be arrested at the rally tomorrow. Had I or another board member called you with same request, I certainly hope you would have declined to make the call. Further, a call like that should have been a directive by the Board, not just the Chair.” Wheeler told Potomac Local News that at no time did she ask anyone to be arrested at Saturday’s rally in Manassas, nor did she ask the police to arrest anyone at the May 19 rally outside the county government center. Both rallies took place despite the fact that Northern Virginia, including Prince William County and Manassas, continues to be under Northam’s stay-at-home orders. Wheeler was one of multiple Northern Virginia leaders to ask to leave Northern Virginia out of a majority of cities, towns, and counties that reopened, entering the first phase of the governor’s reopening plan. At her request announced on May 10, nonessential businesses were to remain closed and residents continue under Northan’s stay-at-home order. A Board of County Supervisors divided The exchange comes at a time when the Prince William Board of County Supervisors is seemingly unable to compromise. Democrats control the Board with a majority 5-3 vote, and they appointed 14 people to various lower boards and commissions during the Board of County Supervisors’ meeting on Tuesday, May 19. One of those controversial appointments was to the county’s jail board was Virginia Delegate Elizabeth Guzman (D-31, Dale City, Fauquier), and it came with fierce opposition from Republicans on the Board of County Supervisors. Guzman has vowed to end the county’s 287(g) program which trains local jail employees to check the immigration status of those charged with a crime. It’s the same program that last week identified 35-year-old Walner Alberto Pichinte Echeverria, of Frederick, Md., of being in the U.S. illegally. He is charged with felony hit and run in the death of 62-year-0ld Alberto Anthony Marino, of Bristow, who was struck by two cars while crossing Sudley Road on May 6. Police are still searching for the second vehicle that struck Marino. Hill spent more than an hour at that Board of County Supervisors meeting, prior to its appointment of Guzman, addressing supervisors about the jail board, of which he serves as chairman, by law. He begged supervisors not to “politicize” the jail board by making an appointment based on a controversial issue like immigration. Prince William County Police Chief Barry Barnard is set to retire at the end of the month. He’s a member of the jail board and would be replaced on the board in the interim by Deputy Chief of Police Jarad Phelps. However, Phelps is expected to interview for the top cop job, and any action he could take on the jail board as it relates to the 287(g) program could affect whether or not he gets the job. In the final hours of the marathon 12-hour meeting, Lawson motioned that, instead of Phelps, Republican Supervisor Yesli Vega — a former Alexandria police officer, a reserve Prince William County Sheriff’s Deputy, and the first Latina to be elected to the Prince William Board of County Supervisors — be appointed to the jail board until a new police chief is hired to replace Vega on the board. Woodbridge District Supervisor Margaret Franklin blocked that move and, in a substitute motion, nominated fellow Democrat and Occoquan District Supervisor Kenny Boddye to the jail board, citing his work with the NAACP and his work with local law enforcement as his qualifications to be considered for appointment to the jail board. Eventually, both Lawson and Franklin rescinded their motions and the meeting adjourned. The Board of County Supervisors is set to meet again on June 2.

Some 250,000 registered migrant laborers in Lebanon maids, garbage collectors, farm hands and construction workers are growing more desperate as a crippling economic and financial crisis sets in, coupled with coronavirus restrictions. With no functioning airports and exorbitant costs of repatriation flights, many are trapped, unable to go home. (AP Photo/Hussein Malla) BEIRUT – Long before the pandemic struck, they lived and worked in conditions that rights groups called exploitative — low wages, long hours, no labor law protections. Now, some 250,000 registered migrant laborers in Lebanon — maids, garbage collectors, farm hands and construction workers — are growing more desperate as a crippling economic and financial crisis sets in, coupled with coronavirus restrictions. Lebanon’s unprecedented foreign currency crisis means that many migrants have not been paid for months or that the value of salaries is down by more than half. Others have lost their jobs after employers dumped them on the streets or outside their embassies. “We are invisible,” said Banchi Yimer, an Ethiopian former domestic worker who founded a group that campaigns for domestic workers' rights in Lebanon. “We don’t even exist for our governments, not just the Lebanese government.” In just three days, she said, 20 Ethiopian domestic workers were abandoned by their sponsors and left outside the embassy. A photo she posted shows women with as little as a backpack or a purse, lined up along the walls of the embassy — some sitting on the floor. The pandemic delivered just the latest blow to a Lebanese economy, already devastated by a financial crisis brought on by decades of corruption and mismanagement. In recent weeks, the Lebanese pound, pegged to the dollar for more than two decades, has lost 60% of its value against the dollar and prices of basic goods soared. Unemployment has risen to 35% and an estimated 45% of the country’s population is now below the poverty line. In this crisis, migrant workers are among the most vulnerable. Among them are 180,000 domestic workers, most of them women and many from Ethiopia and the Philippines. Thousands live illegally, after escaping their employers to whom they were tied under an ill-reputed sponsorship system, known in Arabic as ‘kafala,’ which dates back to the 1960s. Many are trapped, unable to go home, because they cannot afford the exorbitant costs of repatriation flights or because global air travel is severely restricted. Their plight is similar to that of migrant workers in other countries, including foreign laborers in oil-rich Gulf Arab states who now find themselves jobless, as COVID-19 stalks their labor camps. In the Lebanese capital of Beirut, the financial chaos has added to their despair. On Saturday, a Filipina domestic worker took her own life a day after arriving at a shelter run by the Philippines Embassy for workers waiting to return home after losing their jobs. In a statement Monday, the embassy said she died after jumping from a room she was sharing with two others. Both the Philippines Embassy and Lebanese authorities said they were investigating the death. Suspected suicides or escape attempts of foreign household workers have become a frequent occurrence in Lebanon, with local reports recording at least one incident a month. Such desperate acts are often blamed on the sponsorship system, which rights groups say creates near slave-like conditions. Some employers do not allow their helpers to go out on the street alone or have a day off. Domestic workers are not protected by labor law and are often shackled in a 24-7 work schedule with no right to resign. “Some of their employers abuse them mentally physically and there is no law to protect them. Their employers ... treat them like slaves,” said Tsigereda Brihanu, an Ethiopian activist with Egna Legna, Yimer’s organization. A 2016 International Labor Organization study found that out of 1,200 employers surveyed, more than 94% withheld their workers’ passports. Last week, security forces violently quelled a protest by Bangladeshi sanitation workers who were demanding an adjustment of their salaries to new market rates. The pandemic has also taken its toll. A few dozen foreign workers living in overcrowded apartments in Beirut have tested positive for the coronavirus. Riot police are often deployed outside their buildings to enforce isolation. Last week, Ethiopian workers staged a symbolic demonstration outside their embassy to demand free repatriation. “We don’t have the power to bring a plane and to take out everybody from this country. I wish we can do that,” Brihanu said. “Regular life in Lebanon is very difficult even to survive. It is not worth it to stay here.” One Ethiopian worker said that even though her sponsor still pays her salary, she is already checking into going home because she knows the dollars will run out and prices will continue to increase. “Lebanon's finished,” she said, declining to give her name in order to speak freely. The virus lockdown has exacerbated work conditions. Some workers are not able to communicate with their own families and friends, the hours are much longer and the demands by employers are unrealistic, said Zeina Mezher of the International Labor Organization. “They say that we are all in the storm, but it doesn’t affect us all in the same way,” she said. Yimer, who founded Egna Legna in 2017, is now in Canada, where the group is registered as a non-profit organization, because it is illegal for domestic workers to be activists in Lebanon, and the government has refused to register a union for them. Egna Legna, meaning “from us migrants to us migrants” in Amharic, Ethiopia's official language, now offers food packages for some who lost their jobs and helps others pay rent. “I have not worked for nearly three months,” said Kumari, a household worker from Sri Lanka. Kumari used to hold down work in several homes in order to send money to her 5-year-old daughter who is being raised by her mother back home. “Nobody has work. I want to go home but I can't until corona finishes,” she said.",0.0

1617216454,2020-05-26 12:58:31,Man dies after video shows Minneapolis police officer kneeling on his neck,https://www.wavy.com/news/national/man-dies-after-video-shows-minneapolis-police-officer-kneeling-on-his-neck/,en,True,,70270,wavy.com,http://www.wavy.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Four Minneapolis officers involved in the arrest of a black man who died in police custody were fired Tuesday, hours after a bystander’s video showed an officer kneeling on the handcuffed man’s neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving. Mayor Jacob Frey announced the firings on Twitter, saying “This is the right call.” The man’s death Monday night was under investigation by the FBI and state law enforcement authorities. It immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. In a post on his Facebook page, Frey apologized Tuesday to the black community for the officer’s treatment of the man, who was later identified as 46-year-old George Floyd, who worked security at a restaurant. “Being Black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a Black man’s neck. Five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you’re supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense,” Frey posted. Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest. The video starts with the shirtless man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement. Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” The man calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts … I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.” But Floyd stops talking and slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics. Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said. At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?” The Hennepin County medical examiner identified Floyd but said the cause of death was pending. Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.” Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights and personal injury attorney, said he had been hired by Floyd’s family. He called firing the officers “a good first step on the road to justice” for Floyd but said the city must “fix the policies and training deficiencies that permitted this unlawful killing to occur.” Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the department would conduct a full internal investigation. Police did not identify the officers, but attorney Tom Kelly confirmed he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd’s neck. Kelly declined to comment further. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. News accounts show he was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, whom police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 in a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Protesters filled the intersection Tuesday evening in the street where Floyd died, chanting and carrying banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” They eventually marched about 2 1/2 miles to a city police precinct, with some protesters damaging windows, a squad car and spraying graffiti on the building. A line of police in riot gear eventually confronted the protesters, firing tear gas and projectiles. Some protesters kicked canisters back toward police. Some protesters stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station, and though steady rain diminished the crowd, tense skirmishes stretched late into the evening. Experts on police use of force told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long. They noted the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.” “He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.” The New York City officer in the Garner case said he was using a legal maneuver called “the seatbelt” to bring down Garner, whom police said had been resisting arrest. But the medical examiner referred to it as a chokehold in the autopsy report and said it contributed to his death. Chokehold maneuvers are banned under New York police policy. A grand jury later decided against indicting the officers involved in Garner’s death, sparking protests around the country. The New York Police Department ultimately fired the officer who restrained Garner, but it was five years later, after a federal investigation, a city prosecutor’s investigation and an internal misconduct trial. In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook. A chokehold is considered a deadly force option and involves someone obstructing the airway. According to the department’s use-of-force policy, officers are to use only an amount of force necessary that would be objectively reasonable. Before the officers were fired, the police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which would handle any prosecution of police on state criminal charges, said in a statement that it was “shocked and saddened” by the video and pledged to handle the case fairly. The FBI is investigating whether the officers willfully deprived Floyd of his rights. If those federal civil rights charges are brought, they would be handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Minnesota, which declined comment. The death came amid outrage over the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was fatally shot Feb. 23 in Georgia after a white father and son pursued the 25-year-old black man they had spotted running in their subdivision. More than two months passed before charges were brought. Crump also represents Arbery’s father. ___ Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, contributed to this report.",0.0

Northam addressing Virginia, expected to issue an order for masks in some places",https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Gov-Northam-addressing-Virginia-expected-to-issue-an-order-for-masks-in-some-areas-570773261.html,en,False,,80667,whsv.com,http://www.whsv.com/#spider,"Note: This article appears extremely long. That's because it includes previous updates from Gov. Northam's briefings throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, if you would like to compare statements or consider the commonwealth's overall timeline of response. The latest updates always come just below our introduction that overviews the current situation in Virginia. Headers indicate the date of each update, and you can search for updates from any past briefings by searching the date, like ""May 11"" (all briefings have been on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays). Governor Ralph Northam addressed the commonwealth on Tuesday for his latest COVID-19 briefing as Virginia approaches the two-week minimum time period he set for Phase 1 of his 'Forward Virginia' plan for reopening. After Memorial Day, from here on, the governor has said his COVID-19 briefings will be twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays instead of three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. On Friday, Gov. Northam announced a new online COVID-19 symptom checker through the health department, talked statewide testing efforts, unemployment, and more. But he very specifically told Virginians that he was planning to issue new guidance on face coverings on Tuesday. Giving the commonwealth what he called ""homework"" for the weekend, he encouraged everyone to find face coverings for their family by Tuesday and prepare to wear them into public places of business. But he'll go into more detail in Tuesday's briefing. Northam himself faced heavy criticism this past weekend after visiting Virginia Beach without wearing a mask. The governor also suggested last Friday that he would have more details on Tuesday about when northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County, which each requested 2-week delays to Phase 1, will be able to join the rest of the state in Phase 1, as well as possibly an update on timing for the commonwealth entering Phase 2. You can find detailed breakdowns of previous press conferences farther down on this page, under the headers for their respective dates. Most of Virginia began Phase 1 on May 15, except for Northern Virginia, which received a 2-week extension to Phase 0 a few days before the start, and Richmond and Accomack County, which each requested and received similar 2-week extensions just hours before the official start of Phase 1. According to the governor, Phase 1 will last at least two weeks, and how data trends on Virginia's COVID-19 tests, hospital bed capacity, and PPE supplies will determine when the commonwealth can move to Phase 2. At this point, no date has been set for Phase 2 and no date has been set for when Northam will announce a date for Phase 2. As of Monday morning's latest COVID-19 numbers for Virginia, testing remains generally higher across Virginia and the 'percent positivity' rate of how many Virginians are testing positive for COVID-19 has been steadily decreasing over time, though Monday itself saw a spike in the daily percent positivity. Northam has said that the restrictions in Phase 1 established by his administration are ""the floor"" and that it's up to individual businesses whether they are able to safely reopen and individual regions can request changes if their data is different from the state's overall. As of May 26, Virginia has 39,342 total cases of COVID-19, including confirmed lab tests and clinical diagnoses, with 1,236 total deaths and 4,325 cumulative hospitalizations. According to the Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association, there are currently 1,403 Virginians hospitalized with either confirmed COVID-19 tests or pending COVID-19 test results and 5,227 patients who were hospitalized and have recovered. In general, over the past three weeks, test results have yielded lower daily case totals and increased testing, showing the ""curve"" of Virginia cases moving downward. But the commonwealth is still working to overcome an earlier backlog in testing and catch up to the national average of how much of the population has been tested, although state health officials say their focus is getting tests to the most vulnerable and most affected people. You can watch each of the governor's briefings through WHSV's livestream at whsv.com/livestream2 or on the WHSV News app. That livestream can also be watched through our Roku and Amazon Fire apps. You'll also be able to watch it live in the video player above during the briefing. The latest updates from Gov. Northam's May 26 briefing Addressing criticism for his mask-less Virginia Beach visit Governor Ralph Northam started Tuesday's briefing by directly addressing the criticism he received after photos showed him not wearing a mask during a visit to Virginia Beach over the weekend. Northam emphasized that Virginia Beach was only allowed to open after the city's reopening plan was approved by the state government to keep visitors as safe as possible amid the pandemic. He said he was at Virginia Beach to thank the mayor and city leaders for their work on that effort, thank first responders in the city, and thank ambasadors in the area, all while in open air along the beach with social distancing in each meeting. According to the governor, he was not planning to interact with members of the public while he was there. His account of the situation when pictures were taken is that he was headed down the Virginia Beach boardwalk to talk to members of the press when who he described as ""well-wishers"" approached him and wanted to take a photo. Northam claimed he was not prepared for that, and had left his mask in his car, but wanted to accommodate the people's request for a photo because he tries to not turn down to requests for photos. He thanked the people who he said held him accountable for his action of not wearing a mask and said he takes full full responsibility for not being prepared, and will work to be better prepared whenever he is out in the public again. Saying that he, like everyone, is forming new habits and routines to adjust to the new normal of COVID-19, he emphasized that it was his responsibility. Virginia Beach's reopening Following up his apology and explanation, the governor said Virginia Beach did well with reopening over the weekend, without large gatherings and with people social distancing and following the rules on the beach. Northam said he hopes Virginia Beach can be a model for other beaches across the country planning to reopen safely. Plans for other beaches Specifically, Northam said Virginia Beach's plan will be a benchmark for the state to consider proposed plans from Norfolk, Hampton, and other beaches along Virginia's coast that hope to open up this coming weekend. The governor said if their plans work like Virginia Beach's, those plans will be approved in the coming days. The latest data trends Gov. Northam very briefly recapped the latest case trends in Virginia, pointing to overall declines in percent positivity and hospitalizations across the commonwealth, alongside testing capacity trending upward and steady PPE supply numbers. He said that data supports assessments made by his state's team and by health district directors across Virginia, including in Northern Virginia. The future for areas still in Phase 0 Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County all remain in Phase 0 of Virginia's reopening plan, not yet in Phase 1, which the rest of Virginia entered on May 15. Local government leaders in Northern Virginia sent a formal letter to state health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver on Sunday, writing that the area has met most of the necessary data metrics to move into Phase 1, including two weeks of downward trends in cases. Accomack County leaders also indicated a readiness to move forward. In Richmond, Mayor Levar Stoney followed a different path, asking for the city to move into a modified Phase 1 that remains more restrictive. Northam said more information will be released by his office on Wednesday, while they remain in communication with Richmond's mayor, on guidelines for when each area will be able to move forward. However, he did confirm that the plan is for the areas to move into Phase 1 on Friday. For Richmond specifically, he said he received Mayor Stoney's letter Tuesday morning and is in discussion with the mayor and Richmond officials to figure out all the moving parts with their specific request. What about Phase 2 for the rest of Virginia? Gov. Northam, asked when he'll be able to say when most of Virginia can enter Phase 2, did not provide any specifics. He said the incubation period COVID-19 is around two weeks, which makes moving forward two weeks after the start of Phase 1 difficult, since the data won't be there yet for many cases contracted since Phase 1 began. Northam said his team will determine a data for Phase 2 as soon as they can, but Phase 1 will continue through at least this Friday. Essentially, he said the health department doesn't have the data yet to make a safe decision on Phase 2 timing, although the two-week minimum was a time period he initially announced. As Phase 1 continues, Northam reminded Virginians that it loosens restrictions but does not require business to reopen. Saying that ""just because you can open doesn't mean you have to open,"" he encouraged business owners to do what they feel is right for their workers and customers and encouraged local governments to communicate with business owners about the guidelines for safe operation. A mask order While Virginia remains in Phase 1, Gov. Northam said one major change will come this Friday. Effective Friday, May 29, Northam announced that people will need to wear face coverings inside public places of businesses. That order is taking effect through Executive Order 63. The new mask order applies to everyone 10 and over and requires wearing a face covering while "" entering, exiting, traveling through, and spending time in"" the following establishments: • All essential and non-essential brick and mortar retail establishments, including grocery stores and pharmacies • All personal care and grooming establishments • Inside food and beverage establishments (The text of the executive order specifies ""restaurants, dining establishments, food courts, breweries, microbreweries, distilleries, wineries, tasting rooms, and farmers markets, when permitted to reopen for indoor dining"") • On public transportation, including train stations, bus stations, and on intrastate public transportation, including in waiting or congregating areas • Entertainment or public amusement establishments when they're allowed to open in a later phase • State and local government buildings and areas where the public accesses government services • Inside any indoor space shared by groups of people who may congregate within six feet of one another or who are in close proximity to each other for more than ten minutes Exceptions are provided for the following situations: • Exercising • While eating or drinking • If you have trouble breathing or are unable to remove a mask without help • If health conditions prohibit wearing a face covering • Young children The governor strongly encouraged any child 3 years old and older wear a face covering if possible, but it's only required for children over the age of 10. Northam's office also issued a reminder that face coverings do not take the place of public health guidelines to maintain six feet of physical distancing, increase cleaning and sanitation, and wash hands regularly. Why? Gov. Northam said the reason for the face covering order is because protecting the people around us means face coverings. As research has continued into COVID-19, more and more health professionals have agreed that face coverings are critical to continuing daily operations around the country. ""I wear a mask to protect you, you wear a mask to protect me,"" said Dr. Norm Oliver, encapsulating the basic logic behind wearing face coverings, which help prevent droplets from yourself that could potentially infect others if you don't know you're symptomatic. What constitutes a face covering? Under Executive Order 63, a face covering includes anything that covers your nose and mouth, such as a mask, scarf, or bandana. Medical-grade masks and personal protective equipment should be reserved for health care professionals, Northam said. Getting a mask The governor said face coverings do not need to be medical grade and highly recommended many websites that have instructions on how to create your own face masks with materials at home, as well options like bandannas. He also encouraged any groups that can help provide face coverings to people who don't have them to please do that. How will the order be enforced? Governor Northam said the mask order is a ""matter of public health"" and not a criminal matter, so any enforcement of the new mask order will be done by health officials rather than law enforcement officials. The governor said his goal is to protect people's health and not to get people in trouble for not wearing masks, saying he's simply asking people to respect one another. However, pressed by reporters about how the order can be enforced, he said his office looked into the possibility of criminal enforcement and determined that violations could only be charged as a class 1 misdemeanor, which can come with large fines or even jail time, and he said that's not what he wanted. The governor's office is expecting the General Assembly to discuss the possibility of a civil fine for violations when they re-convene for a special session at some point in the next two months, but nothing is happening on that front at this point. So what does enforcement through the health department actually look like? The governor was very light on details when asked about that. Essentially, he said people would need to contact the Virginia Department of Health about any businesses that are not complying with the order. He said the legality of enforcement ""can get complicated in a hurry"" but simply said it will be enforced by the Virginia Department of Health. Clark Mercer, Northam's chief of staff, went into a little more detail, though. He said health officials would simply issue warnings to individuals not wearing masks, but their focus will be on businesses that are ""grossly negligent"" in enforcing the mask order. In the case of a business not following the mask order, the Virginia Department of Health and the Department of Labor and Industry can be contacted and can each take action against businesses, pulling the operating license of businesses that repeatedly refuse to comply with mask order. On Wednesday, WHSV reached out to the Virginia Department of Health, who issued this statement about how they can enforce the order: VDH has the power to enforce egregious patron/customer violations through a court order, which is punishable by a Class One misdemeanor. Many businesses also have face covering requirements for their employees as outlined in Phase One restrictions (restaurants, salons, etc.), which are enforced by the health department and the relevant regulatory agency. We are not looking to put anyone in jail—we are focused on education, and we hope and expect that Virginians will do the right thing. When can the mask order be lifted? Asked when the mask order will be able to be lifted, Northam said the problem with any timelines looking into the future is that COVID-19 is a novel virus, with more constantly being learned and the situation constantly developing. He said the order will be lifted as soon as it's safe to do so, but the focus is largely on protecting workers, and there is no exact timeline. Will face coverings be required in schools? Governor Northam has said repeatedly in briefings that he hopes to have schools reopen in the fall. Asked if the state may require face coverings for students when schools do reopen, the governor said his team is considering the possibility, but will have to see what the virus does in the coming months before fall comes. A decision will be made on potential face covering requirements by fall. Protecting workers Gov. Northam said the face covering order is especially designed to protect workers who are put in vulnerable populations by interacting with customers who come into businesses not wearing masks as more businesses reopen and more people venture out. Republican response House Republican Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, House Republican Caucus Chair Kathy Byron, R-Bedford, and House Republican Whip Jay Leftwich, R-Chesapeake issued the following statement in response to the governor's order: “We are deeply concerned about Governor Northam’s actions today. It is unconscionable to require businesses to enforce a government mandate under threat of sanction from government agencies. This puts yet another burden on businesses already reeling from months of being shut down or severely limited."" “Throughout this episode, the Governor has acted inconsistently. Through his own actions the Governor has squandered his capital as a physician whose advice people would be willing to follow. Virginians would be much more likely to follow the suggestions of a leader who instills confidence and leads with consistency.” New workplace regulations With worker safety in mind, Gov. Northam said Virginia's Department of Labor and Industry is working to draft new regulations on workplace safety standards amid the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring employers to have set guidelines for controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19 through specific measures for their workplace, including how to enforce social distancing and providing PPE for workers. These occupational safety standards will require the approval by vote of the Virginia Safety and Health Codes Board and must address personal protective equipment, sanitation, record-keeping of incidents, and hazard communication. Upon approval, the Department of Labor and Industry will be able to enforce the standards through civil penalties and business closures. Northam's optimism Governor Northam said he's optimistic for the future with the mask order in place, because he said he's seen Virginians doing the right things to control the virus' spread. But he asked Virginians to all remember the golden rule and keep looking out for each other. ""The future will not look like the past,"" he said, at least for a while, but he said Virginians have stepped up in the best ways. PPE and contact tracing Governor Northam said it's essential that all of Virginia has access to the necessary personal protective equipment and that the Virginia Department of Emergency Management has been working with agencies to provide all materials necessary to health care workers and first responders. He acknowledged that there's always more work to done, and also highlighted the continuing work of the Virginia Department of Health to hire 1,200 contact tracers, saying they may starting more if needed, but the process is moving forward. Monday's data surge Health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver was asked about the large number of cases and tests reported on Monday, which the health department announced later in the day was due to maintenance on their technical system that had prevented the release of most numbers on Sunday. Dr. Oliver told a reporter that he didn't see it as a discrepancy in the data, but just an update with two days worth of data. He said their servers were improved with new memory and storage, but while the servers were down for that upgrade, no new reports from local health districts could be processed into the dashboard. Is the governor getting tested? Gov. Northam said he has not been tested for COVID-19 yet in the pandemic, but that he looks forward to going to a community testing site in the near future to demonstrate how easy the test is and encourage more Virginians to get tested. Reporting recovery data? Asked once again about the possibility of reporting recovery information about Virginia's COVID-19 cases, health officials pointed Virginians to the VHHA website, which tracks the latest number of hospitalized patients who have since been discharged. A lack of demographic data A number of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Virginia still do not have demographic data available to the public. Health commissioner Dr. Oliver said that is tied to the clinician who places any particular COVID-19 test, because the health department gets their data from the labs. Dr. Oliver said they've worked to educate clinicians around Virginia on encouraging including race and ethnicity data when making lab orders for tests, and said they've seen great improvement, especially after the state was initially missing the data on more than half of cases early in Virginia's response. He also pointed to the Health Equity Work Group, which is looking at ways to look at the data and understand exactly how communities of color have been impacted. Protections for workers For employees who have returned to work or who are returning to work but don't feel comfortable in their workplace, Megan Healy, Gov. Ralph Northam’s chief workforce development adviser, said the current practice for Virginia is for the employee to try working directly with their employer to improve conditions. If that does not work, employees are encouraged to file a complaint with OSHA, which then passes the complaint on to Virginia DOLI. DOLI is also the department that Northam announced on Tuesday is implementing emergency temporary standards for all Virginia workplaces. However, Healy said those standards will have to be approved by health code boards, which she said should meet ""soon"" to consider codifying the new standards. Help for areas with higher death rates Dr. Laurie Forlano said Virginia's Health Equity Work Group is using software to track the communities at highest risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths based on the prevalence of chronic conditions, employment rates, poverty, and other factors, using that information to target prevention efforts at the communities in most need. She also said the data surveillance team for the state will look into the possibility of expanding data on deaths to indicate how many head underlying conditions. Moving forward Governor Northam said his focus is on the health and well-being of Virginians, especially the health and well-being of workers. With the mask order going into effect Friday, he encouraged Virginians to use the next few days to get ready. He also emphasized in his closing remarks that the move is not to punish people but to promote safety because ""we're all in this together."" The governor encouraged everyone to cooperate and ""be a part of the solution"" so that Virginia can get the health crisis in the rearview mirror and begin returning to normal. The statewide situation in Virginia Most of Virginia officially entered Phase 1 of Gov. Northam's plan to gradually reopen the state on May 15, but the commonwealth remains under a series of public health orders and executive orders designed to slow the spread of COVID-19. Executive Order 53, which closed many non-essential businesses across Virginia and established Virginia's 10-person gathering limit, no longer applies in its original form as businesses originally deemed non-essential gradually reopen, but the 10-person gathering limit is still in place and still enforceable. Executive Order 55, the 'Stay at Home' order signed by Northam on March 30, is now a 'Safer at Home' order, instructing all Virginians to continue staying home as the safest way to prevent COVID-19's spread and specifically telling Virginians vulnerable to the virus to stay home except for essential needs. Virginia's state of emergency runs until June 10. The Virginia Supreme Court's judicial emergency, which suspended all non-essential, non-emergency court hearings, expired on May 17 and court hearings across most of Virginia resumed on Monday, May 18. In light of that, with some eviction cases resuming, Gov. Northam's office released a list of resources to help people who may be facing eviction while still with income affected by COVID-19. DMV offices in Virginia began gradually reopening on Monday, May 18, andhave 14 customer service centers around the state are open by appointment only for specific reasons. During the closure, Virginia State Police have not been enforcing inspections and extensions have been granted to people with expiring credentials for themselves or their vehicles. Elective procedures and related offices, like dentists, were able to resume on May 1 after Gov. Northam lifted the public health order that initially closed them. Of the orders in place, Executive Order 53 is enforceable by law, so someone who hosts a gathering of more than 10 people can be charged with a Class 1 misdemeanor. You can learn more about what police enforcement of Northam's executive orders looks like here. Virginia's local elections in May and the primaries in June have each been postponed by two weeks. Virginia officials are encouraging all voters to request absentee ballots. Statewide case totals and testing numbers as of May 26 By May 26, the Virginia Department of Health had received reports of 37,440 confirmed and 1,902 probable cases of COVID-19 across the commonwealth. ""Probable"" cases are cases that were diagnosed by a doctor based on symptoms and exposure without a test – also known as clinical diagnoses. Those positive test results are out of 298,270 total tests administered in Virginia, which included 265,279 PCR tests and 32,991 antibody tests (The Dept. of Health announced last Thursday that they would start breaking testing data down by diagnostic and antibody tests, following criticism for initially reporting the two together.) Last week, there were 10,208 tests reported from Tuesday to Wednesday, 6,758 test results reported from Wednesday to Thursday, and 7,983 new test results from Thursday to Friday. From Sunday to Monday, 17,246 new test results were reported – though, as noted near the top of this article, Monday's numbers included data from Sunday that was missed due to technical maintenance on the VDH system. Now, from Monday to Tuesday, 8,366 new PCR tests were reported and 325 new antibody tests. As Virginia's testing capacity has ramped up, with more community testing offered by local health districts, state health officials say the goal is to get tests to the areas in most need of them, with at-risk communities identified by the state health department. Testing events sponsored by health districts are not turning anyone away, however. Overall, considering testing numbers and positive results, about 13.2% of Virginians who have been tested have received positive results. At the start of May, that percentage was standing steadily around 17%, but with increased testing, it's come down over time. However, some localities have much higher percentages, as outlined in our ""local cases"" section below. At this point, 4,325 Virginians have been hospitalized due to the disease caused by the virus, and at least 1,236 have died of causes related to the disease. The hospitalization and death numbers are totals confirmed by the Virginia Department of Health, which are always delayed by several days due to the logistics of medical facilities reporting information to local health districts, which then report it to the state health department. The hospitalization numbers are cumulative — they represent the total number of people hospitalized due to the disease throughout the pandemic and not the total number currently in the hospital. For current hospitalization stats, the VHHA offers more helpful data. The state website shows a lot of detail by locality, including hospitalizations and deaths for each city or county, and are broken down by zip code here, if you want to track cases on a neighborhood level. Where are our local cases? Overall, according to the Virginia Department of Health's May 26 breakdown, 298,270 tests have been run for the virus in Virginia, with 39,342 positive results. The department's breakdown and location map, available to the public here, shows the number of cases confirmed each day, number of people tested, total hospitalizations, total deaths, demographic breakdowns, and testing numbers, as well as breakdowns by health district. Here's a breakdown of cases for our region as of 9 a.m. on May 26. You can find the breakdown for the entire state in the chart at the bottom of this article. Numbers sometimes decrease day to day when the health department determines that a test initially reported in one locality was actually for a resident of another city, county, or state. Central Shenandoah • Augusta County - 100 • Buena Vista - 13 • Harrisonburg - 742 • Highland County - 3 • Lexington - 6 • Rockbridge County - 17 • Rockingham County - 478 • Staunton - 36 • Waynesboro - 41 Outbreaks: 13, with 4 in long-term care facilities, 1 in a healthcare setting, 6 in congregate settings, 1 in a correctional facility, and 1 in an educational setting Total tests: 6,800 Local percent positive: 21.1% Lord Fairfax • Clarke County - 22 • Frederick County - 272 • Page County - 199 • Shenandoah County - 378 • Warren County - 117 • Winchester - 147 Outbreaks: 16, with 7 in long-term care facilities, 3 in healthcare settings, 5 in congregate settings, and 1 in a correctional facility Total tests: 3,408 Local percent positive: 33.3% Thomas Jefferson • Albemarle County - 161 • Charlottesville - 90 • Fluvanna County - 87 • Greene County - 25 • Louisa County - 73 • Nelson County - 15 Outbreaks: 7, with 4 in long-term care facilities, 1 in a correctional facility, and 2 in congregate settings Total tests: 8,260 Local percent positive: 5.5% Rappahannock Rapidan • Culpeper County - 638 • Fauquier County - 300 • Madison County - 37 • Orange County - 86 • Rappahannock County - 13 Outbreaks: 6, with 1 in a long-term care facility, 1 in a healthcare setting, and 4 in congregate settings Total tests: 6,294 Local percent positive: 17.1% Local outbreaks As numbers have climbed in parts of the Shenandoah Valley, much of the increase has been attributable to outbreaks within particular facilities. By May 25, the Central Shenandoah Health District had identified 13 outbreaks and the Lord Fairfax Health District had 16. Health department officials have not specified the majority of the locations of our outbreaks, because the Virginia Department of Health has interpreted Virginia code as treating facilities the same as ""persons,"" meaning their anonymity has to be protected. So information about outbreaks is only released to the public if a facility grants permission for that to be released, and that has not been often. Of the outbreaks in our area, several have been confirmed at long-term care centers, including at Accordius Health Harrisonburg, where 22 patients died of COVID-19; here"" target=""_blank"">Skyview Springs, where there have been 16 confirmed deaths; Ritenour Rest Home in Staunton, where Augusta Health has confirmed a ""COVID situation"" but no exact numbers have been provided; and three outbreaks in Shenandoah County, including one at an unnamed nursing home and two at unnamed assisted living facilities. Outbreaks have also been confirmed at New Market Poultry, the Harrisonburg Men's Diversion Center, with at least 25 positive cases, and LSC Communications, which had at least six cases by the end of April but then stopped providing updates on their employee hotline so that media outlets would not have access to the information, which was not publicly provided. Also, New Market Poultry Products, which has more than 100 employees working on a daily basis, confirmed near the end of April that they had multiple employees test positive – though an exact number was not provided and no update has come since then. None of the other Shenandoah Valley poultry plants have released any information about COVID-19 cases to the public, though 18 workers tested positive at the Pilgrim's Pride in Moorefield and Cargill in Dayton has confirmed the death of one employee due to COVID-19 – though never any information on the number of cases at the facility. Poultry plants and other meat processing facilities have been hotspots for the virus across the country and a focus of Gov. Northam's in Virginia. State health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver has also referenced the situation at poultry plants in Harrisonburg leading to a disproportionate number of cases among the Latino community in the Shenandoah Valley, though, again the facilities themselves have released no information publicly. Many of the local outbreaks that do not have confirmed locations have been identified in congregate settings, which could include workplaces, apartment complexes, churches, gyms, or any setting with a group of people in one place. Hospitalizations Of the state's 4,325 total hospitalizations, at least 114 have been in the Central Shenandoah Health District. Of those, 2 have been in Augusta County, 1 in Buena Vista, 53 in Harrisonburg, 51 in Rockingham County, 5 in Staunton, and 2 in Waynesboro. In the Lord Fairfax Health District, there have been at least 104 hospitalizations. Thirty-six of those have been in Shenandoah County and 23 in Page County. Deaths As far as deaths, there have been 17 reported in Shenandoah County, 21 in Page County, one in Augusta County, 21 in Harrisonburg, and six in Rockingham County. Deaths, like all health department data, are reported by a person's listed residence. Dr. Norm Oliver, the state's health commissioner, has said that it often takes several days before local health districts are able to enter death information into the state database. Dr. Laura Kornegay, director of the Central Shenandoah Health District, told WHSV that deaths first have to be reported to them by medical facilities, which is a major cause for delays that have often been seen on the numbers reported for our area. Dr. Kornegay also explained that if someone has tested positive for COVID-19, that's what goes on their death certificate. Those death certificates have a space to list secondary causes of death, and that's where ongoing health issues like heart disease and cancer are listed. Some people have accused medical facilities of artificially inflating death tolls by doing that, but it's the same process by which flu deaths are reported every year. West Virginia updates In the part of West Virginia we cover, there have been 11 confirmed cases in Grant County, 37 confirmed cases in Hardy County, and 9 confirmed cases in Pendleton County. Recovery Wondering about the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19 in Virginia? Recovery information is not required to be sent to the Department of Health, so there is no accurate way to track that data for every single confirmed case. Individual health districts may track cases as ""active"" and ""non-active,"" but that data is not published anywhere in aggregate. But there is a way to track the number of patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 and have since been discharged – effectively tracking how many people have recovered from the most severe cases. The Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association updates their own dashboard of data each day on hospital-specific statistics, including bed availability, ventilator usage, and more. Their online dashboard indicates that, as of May 26, at least 5,227 COVID-19 patients have been discharged from the hospital. Unlike the VDH data that reports cumulative hospitalizations, their data on hospitalizations reflects people currently hospitalized for COVID-19 (whether with confirmed or pending cases), and that number is at 1,403. The data used by the VDH to report cumulative hospitalizations is based on information reported in hospital claims. On the other hand, the numbers reported by the Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association are based on a current census from hospitals, which provides a separate data set. Updates from Gov. Northam's May 22 briefing The latest Virginia data and prevention As has been the norm for Governor Northam's COVID-19 briefings, he began Friday's by reviewing the latest data on Virginia's cases and testing, which has shown the number of tests trending upward the percent of positive tests trending downward. However, as positive test percentages continue to trend down, the governor says it's just as important, if not more important, to continue following the basic guidelines on how to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including social distancing of at least 6 feet, hand-washing, and wearing a face covering in public. A mandatory face mask order? Gov. Northam emphasized that wearing a face covering could potentially save someone else's life, since they are worn to protect others from yourself, with many people carrying the virus without symptoms. The governor said face coverings are an important part of Virginia's next steps and that he'll have more to say on that next week, when the next state briefing happens on Tuesday. While not outright saying that he'll be issuing a mask order, he very strongly suggested it. Later in the briefing, the governor was asked about Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney's request for a mask order for the capital city. Northam said he has been in communication with Richmond officials about it, but has also been discussing plans for a policy with his COVID-19 task force and working through the details. He said one of their focuses is on equity: being able to make sure everyone has access to a mask, and pointed to many ways people can wear face coverings without purchasing a specific surgical mask, like using bandannas, or following online instructions for DIY masks without needing to sew. Another focus, he said, has been how his administration could enforce such an order. Masks are intended to protect other people, Northam reminded Virginians, and said that's the main goal for COVID-19 response. He clarified that his announcement on Tuesday will be for all of Virginia and will especially apply to places of business. What about Phase 2 and the plan for areas still in Phase 0? The governor said he knows everyone is wondering when Virginia will enter Phase 2 and when northern Virginia, Accomack County, and Richmond will be able to enter Phase 1 with the rest of the state. He said his team is in constant communication with the localities that are still in Phase 0 at their requests, and he'll have more on the timeline for the next phase for those areas and the rest of the state next week as well. A new assessment tool Governor Northam announced that the Virginia Department of Health is launching a new tool to let people check their symptoms and find the closest testing site to their location. It's called ""COVID Check,"" a telehealth and online risk assessment tool that you can find: HERE. Northam said it will ask you for your symptoms, and, based on your responses, give recommendations on what you should do next, including options on where you can go to get testing. A statewide testing effort Northam highlighted the Virginia Department of Health's community testing events across the commonwealth, which included more than 4,300 tests given this week. He thanked the Virginia National Guard, which has conducted over 10,000 tests so far, and showed a slide featuring multiple community testing events organized by the health department for the coming week, including one in Rockingham County. After thanking the National Guard for their testing assistance, Northam also thanked them for their work rescuing people from severe flooding in southwest Virginia over the past few days. The pilot program for online SNAP ordering The governor also announced the pilot project approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week to allow Virginia families who receive SNAP benefits to order groceries online through select retailers and have them delivered. Right now, the plan includes Walmart and Amazon, but more retailers are expected to be added in the coming weeks. It will launch on May 29, Northam said, and will allow families with low incomes to get access to nutritious food without having to leave their homes and will help keep people with underlying conditions from having to go out. He thanked Virginia's senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, for pushing to make the pilot program possible. Unemployment in Virginia Virginia had 44,000 new claims for unemployment insurance over the past week, bringing the state's current unemployment rate up to 10.6%. Gov. Northam pointed to the state's 2.8% rate before the pandemic as a sign of how strong Virginia was doing on the business front before COVID-19, but said his administration is working to help those left unemployed as much as possible. Thousands of Virginians have reported problems with the Virginia Employment Commission system, left unable to access a real person for help with questions and left without receiving benefits, though. To help respond to that, Northam said on Friday that he knows many people have had difficulties, and the Virginia Employment Commission (VEC) is opening up a new call center with 315 additional employees to help handle the influx of calls. A plan for graduates With high schoolers and college students across Virginia not able to have their traditional graduation ceremonies this year, Gov. Northam announced that Virginia Public Media will be airing a celebration of all Virginia graduates called ""Virginia Graduates Together"" next Friday, May 29, at 5 p.m. Across the state, all public TV channels will air the ceremony, which will feature special guests to honor 2020 graduates. He encouraged graduating seniors to submit photos, videos, and special messages for the ceremony to Virginia Public Media at vpm.org/grad. Eid This weekend marks Eid al-Fitr, holy days for Muslims, and Gov. Northam wished all Muslims in Virginia a blessed and joyous celebration, but encouraged safe celebrations amid the pandemic. Memorial Day With this coming Monday marking Memorial Day, Gov. Northam said he's asking all Virginians to remember this weekend what the day is for and to recognize all members of the U.S. military who have given it all and made the ultimate sacrifice. He encouraged reflections on their sacrifices and said the Virginia War Memorial's annual event will be a virtual one this Monday. Virginia state flags will be flying at half-staff to honor all the sacrifices of the military on Monday, and at half-staff to honor COVID-19 victims over the weekend, just like President Trump's order for U.S. flags on federal buildings. While people mark the holiday weekend, Northam encouraged all Virginians to maintain social distancing, avoid large gatherings, and wear face coverings. The unemployment work search requirement Throughout this pandemic, the Virginia Employment Commission has not been enforcing their normal work search requirement for people to receive unemployment insurance. Megan Healy, Gov. Ralph Northam’s chief workforce development adviser, explained that that requirement will not be re-instituted until the Virginia Employment Commission's 61 work search centers are reopen. At this point, they all remain closed and employees are working remotely. Unemployment trust fund running empty Healy said reports that Virginia's trust fund for unemployment insurance is running out of money are correct. While the additional $600 a week for unemployment and the PUA program are paid for directly by the federal government, she said the large influx of unemployment claims across Virginia, like around the nation, have drained the state's unemployment insurance fund, which is normally paid for through state taxes. The state is asking the federal government for assistance. President Trump's order for places of worship Minutes before Gov. Northam took the podium for his briefing, President Donald Trump announced that he was deeming houses of worship essential services and called on governors to allow them to reopen this weekend. Asked for his response, Governor Northam said he wants to be sure people can practice their faith safely, and that's why his administration moved houses of worship to the same guidelines as retail in Phase 1 of the 'Forward Virginia' plan. Both places of worship and retail stores are allowed to operate at 50% capacity with social distancing measures and increased sanitation in place. However, he said he's not requiring houses of worship to open up to in-person services and knows many have chosen to continue drive-in or live-streamed services. It's up to the individual church, mosque, temple, or other house of worship. A recent spike in deaths in the state numbers Asked about one day this week in which the Virginia Department of Health statistics indicated a rise of dozens of deaths in a day, the governor reiterated a point state health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver has made before, which is that the deaths added to the state database in a given day don't necessarily line up with when the deaths occurred. That's due to delays between death certificates being filed, the healthcare agency reporting that death to their local health district, and the health district then reporting the death to the health department. So on the state level, they are focusing directly on the death certificates and their issued dates to analyze any potential spikes, following every death, because he said every death is important. Releasing data from point prevalence testing at long-term care facilities Dr. Forlano, who has been heading up Virginia's task force focused on responding to COVID-19 at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in Virginia, said there are 43 facilities statewide in the process of testing everyone for COVID-19 at this moment. That's in addition to point prevalence testing conducted at other facilities in recent weeks. While they'll be releasing aggregate data from that testing on the overall situation at Virginia long-term care facilities, they are not planning to provide specifics about the number of cases at any given facility, in line with previous health department guidance treating facilities as ""persons."" Memorial Day travel from areas in Phase 0 The governor issued a reminder that all Virginians in areas that are still under Phase 0 – Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County – are still under the 'Stay at Home' order and should only leave home for essential reasons. He urged them not to travel over Memorial Day weekend to other parts of Virginia that may be further along the reopening process. Regional reopening plans Asked about how those ares being behind the guidelines for the rest of the state will affect the overall reopening timeline, Gov. Northam once again went back to his description of the state guidelines as ""a floor,"" with regions able to have more restrictions, but not less. That plan is not changing, the governor said, but the rest of Virginia will not have to wait on Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County either. He said each of those areas will stay on their own timelines and is expected to move into Phase 1, 2, and 3 at different times than the rest of the commonwealth. What about reporting recovery numbers? Asked about why Virginia does not report the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver explained that the VDH system is set up to identify cases as they're reported and then trace any people potentially exposed to the Virginians with confirmed cases. The department does not provide care to the patients, so he said they don't necessarily know any information about the recovery of each person with a case. Instead, the health department's limit is reporting the cases as they get them, providing the information on those cases – including on local levels down to the ZIP code – and that's about it, because they don't have continuing data on each case. However, state officials do point people to the VHHA data reported each day, which tracks the number of active hospitalizations for COVID-19 and the number of previously hospitalized patients who have been discharged. There's a lot of information on patients who have recovered, officials said, especially since that encompasses at least 95% of people who contract the virus. And we should celebrate those who survive and recover, they said. The role of antibody tests Dr. Laurie Forlano said the VDH website has guidelines on when providers should use different kind of testing, like antibody tests, but said everyone is still learning about the best role of antibody testing in the process. She encouraged people to talk to their healthcare providers directly about potential antibody tests. In addition, health commissioner Dr. Oliver encouraged any Virginians who have gotten antibody tests and tested positive for the COVID-19 antibody to still take all necessary precautions to prevent getting the virus, because it's not clear yet whether testing positive for the antibody actually prevents someone from being infected. Stay safe on the roads if traveling Public health secretary Brian Moran said traffic on Virginia's roads has been significantly reduced throughout the pandemic as people stay at home, and they expect low numbers this Memorial Day weekend, but they have seen some ridiculous three-digit speeding tickets of drivers taking advantage of the empty roads. He encouraged anyone traveling this weekend to observe the speed limit, stay safe, and arrive safely. Memorial Day weekend and mask preparations Governor Northam closed out Friday's briefing by asking Virginians to mark Memorial Day with respect and remembrance for the many men and women who have paid the ultimate price in service of their country. He said to thank any active duty military members and veterans if you see them this weekend as well. He also said that he likes to give homework over the weekends, as he has mentioned at past briefings, and this weekend's has to do with masks. Even more strongly suggesting a pending mask order than earlier in the briefing, he said all Virginians should make plans this weekend for you and your family to have face coverings. All children 3 and up are encouraged to wear face masks in most guidance so far, and Northam said that's because children are likely to carry the virus without showing symptoms and potentially spread it to others. He encouraged Virginians to find any way to get face coverings that is available to them – whether that's by buying them at local stores, making them with online instructions, or using bandannas or other materials you already have. And be ready on Tuesday to go out with those face coverings when conducting any public business, if you're not already, he said. Meanwhile, his administration will be doing their work by finalizing the details of the new policy they expect to announce on Tuesday. Previous updates from Gov. Northam's May 20 briefing Spanish translation Governor Ralph Northam began Wednesday's briefing by noting that the Virginia Department of Emergency Management started offering a version of his briefings on Monday with live Spanish language interpretation on the VDEM Facebook page. That will continue for the foreseeable future. Virginia's data metrics and testing As is the norm for the governor, who has been noted throughout the pandemic as the nation's only medical doctor serving as a governor, he reviewed the most recent data on Virginia's COVID-19 case trends. Northam pointed to the state's percent positivity, which has been steadily decreasing over the past week with more testing. He reminded Virginians that there are multiple ways to get tested for COVID-19 amid the pandemic, including the most common avenues through healthcare providers, hospitals, and clinics, as well as through community testing events sponsored by local health districts. A key part of the testing process comes after a test returns with a positive result, and that's contact tracing – through which health department officials determine anyone who was in close contact with an infected person and instruct those people to self-quarantine. The governor touched back on a topic that state health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver has been addressing for a few weeks, which is that the Virginia Department of Health is working to hire 1,000 contact tracers and 200 supervisors for contact tracing efforts in the state. Access to PPE in Virginia After questions were raised in recent days regarding the supply of personal protective equipment in Virginia, Gov. Northam said that PPE is at a place where hospitals have an adequate supply. No hospitals have reported problems obtaining PPE for a few weeks now, but this week, the VHHA started publicly reporting the number of licensed nursing facilities that have indicated PPE shortages, and there are at least 10 without enough N95 masks and 21 without enough isolation gowns. The governor said the Virginia Department of Emergency Management has a stockpile available for any facility in need, but that healthcare providers need to let the department know, so that resources can be provided. According to Northam, VDEM, so far in the pandemic, has distributed more than 795,000 N95 masks, 1.3 million surgical masks, 3 million gloves, 285,331 isolation gowns, 427,000 face shields, and 24,359 containers of hand sanitizer to facilities around the state. He said the department's priority is to support response at facilities deemed high risk and to support those reporting need. But, Northam said, the directive has been that healthcare providers should exhaust supplies of PPE obtained from private supply chains before asking for public supplies. He said the Department of General Services established a rapid review process for vendors that can supply PPE to healthcare providers and has a list of suppliers online at dgs.virginia.gov. Northam also described a Virginia partnership with Amazon to support PPE orders directly and an effort by FEMA to ship PPE directly to Virginia nursing homes, with two shipments so far, each with at least a week's worth of equipment. If a facility has run out of PPE obtained through private supply chains, he said the facility needs to contact the Virginia Department of Emergency Management so that state officials can get them more. Access to healthcare Governor Northam took part of Wednesday's briefing to discuss access to health care in Virginia, which he said he believes is a right. The governor said the state's expansion of Medicaid in 2018 has allowed more than 421,000 Virginians to enroll in Medicaid coverage, offering health care to people who did not have access before. Praising the Medicaid expansion, Northam said families have been able to get treatment for underlying conditions that can make people more vulnerable to COVID-19 complications, and said everyone ""should be grateful"" for the expanded coverage during this pandemic. However, he said there's more work to do for all Virginians to have access to health care, so to help with that, he announced that he's convening a new work group that will focus on identifying ways to reduce costs and increase access to healthcare for all Virginians. Also, in light of his efforts to expand access, Northam commended the General Assembly for banning ""balanced billing"" in the most recent legislative session, but declared that he's vetoing three bills: Senate Bill 861, Senate Bill 235, and House Bill 795. The governor said each of those bills passed by lawmakers would address health care costs for targeted groups of Virginians but that he felt it best to veto them to focus on ""more broad-based health care solutions for all Virginians."" He encouraged the bills' sponsors to work with the new work group to find solutions for a broader group. AARP Virginia swiftly issued a response applauding the governor's vetoes, saying he ""used his veto power today to stop three health care measures that would have had a calamitous impact on older and sicker Virginians."" Substance abuse and recovery amid COVID-19 Gov. Northam said he's well aware that people in recovery from substance abuse disorders are facing increased challenges during the pandemic, describing increases in overdoses in Roanoke County and spikes of overdoses in the northern Shenandoah Valley specifically. He said his administration is working to respond to that situation by encouraging telehealth and loosening restrictions to allow more telehealth options for substance abuse treatment, promoting video meetings for recovery groups, and pushing other similar options. The governor said the Department of Behavioral Health has a list of ongoing virtual recovery groups on their website. Local and primary elections After Virginia's local elections on Tuesday, Gov. Northam said the day went smoothly, thanking Virginia's Board of Elections and the thousands of volunteers around the state who helped maintain safe polling places for in-person voting. Northam also thanked Virginians for following the state's recommendation to vote absentee by mail. He said more than 55,000 absentee ballots were cast for Tuesday, compared to around 1,700 in the comparable May local election in 2016. Looking ahead to the next election, Virginia's June primaries, he said the state is again is strongly encouraging people to vote absentee by mail. The deadline to request an absentee ballot, which can be done online or through your local registrar's office, is 5 p.m. on June 16, a week ahead of the election day itself o June 23. Live Health Equity Work Group meeting At 7 p.m. on Thursday, May 21, Virginia's Health Equity Work Group, which Gov. Northam has frequently discussed at his briefings, will be holding a live meeting that Virginians can view on WRIC, the ABC affiliate in Richmond. The Virginia National Guard's response As the Virginia National Guard has worked around the commonwealth to provide testing through local health district community testing events and coordinated nursing home testing, four Guard members have tested positive for COVID-19. The head of Virginia's National Guard said those four members were out of over 120 helping provide testing statewide and that none of the National Guard members working in the field are carrying the virus. He said they are rigorously screened ahead of each testing event. The Guard is focusing on testing as many long-term care centers as possible, with health department coordination, but that's just one component of their overall testing effort, according to Command Sergeant Major Ronald L. Smith Jr.. They've also requested funding from the federal government for the Guard to offer more resources at local testing events. How Virginia is helping in low-income communities Asked how Virginia is responding to the need for tests in low-income and minority communities around Virginia, Gov. Northam said he'll bring a list on Friday to highlight the lower socio-economic communities around the state with planned health district testing events. Northam said it's key to be able to enter Phases 2 and 3 that adequate testing is available to everyone around the commonwealth, and said Dr. Karen Remley's testing work group is working hand-in-hand with the health department to make that possible. He also thanked the work of free health clinics across Virginia, which have seen large increases in patients during the pandemic, even with dropping donations as they work to expand access to health care. Calling healthcare a right, the governor said he wants ""all Virginians to have access to quality and affordable care."" What data metrics are guiding future plans? Asked what data metrics he and his cabinet are using to determine when Virginia can begin Phase 2 or determine if any localities need to go back to increased restrictions, the governor said they're using the same metrics that were used to enter Phase 1. In particular, those focus on the number of new cases, percent positivity, the amount of PPE available, testing capability, hospital capacity and equipment available at hospitals, as well as staffing available at healthcare centers. Northam said each of those is based on guidance from the CDC and the White House, and their focus is on trends in the data over week and two-week spans: not particularly paying attention to day by day numbers, which vary. He said they currently do not have any specific thresholds, like a specific percent positivity increase, that would result in increased restrictions for a locality. However, the governor said his team meets every day to review the latest data to catch any potential dangerous increase in cases at a locality's level, since the best way to prevent escalations is to catch them at the start. He said if trends rise in a specific locality or zip code, action will be taken as needed, whether that be offering more testing or reversing Phase 1 guidelines, but said that hasn't had to be done yet. If any localities choose to ignore the state guidelines, regardless of data, Northam said he'll direct concerns about that to the locality. The future for Northern Virginia Governor Northam said his staff is in daily communication with leaders throughout Northern Virginia to determine how that region, which remains in Phase 0 at local leaders' request, will move forward. Asked about his response to specific localities, including parts of counties and cities in the area, requesting to enter parts of Phase 1 guidance, he said the policy is for the guidelines in place to be ""the floor"" and that localities within the area can go farther with restrictions but not loosen them to keep consistency for the region, which has also been coordinating with Maryland and Washington, D.C. While his team is following the latest data trends, Northam said he does not have a specific date set yet for the start of Phase 2, which would come, at the earliest, on May 29. Northam said it will happen when the data supports it and when local leaders are comfortable with it. Funding from the feds Asked about funding being provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Gov. Northam said a significant amount will be directed toward testing supplies and staff to administer tests at long-term care facilities, as well as boosting Virginia's contact tracing capability. Details of contact tracing On the note of contact tracing, health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver was asked about the process and how information on people is shared. Dr. Oliver explained that contact tracers working with local health districts speak someone who has just received a positive test for COVID-19, have them isolate themselves, determine who the person has been in close contact with, and reach out to each of those people to instruct them to self-quarantine. Throughout the time that someone is self-quarantined, contact tracers stay in communication with them to help them manage the process and check in on how they're doing and progressing. If their condition changes, they're urged to seek treatment and testing. While people are under observation in self-quarantine, Dr. Oliver said their names are not released to the public, but that they do encourage people to release their names to healthcare providers for help with monitoring conditions, and assistance with getting food, medicine, and other services. How is information on community testing events being shared? Anytime a community testing event has been scheduled, the governor said health districts are reaching out to legislators and local officials for their help spreading the word, as well as looking to local media to share the information on when and where the events are happening. When testing is available in a particular neighborhood, Gov. Northam said they encouraged not only people with symptoms to get tested, but anyone who may be concerned they were exposed or worried because they live with a vulnerable person and want to be sure they won't spread the virus. Those providing the testing will not turn anyone way. How can a locality get testing? Northam said if any specific locality wants health district testing, they can notify their local health district and the Virginia Department of Health, which will then work with them to get their area testing. If they let VDEM know the situation, more PPE can be provided as well. In a better place than before Asked to reflect on Virginia's progress in the pandemic, Northam said that it was a rough start, like most of the country, but pointed to better supplies, better testing capacity, and better healthcare preparedness now, thanking Virginians for working through a difficult time for everyone and for following the state's guidelines. He compared the novel virus to a novel, saying that every day brings a new chapter or two to the situation, and that while he wishes he knew how the last chapter will read, no one does yet, and everyone is in it together to get there as safely as possible. With businesses opening, what about yard sales and flea markets? Virginia's deputy secretary of commerce and trade came to the podium to address a reporter's question about guidance for businesses that may not fit the traditional definitions for which most guidance has been offered. She said the department has a comprehensive suite of guidelines for businesses that can open with restrictions in Phase 1, but any events and/or businesses, like flea markets and yard sales, that aren't brick-and-mortar retail establishments just need to meet the general guidelines for Phase 1, including face coverings for workers who interact with people, sanitation of high-touch surfaces, protections for workers, and all basic guidelines that apply to businesses in general. When is Phase 2 coming? Governor Northam said there is no specific date for Phase 2 at this point. His team will keep watching the data in the coming days, with the earliest possible date being May 29, but as of now, no date is set and no date is set for him to announce a decision, since it's based on data changing day by day. Childcare and unemployment The Virginia Employment Commission, which manages the unemployment insurance program in the commonwealth, is overseen by the federal government and has to follow federal guidelines. Because of that, while schools have been closed, their closure has provided a legally acceptable reason for unemployment, summer coming means that is about to change, and they'll be federally mandated to stop unemployment benefits when that's the provided reason. So the VEC says they are working to figure out options related to childcare in the summer months. Northam's closing notes Governor Northam said he wants to let everyone know he understands everyone has been through a very difficult time over these months, as a lot of people have made sacrifices, many have lost their jobs, access to healthcare and PPE has been a challenge, and addition has become its own crisis. However, he said he wants people to remember that everyone is on edge right now. He mentioned the ice cream shop in Michigan that had to close back down due to customers being extremely rude on their first day back open, and said people need to understand that everyone has been under stress. We can agree to disagree on specific things, the governor said, but ""at the end of the day, we all have to work together."" He said his message to Virginians, who live in the best state in the country, is to ""be kind,"" because that's how everyone can get through the pandemic together and get the health crisis and then the economic crisis behind us. Previous updates from Gov. Northam's May 18 briefing Reminding Virginians to keep following safety guidelines Governor Ralph Northam began Monday's briefing with a reminder for all Virginians to keep following all CDC and VDH guidelines for their safety throughout Phase 1. It's a gradual process of lifting restrictions and does not mean that the pandemic is over, he reminded everyone, and, if anything, said it's more important than ever as more places open up to keep following all recommendations. Speaking about masks and face coverings, Northam said some people may find it inconvenient, but urged everyone to remember that it can save other people's lives. He said from what he's seen, most people have been following the guidelines, and he appreciates that. The latest data Gov. Northam quickly highlighted the latest data on COVID-19 testing in Virginia, showing graphs and charts that have become a mainstay of his thrice-weekly briefings. The latest numbers continue trends of increased testing in Virginia, along with decreased percent positivity – the amount of Virginians who got tests who test positive over a 7-day span. He said his team's focus has been to ramp up testing specifically in areas with at-risk populations, using a map from the Virginia Department of Health showing all the current health department-sponsored testing sites in at-risk areas, with many in northern Virginia, which has seen, by far, the highest proportion of cases in the commonwealth. Northam also pointed to the work of Virginia's Health Equity Group, which is distributing masks and hand sanitizer, along with educational flyers, in high-risk areas identified by health officials. The next plan for that distribution is in Petersburg, alongside testing, on May 23. The group previously rolled out a similar initiative in Harrisonburg and will carry out another one in Richmond. Reopening Virginia Beach Governor Northam announced in Monday's COVID-19 briefing that Virginia Beach will be opening up to the public for recreational activity as of Friday, May 22, kicking off Memorial Day weekend. The governor said Virginia Beach specifically had been working on a comprehensive plan to reopen their beach safely, with social distancing measures in place, for weeks, and that he had asked Virginia's director of natural resources to help them toughen up their plan. With a new plan in place that the governor says will allow safer use of the beach, he approved Virginia Beach's request to reopen on May 22 for activities including swimming, surfing, fishing, and other recreational activities. Not allowed will be group activities, including group sports like volleyball, speakers playing music to large groups, alcohol, tents and groups of umbrellas, and other group-related activities. The city's parking garages and parking lots for the beach will be limited to 50 percent capacity as a way to reduce group sizes. However, Gov. Northam said if people swarm the beach and ignore restrictions, he ""will not hesitate"" to put restrictions back into place and go as far as closing the beach if necessary. Northam said his message to any beach-goers is simple: ""You must be responsible."" The governor invited the Virginia Beach mayor to the podium, and the mayor said he believes opening up beaches is healthy for people physically, mentally, and emotionally. However, he said he and the governor share a primary concern, which is making sure that people who go to the beach to receive those health benefits do it safely. The mayor said the city's plan is meant to protect visitors, residents, and the thousands of frontline staff who keep businesses along the beach running. To do that, the city has hired hundreds of people to serve as ""beach ambassadors,"" who will help coordinated efforts to clean high-touch surfaces and will enforce the beach's regulations. They'll also have teams dedicated to educating visitors about the new rules. Acknowledging that beaches around the country have faced compliance problems, he said he wants people to know that they are welcome to Virginia Beach and are safe, but that the city is asking them to comply with the rules. Those rules, the mayor said, will benefit everyone as friends and neighbors. Governor Northam emphasized that the opening applies only to Virginia Beach and First Landing State Park – not to any other beaches in the state. But he encouraged other beaches to look to Virginia Beach's plan as a model for any reopening plans for the future. The Virginia Republican Party's response on Monday was mixed. ""We're finally seeing movement in the right direction, but there is still a disappointing lack of trust in people and local governments to be able to use what we know about this virus to be able to open as safely as possible,"" said House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert. ""We can’t stay shuttered forever. The Governor’s energy should be focused on providing specific guidance to people and businesses on how to interact safely rather than telling them what they can’t do."" The plan for schools moving forward In late March, Gov. Northam became the first state governor to order schools closed for the remainder of the academic year, followed in the coming weeks and months by similar decisions in other states. Northam said on Monday that his administration's decision on school closings proved to be the right choice. But, moving into the summer, he said he knows that school staff and administrators, along with families, are looking at what will come next in the fall. In regards to that, Gov. Northam announced a new team of education leaders that will meet with Virginia's public health team in the coming weeks to develop specific ""next steps"" for public and private K-12 schools, as well as for colleges and universities. The team is made up of local school superintendents, public and private college and university presidents, school officials, the Virginia Department of Education, and student representatives. It's called the Virginia COVID-19 Education Work Group, and representatives of the group say they're focusing their guidance on making sure Virginia schools have consistent guidelines on continuity of learning. Responding to a question about how important is is to him to get students back into schools by the fall, Northam said it was an easy question because ""it's very important."" He commended educators for the work they've done throughout the pandemic to move into new forms of virtual educations and other ways to keep students learning, but said it's not a perfect solution. His view, he said, is that children will be better off back in classrooms because, as he described it, it's an equity issue. He pointed to the 550,000 families across Virginia who don't have access to broadband and don't have ways to access virtual education. ""I am hopeful that our students will be back in the classroom this fall,"" Northam said. The newly appointed team will find ways to make that safely happen. Courts and evictions Most courts across Virginia officially reopened on Monday after the end of a judicial emergency order from the Supreme Court of Virginia. Unfortunately, Northam said, that means some eviction cases that been put on hold will be moving forward. While the governor is not specifically deferring eviction cases or taking any similar action, he highlighted a number of actions his administration has taken and resources available. The governor said his cabinet is working with Virginia Housing, the state housing agency, which has committed $12 million to support nonprofit housing support services for anyone who may have lost housing. He also said legislation was amended earlier in the pandemic to allow tenants a 60-day deferral on eviction if they can prove COVID-19-related economic hardships. Northam said his team is pushing the federal government to include money for rent assistance in any future federal stimulus package. In addition, the governor said stayhomevirginia.com has resources for landlords, tenants, and the homeless, as well as a summary of resources for people in need of housing assistance. Asked if he'll be taking any further measures, like have been taken in some states to defer the need for people to go to court to submit financial documents to prove financial hardship, the governor reiterated the moves he had already described. VDEM staffing change Gov. Northam announced that Dr. Jeff Stern, the coordinator of emergency management for Virginia, is moving on to work with FEMA, where he will train emergency managers around the country. Local elections Local elections in many areas around the state are happening on Tuesday, and Gov. Northam said he hopes most Virginians already voted absentee by mail, but said crews will be hard at work cleaning and putting social distancing measures in place at polling locations so everyone can be safe as possible when voting. The Virginia Medical Reserve Corps will be helping to staff polling places to reduce risk to many normal volunteers who may be in vulnerable populations. What about candidates filing for November? Some candidates for local elections in November have a deadline to file a petition with enough signatures to get their names on the November ballot by June 9. State officials said that neither Virginia's department of elections, nor the governor, can change that deadline under their statutory authority. However, Northam encouraged all candidates to find ways to be creative going forward to try and get those petitions completed, and said, if unable, they can petition the courts for relief. Face mask requirement discrepancies Gov. Northam was asked why facial coverings are mandatory for some sectors of retail in Phase 1 while not for others. He said a lot of what went into that decision boiled down to focusing on those who serve others, like restaurant and grocery store employees, which led to a priority for facial coverings. Concerned employees Coming back to a point made in past briefings, Northam said it's very important to his administration that Virginians can make it known if they don't feel comfortable in their workplace. While Virginia has to work within federal guidelines on unemployment insurance and other standards, the governor again issued a reminder that any employee can file a complaint through the Department of Labor and Industry if their workplace is unsafe or can contact OSHA. He said he's tried to be as open as possible about that and encouraged Virginians to use the options available to them. Virginia's remdesivir distribution process Remdesivir is the only drug to receive some level of FDA approval as a potential COVID-19 treatment. It has showed effectiveness in shortening symptoms for some of the most severe cases of the viruses and in reducing mortality. But there is a very limited supply nationwide. According to state health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver, Gilead Sciences, the developer of the drug, donated about a million and a half doses to the federal government, which then sent out initial shipments to hospitals with high numbers of cases, including in northern Virginia. After that, any new distributions have been sent directly to the Virginia Department of Health, where a medical advisory committee of healthcare providers has developed an allocation process to randomly select hospitals in Virginia for remdesivir distribution. Dr. Oliver said the process is set up so that every individual patient hospitalized with COVID-19 in Virginia has an equally random chance at receiving the medication. For instance, Virginia recently got 10 cases of the drug, which were distributed through that process, and has 96 cases, containing enough medication for about 400 patients, coming in now. Dr. Oliver said the process will be used for that shipment as well to give everyone an equal chance of receiving it. The goal for percent positivity As testing has increased in Virginia, percent positivity has been slowly declining. Dr. Forlano said the goal for Virginia is to get down to a 10% rate or lower. The trends are moving in that direction, but it will take some time. Response to the Legislative Black Caucus Last week, the Legislative Black Caucus issued a statement against Phase 1 starting on May 15, saying that black people would be ""used as guinea pigs"" in the reopening plan. Gov. Northam was asked again on Monday about how he's addressed their concerns, and he pointed back to his answer on Friday, which primarily related to the work of Virginia's Health Equity Group, which has focused on getting tests, PPE, and support into minority communities at high risk of the virus. The COVID-19-linked condition in children The CDC has recently alerted doctors to an inflammatory syndrome in some children around the country that appears to be connected to COVID-19. State health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver said the Virginia Department of Health has learned of one case of the syndrome in Virginia and is getting more data. Gov. Northam said the situation surrounding the potential effects on children is a great example of the need for antibody tests, because the syndrome can happen weeks after a child was exposed to the virus, when a PCR test would give a negative result but an antibody test would show the child had contracted the virus. Will testing criteria be changing? Dr. Karen Remley, head of Virginia's testing task force, said that about two weeks ago, the recommendation in Virginia was for anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 or anyone who had been in close contact with someone with symptoms to get tested for the virus. Those were the criteria regular testing sites, like hospitals, were looking for. However, she said many opportunities for others have been available around the states, including testing for people getting elective procedures, for mothers about to give birth, and at some pharmacies. As far as testing offered by local health districts in certain communities, like the event planned in Waynesboro this week, Dr. Remley said the testing is designed to focus on high-risk areas, and that will remain their first focus. She also said that any health department event is meant for people who are symptomatic or who think they've been exposed, but their approach is to never turn anyone away from testing at those mobile testing sites. Testing delays Dr. Remley also said some labs and clinics in the state are still submitting COVID-19 test results through paper methods while they continue working to get their electronic systems to sync up with the Virginia Department of Health, so that has resulted in delays between some tests being processed and when they appear in the state system. As that gets resolved, testing numbers each day should appear higher. PPE shortages in nursing homes On Monday, the VHHA across Virginia. One of the key things it showed was that a number of nursing homes are still reporting difficulties obtaining personal protective equipment, like N95 masks and isolation gowns. Gov. Northam said the state has PPE in stock and has an incoming shipment. He essentially said that the Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) has the supplies if nursing homes follow the correct process to request more. The governor said the department is working with licensed nursing facilities to make sure they know the process, and said it's unacceptable that nursing homes would ask workers to use the same equipment until it's unsafe, as some workers have reported happening. Virginia has a great stock of PPE now, after earlier shortages, Northam reiterated, and said it's available to any nursing home, prison, hospital, or similar facility that requests it through VDEM. If anyone is hearing of PPE shortages at local nursing homes, he told them that the administrators can request the material and then state officials will work to get it to them. Going forward ""This virus has not changed,"" Northam said, emphasizing that it's critically important for people to keep following CDC guidelines, keep physically distancing, and keep wearing face coverings to protect others as more places open up. ""We are all responsible for the health of our neighbors and of our community,"" he said. Previous updates from Gov. Northam's May 15 briefing How Virginia is counting its tests Governor Ralph Northam began Friday's briefing by discussing the way testing data is reported in Virginia, which became a hot topic earlier this week. On Thursday, the Virginia Department of Health announced that they would begin separating out testing data between diagnostic and antibody tests, rather than only reporting all tests together. Gov. Northam said he first became aware that the department was reporting the testing data altogether on Monday. That's the same day health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver was asked in the state briefing why his department was counting the antibody tests in the total number reported each day. At the time, Dr. Oliver said the health department had tried to follow all CDC guidelines on testing, but that without a federal guideline on whether to count antibody tests with lab tests, Virginia looked to other states and followed their lead to include all the tests together. Chief of staff Clark Mercer defended the practice, saying ""we can't win"" because the state gets criticized for low testing numbers by not including something like serologic tests while other states include it and then gets criticized for including it when they try to be consistent with other states. Dr. Oliver then said they would look into listing the numbers separately each day. On Friday, the governor said he became aware of the situation on Monday, and, knowing that the FDA has found antibody tests to be less reliable than diagnostic tests, went to the health department and asked for the info to be separated out. Refining the system to display that information on the VDH website dashboard took several days to get the tool working properly, according to the governor. Essentially, diagnostic (or PCR) tests are the nasal swabs processed in labs to confirm a case of COVID-19. Antibody (or serology) tests test a person's blood for antibodies to COVID-19 to determine if they have had the virus. At the start of the pandemic, antibody tests were extremely rare, but more and more are being administered now. With Virginia's testing data separated, it shows about nine percent of the total tests have been antibody tests. But, Northam said, the key is that when the antibody tests are taken out of the number, the trends remain largely the same, with declining case averages and increasing test numbers. From this point forward, the testing data will be reported separately, especially as more antibody tests are approved by the FDA in the weeks to come. Testing capacity Governor Northam says Virginia has continued to make significant process on testing more people around the commonwealth, pointing to there being 58 public testing sites on April 21 and 215 as of Friday, with 52 more lined up next week. Those are in addition to standard testing sites. He thanked the cooperation of facilities from hospitals to free clinics to health departments and pharmacies, but did not mention the announcement he had hinted at earlier in the week about testing coming in partnership with Walmart. The start of Phase 1 Phase 1 of reopening Virginia has officially begun, and the governor reminded Virginians that it is a slight easing of restrictions. He has previously described it as turning a dimmer switch up slightly rather than flipping a light switch. This phase of reopening, which will last from two to four weeks, comes with the Stay at Home order shifting to a 'Safer at Home' order that asks Virginians who are most vulnerable to the virus to stay home and encourages all others that it's the safest option. Social gatherings of more than 10 are still prohibited and social distancing still needs to occur, per CDC guidelines. Teleworking is also still a strong recommendation, and the governor is strongly encouraging everyone to wear face masks in public, though not requiring it. He said his primary concern throughout the pandemic has been public health and said that reason is why he approved the requests from Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County, to delay entering Phase 1 by two weeks. Virginia's financial situation Governor Ralph Northam addressed the April 2020 Revenue Report that was released on Thursday, acknowledging that it was the first report to show a major loss in state revenue due to COVID-19. It recorded a 26.2% decrease in state revenue from April of 2019, which came out to around a $700 million decrease. By the end of June, Gov. Northam is predicting a $1 billion total loss for Virginia revenue. His finance secretary, Aubrey Layne, said the report wasn't all bad news though. He said payroll revenue was still up, showing that while the state has been impacted, economic activity has not shut down and many people have still been working. Layne also said that 20% of Virginia's revenue comes from sales tax, which stayed even for April, largely reflecting increased online sales and a lot of activity at large grocery stores. He also pointed to the substantial rise in sales at Virginia ABC stores. Layne said having a strong economy going into the pandemic has helped Virginia, but attributed much of the April reduction to state tax revenue that would normally be collected but was not this year, given the extension of tax deadlines. He highlighted a number of a ways the state is sending money to local governments, including around $650 million being distributed by the start of June to help with coronavirus response, as well as $121 million sent through the Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) to boost testing. Worker concerns Gov. Northam said his administration knows some employees will have concerns as businesses reopen and expand operations during Phase 1 and moving forward. The governor said anyone who feels their workplace is unsafe can contact the Department of Labor and Industry to report their workplace and make a complaint. As far as workers who are afraid to return to work because of medical reasons or underlying conditions in family members, the governor said the state is restricted by federal guidelines on unemployment insurance. Northam formally asked Virginia's Congressional delegation earlier this week to work to provide more flexibility in unemployment standards, but Congress has not yet acted on that. Northam said he's also instructed the Virginia Employment Commission (VEC) to provide flexibility if any worker can show their workplace is unsafe for them and that his cabinet will work to get them support. Local elections Noting that May's local elections are coming up this coming Tuesday, the governor encouraged all Virginians to vote absentee if possible. Moving forward Northam said easing restrictions ""does not mean we can behave like we used to."" Instead, it means a gradual reopening while people should stay at home as much as possible, wash their hands an increased amount, stay six feet away from others, and wear face coverings to protect themselves and others. Contact tracer hiring Health Commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver said the Virginia Department of Health is now in the final stages of their massive hiring effort to get 1,000 new contact tracers and is developing the onboarding plan for all of the new hires. Demographic discrepancies As usual in the state briefings, Dr. Oliver recapped the latest case statistics for Virginia, including the demographics of results. As of May 15, about 44% of all cases identified in Virginia have been among the Latino community and 23% of all cases among the African-American population. About 24% of deaths have been among black Virginians and 10% of deaths among Latino Virginians. The situation in prisons Secretary of Public Safety Brian Moran said the Virginia Department of Corrections has ""gone to extraordinary steps"" to protect the health and safety of inmates and correctional staff at Virginia's prisons. He highlighted a recent court ruling that dismissed an allegation of cruel and unusual punishment against Virginia correctional facilities, saying the judge's decision to toss that case shows the work they have done. When asked about the situation at Dillwyn Correctional Center, Moran said the reason they know there are so many cases there is because they were able to conduct point prevalence testing, as they've done at multiple facilities across Virginia and plan to do at more in the coming week. Asked about prisoners being on ""lockdown,"" he said it simply means that units are kept separate to reduce any potential spread of COVID-19 between different units in a prison, saying that's in the best interest of officers and offenders. Responding to a question about what went wrong at Dillwyn, he said ""nothing went wrong,"" pointing to their continued following of CDC guidelines. How will the regional approach continue with some areas delaying Phase 1? With Northern Virginia, Accomack County, and Richmond all not entering Phase 1 for at least two weeks, Gov. Northam said he's aware that granting requests from individual localities for their own approach goes against what he said earlier in the pandemic would not be a cohesive approach. However, on Friday, he said that the change came because the pandemic is ""a fluid situation"" with constantly changing data and information about the spread of the virus. ""Things change,"" Northam said, adding that that's his doctor's perspective. Since the data has progressed with some regions of Virginia not seeing the promising trends that others have seen, he said his team responded to local leaders' requests accordingly because local leaders know their area better. Asked about a request from some local leaders in the western side of Loudoun County, who asked to be able to enter Phase 1 on schedule and let the eastern side of the county delay, the governor said ""carving up counties"" and picking particular towns within counties would get out of hand be difficult for the public to follow. Northam also said picking out data for a particular small area without considering the larger area could show something that's not the full picture as well. He said his concentration is on public safety to keep Virginians and their families safe. Northam anticipates that numbers will continue improving, so long as everyone follows the guidelines, so that each of the areas with delays can move into Phase 1 soon. The Petersburg water situation On Monday, Gov. Northam said after outcry in the city of Petersburg as city officials shut off water to some residents amid the pandemic, the Virginia Department of Health issued a public health order requiring the city to restore water service to 45 homes and blocking the city from shutting anyone else's water off. On Friday, he answered a reporter's question, acknowledging that the situation was brought to his attention by a state delegate, but said the move was made because he believes all of Virginia has to come together to make sure everyone has access to running water. Law enforcement not enforcing the law The Culpeper County sheriff, who previously made headlines by vowing to deputize citizens in his county if Virginia[s General Assembly passed new gun laws during their session earlier this year, has said he will not enforce the regulations under Gov. Northam's executive order requiring certain business restrictions to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19. As of Friday, Culpeper County has 343 COVID-19 cases, 27 hospitalizations, and 5 deaths. Asked for his response, Northam simply said, ""I don't think that's a good idea, and we'll deal with that."" Asked if he sees the role of law enforcement as important to businesses navigating Phase 1 by enforcing violations if needed, the governor's response was ""Absolutely."" The briefing then moved on to the next question. In Virginia, local law enforcement and Virginia State Police can enforce the business restrictions and social gatherings rules set down in Executive Order 53 by issuing Class 1 misdemeanor citations. Protecting poll workers With local elections this Tuesday, May 19, Governor Ralph Northam said while he and his administration have encouraged absentee voting, they are using the Virginia Medical Reserve Corps and the National Guard to staff polling places that would normally be filled with volunteers at a vulnerable age to COVID-19, will be providing PPE to polling places, cleaning machines, implementing social distancing, and taking numerous measures to try to keep voting as safe it can be. ""Someone shouldn't have to choose between their health and voting,"" the governor said. He said that was the reason for his original request to move May's local elections to November, but the Virginia Senate chose not to vote on the measure after the House of Delegates approved it. ""So here we are,"" the governor said. He said he appreciates people abiding by guidelines and voting to keep democracy strong. Localized 7-day percent positivity data The city of Richmond officially requested localized data from the Virginia Department of Health this week that would break down the 7-day average of how many tests have come back positive each day. It's a key metric Northam has been using for the state as a whole, but was not previously available on local levels. As to why not, the governor said the VDH website is constantly being updated to report data sets in improved and clearer ways, and health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver said they are always looking to increase the diversity and granularity of data, like the map of cases by ZIP code released this week. State officials said they will keep adding new functionality to the state coronavirus dashboard because COVID-19 is a novel virus and more will keep being learned about the situation. The governor said the health department moved as quickly as possible to get a tool built to display the 7-day percent positivity average for all localities, though Richmond was the only locality making the request, and it's now available for all localities. Based on that newly available data, the governor said if any local government decides they need to implement more severe restrictions, they can request that like Richmond, Accomack County, and Northern Virginia did. Beaches and Memorial Day Virginia Beach has said that they're working on a comprehensive plan to potentially open up more activity on beaches by Memorial Day weekend. Gov. Northam said the city is working with state officials on that plan and that he'll be making an announcement, probably on Monday, about Virginia's beaches moving into Memorial Day. He said Virginia Beach's approach is to make sure everything is done safely, which he supports. What about regional hastening instead of delays? Governor Northam was asked if a count, for instance, has zero confirmed cases and wants to move into Phase 2 earlier than others, how he would respond to that request. He said ""we're open for that discussion"" but no decisions on the idea have been made yet. Response to the Legislative Black Caucus This week, the Legislative Black Caucus issued a statement against Phase 1 starting on May 15, saying that black people would be ""used as guinea pigs"" in the reopening plan. Gov. Northam said he appreciates and listens to the caucus' input and addressed some of the concerns they outlined in their letter to him, saying that his Health Equity Taskforce has been working to get more PPE into minority communities in places like Harrisonburg and Richmond. With testing as another major concerned outlined in their letter, he said that has also ramped up through the task force, alongside",0.0
1617297672,2020-05-26 14:20:46,Hong Kong leader says security law not a threat to freedoms,https://www.progress-index.com/ZZ/news/20200526/hong-kong-leader-says-security-law-not-threat-to-freedoms?rssfeed=true,en,True,,147801,progress-index.com,http://progress-index.com/,"HONG KONG (AP) "" Hong Kong's leader said Tuesday that national security legislation proposed by China's legislature will not threaten the semi-autonomous territory's civil rights, despite widespread criticism of the move as an encroachment on freedom of speech and assembly. The city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, told reporters that there was 'no need for us to worry"" over the move being considered by China's ceremonial National People's Congress. 'Hong Kong has proven that we uphold and preserve those values,"" Lam said. 'Hong Kong needs this piece of legislation for the bigger benefit of the great majority of Hong Kong people.' Lam also said that transit service would resume at Hong Kong's international airport on June 1, but that foreigners would still be banned from entering the city as part of measures to prevent a new wave of coronavirus infections. In Washington, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that President Donald Trump is ""displeased with China's efforts and that it's hard to see how Hong Kong can remain a financial hub, if China takes over.' She declined to elaborate when asked to explain the statement further. The move by China to pass the legislation signals the central government's determination to take greater control of Hong Kong after months of pro-democracy protests last year. Beijing has appointed new representatives in Hong Kong who follow the hard line laid down by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also the head of the ruling Communist Party. Such a move has long been under consideration and was hastened by last year's street protests in the former British colony, which was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing promised that the territory could retain its own relatively liberal civil, legal and economic systems that contrast starkly with the much more centrally controlled and authoritarian system in mainland China. Some 'foreign politicians' have 'expressed untrue opinions' about the plan to impose the law on Hong Kong, Lam said, without giving details. She repeated claims that the law would only target 'a minority,' citing concerns about terrorism and subversion. Protesters have returned to Hong Kong's streets to oppose the legislation, with thousands turning out on Sunday as police fired tear gas and deployed a water cannon to disperse the crowds. On Tuesday, over 100 protesters gathered at a luxury shopping mall in Hong Kong's Central business district, condemning Lam and her administration. The protests are a continuation of a monthslong pro-democracy movement that began last year and has at times descended into violence between police and demonstrators. Hong Kong's government is bound by Article 23 of the Basic Law "" its mini-constitution "" to enact laws to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against China. It proposed legislation to do so in 2003, but withdrew it after hundreds of thousands of people came out to protest. Beijing has increasingly pushed for measures such as punishment for disrespecting the Chinese national flag or anthem "" as often seen at soccer games "" along with a boost to pro-China patriotic-themed education in schools. However, opposition in Hong Kong's Legislative Council makes it unlikely a national security bill could pass at the local level, prompting Beijing to utilize what some describe as dubious legal grounds to force the measures through at the national level. The Chinese public is largely seen as backing Xi's tough approach to foreign policy challenges, including criticism from the U.S., Australia and others. Xi has made an unswerving line on national interests a key signature of his rule since taking over leadership of the ruling party in 2012. Abroad, however, that policy has further bolstered concerns about China's intentions to dominate markets and assert its influence in the Asia-Pacific region. That may ultimately add to Xi's difficulties in reviving economic growth and jobs at a time when global markets are partly shut due to the coronavirus pandemic and skepticism toward China runs high.",0.0

Washtenaw County Sheriff Jerry Clayton said several officers involved in the incident have been placed on administrative leave, including the one seen on the video punching the woman, and an internal investigation is underway. “There is absolutely no doubt, and no argument from me, that the images in the video are disturbing,” Clayton said. “It warrants a complete investigation.” About three dozen demonstrators marched outside the sheriff's department headquarters, chanting such things as “no justice, no peace” following the incident in Ypsilanti Township, about 40 miles west of Detroit. Authorities said the deputies took the action against Sha’Teina Grady El and her husband, Dan Grady El, after they ignored an order to leave the scene of a shooting as officers formed a perimeter to keep community members away from a potential shooter. “We cannot continue to allow this,” said Trische’ Duckworth, a protest organizer with the nonprofit Survivors Speak. The protesters later met with Clayton in his office. The sheriff’s department was called to scene on reports 30 people were arguing and shots had been fired. Upon arrival, the responding deputies found a 34-year-old female gunshot victim who required medical attention and several bystanders observing the scene, prompting a call to other police agencies for assistance. In his statement, Clayton said his office is investigating the use of force against the Grady Els and their arrests.

Hong Kong police massed outside the legislature complex Wednesday, ahead of debate on a bill that would criminalize abuse of the Chinese national anthem in the semi-autonomous city. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu) HONG KONG – Thousands of protesters shouted pro-democracy slogans and insults at police in Hong Kong on Wednesday as lawmakers debated a bill criminalizing abuse of the Chinese national anthem in the semi-autonomous city. Police massed outside the legislative building ahead of the session and warned protesters that if they did not disperse, they could be prosecuted. In the Central business district, police raised flags warning protesters to disperse before they shot pepper balls at the crowd and searched several people. More than 50 people in the Causeway Bay shopping district were rounded up and made to sit outside a shopping mall, while riot police with pepper spray patrolled and warned journalists to stop filming. In the Mong Kok district in Kowloon, some protesters set cardboard boxes and plastic on fire as demonstrations carried on into the night. The blaze was put out by firefighters. Across Hong Kong, 360 people were arrested on charges including unauthorized assembly, possession of items that could be used for unlawful purposes — such as gasoline bombs — to driving slowly and blocking traffic, according to Facebook posts by the Hong Kong police force. The bill would make it illegal to insult or abuse the Chinese national anthem, “March of the Volunteers” in semi-autonomous Hong Kong. Those guilty of the offense would face up to three years in prison and a fine of 50,000 Hong Kong dollars ($6,450). Opponents of the bill say it is a blow to freedom of expression in the city, while Beijing officials say it will foster a patriotic spirit and socialist values. “Western democracies all have laws to protect their national flags, national anthems and emblems. Any insulting acts toward these symbols would also be criminal,” pro-Beijing lawmaker Tony Tse said in the legislative debate. Tse said the bill would not affect human rights or force people to love the country or support any political power. “The purpose of this is to protect the dignity of a country,” he said. Pro-democracy lawmaker Charles Mok disagreed, saying the legislation would not help gain the respect of people and was an excuse to control freedom, speech and ideas of people. “We oppose the second reading of the national anthem bill, not because we don’t respect the national anthem. The national anthem is a symbol of the country's dignity. If it wants to be respected, then let this government first respect the rights and freedoms of its people first,"" Mok said. The debate over the anthem bill is expected to continue on Thursday. The bill was proposed in January 2019 after spectators from Hong Kong jeered at the anthem during high-profile international soccer matches in 2015. Last year, FIFA fined the Hong Kong Football Association after fans booed the national anthem at a World Cup qualifying game. Hong Kong was returned to China from British colonial rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” framework that promised freedoms not found on the mainland. Anti-China sentiment has risen as residents see Beijing moving to erode those rights. Mass protests in 2014, known as the Umbrella Revolution, followed the Chinese government’s decision to allow direct election of the city leader only after it screened candidates. In the end, the plan for direct elections was dropped. Legislation proposed in Hong Kong last year that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China for trials set off months of demonstrations that at times involved clashes between protesters and police. The legislation was withdrawn. China's ceremonial parliament now meeting in Beijing has moved to enact a national security law for Hong Kong aimed at forbidding secessionist and subversive activity, as well as foreign interference and terrorism. Hong Kong's own government has been unable to pass such legislation due to opposition in the city, and Beijing advanced the law itself after the protests last year. Asked about possible U.S. retaliation over the security legislation, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in Beijing that China would take necessary steps to fight back against what he called “erroneous foreign interference in Hong Kong’s affairs.”",0.0

(AP) "" Vowing not to back down after armed protesters gathered near his home and hung him in effigy, the governor of Kentucky on Tuesday condemned their use of 'fear and terror' in a demonstration fueled by coronavirus restrictions. Gov. Andy Beshear referred to the protesters as a mob in sharply condemning the weekend rally that spread to the Governor's Mansion, where his children play. And the Democratic governor bluntly accused some Kentucky politicians of culpability for attending a previous rally. 'Let's start by calling it what it was and what it is "" actions aimed at creating fear and terror,"" Beshear said of Sunday's rally. 'Crossing over barriers, standing on the other side of the glass from where I raise my kids and hanging me in an effigy, that's an action intended to use fear to get their way."" Beshear said he would not be deterred by the demonstration. He has stressed the need to reopen the state safely, phasing in business restarts amid the health crisis. Non-essential retail stores and restaurant dining rooms have been among the reopenings, though with restrictions meant to adhere to social distancing. Beshear also has strongly urged the wearing of masks. 'I will not be afraid,"" he said at his daily coronavirus briefing. 'I will not be bullied. And I will not back down, not to them and not to anybody else.' The effigy was hung in a tree near the State Capitol during what was billed as a protest rally in defense of constitutional rights, including the right to bear arms. The rally turned into a protest against coronavirus restrictions and Beshear's administration, according to media reports, with protesters chanting outside the Governor's Mansion for him to come outside. Beshear said Tuesday that the protesters have been 'embraced and emboldened' by some elected leaders. A handful of Republican lawmakers had attended a previous rally. Some prominent GOP leaders condemned the actions at Sunday's rally. Earlier Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced the protesters' actions as 'completely outrageous and unacceptable.' Without naming anyone, the governor urged elected officials to no longer 'cater"" to such groups, saying: 'You cannot fan the flames and then condemn the fire."" 'You can't wait until something nasty and horrible happens to then claim it's wrong while you've catered the support of certain groups for votes or other reasons,' he added. Beshear said he doesn't regret moving his wife and their two children to the Governor's Mansion, located across the street from the statehouse grounds, but said security measures will be reviewed. He wondered aloud how the protesters would react 'if someone else who is armed walked up on their patio?"""" 'They walked up and stood on the front porch, and there, just a window pane away from where my kids play, the mob chanted and heckled,"" Beshear said. 'Thankfully, my kids weren't there that day. But I want to remind you they are 9 and 10 years old.' Kentucky State Police had little to say Tuesday about the protest. 'The Kentucky State Police does not comment on the level of security provided to protect the governor, nor any inquiries that we receive regarding these efforts,' said Sgt. Josh Lawson, commander of the agency's public affairs branch, speaking with the Lexington Herald-Leader. Beshear, the son of a former Kentucky governor, is known for his disciplined, even-keeled style. But he let his emotions show when pressed by reporters about the incident. 'I'm not going to let a bunch of jerks change the way that we're living our life,"" he said. Beshear made another statement about the protest during his briefing. Each day, he takes time to learn a few more words of sign language from a sign language interpreter. On Tuesday, the lesson he signed was: Love, not hate. ___ Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak",0.0

Four Minneapolis officers involved in the arrest of the black man who died in police custody were fired Tuesday, hours after a bystanders video showed an officer kneeling on the handcuffed mans neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving. (Richard Tsong-Taatarii/Star Tribune via AP) MINNEAPOLIS – The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges against the white police officer seen on video kneeling against the neck of a handcuffed black man who complained that he could not breathe and died in police custody. Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving. “I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white. He later added: ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired — an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. Conflict erupted again Wednesday at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police. News helicopter video appeared to show looting of nearby stores, including a Target, a Cub Foods and an auto parts store, with no evident police intervention. Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door. Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete. Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests. “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department's culture. “One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said. The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota’s two top law enforcement officials — Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black — promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn't endorse the mayor’s call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out. “I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it’s important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,” Ellison said. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd's death had “outraged us and people across the country” and that the case “deserves the best we can give.” The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. Floyd’s death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others. Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis “a very, very sad event"" and said his administration was going to “look at it.” Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited. Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd's death was “part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country” and ""cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.” It also “sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,"" Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, ""but I don’t think that’s enough.” A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally. Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told the AP. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store. It was unclear why Floyd was arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks. A Minneapolis Fire Department report shows that paramedics moved Floyd from the scene, and two fire crew members got into the ambulance to help. Medics were doing chest compressions and other lifesaving measures on an “unresponsive, pulseless male,” the report said. Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital. An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to his death. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. Chauvin's attorney confirmed the officer's identity on Tuesday. The department identified the other officers Wednesday as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. In calling for charges, the mayor contrasted Floyd's death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers. “We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,"" Frey said. ""There’s somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes — every one of which that officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd's neck.” ___ Long reported from Washington.

The disturbing video of Monday night's death — during which a white officer's knee was planted firmly on George Floyd's neck and his desperate calls for help were ignored — has prompted protests in the Minnesota city and demands for charges for the officers involved. At a news conference Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to ""act on the evidence before him"" and press charges on the arresting officer. ""Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail? If you had done it or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now. And I cannot come up with a good answer to that question,"" Frey told a news conference Wednesday. ""We watched for five whole excruciating minutes as a white officer firmly pressed his knee into the neck of an unarmed, handcuffed black man,"" he added, noting that the arresting officer was not practicing a technique condoned by the city's police. ""I saw no threat; I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary."" Frey refrained from specifying what charges he would like to see, citing a desire not to impede investigators. But Floyd's sister Bridgett went one step further on national television earlier Wednesday. ""I would like for those officers to be charged with murder because that's exactly what they did,"" she told the Today show. ""They murdered my brother; he was crying for help."" She said the family, which has retained legal representation, is far from satisfied with the announcement that the four officers in the video have been fired — a swift decision that Frey said was ""the right call."" The Minneapolis Police Department has not publicly confirmed the officers' identities, and it said the FBI is also investigating the circumstances of Floyd's death. The announcement also failed to satisfy protesters who on Tuesday evening thronged to the department's 3rd Precinct, where clashes erupted between demonstrators and law enforcement in riot gear. As Minnesota Public Radio reported, the demonstrators damaged the building and a squad car in a confrontation that eventually saw police firing tear gas into the crowd. ""What we witnessed today was state-sponsored murder, a state-sponsored execution,"" Steven Belton, president of the nonprofit Urban League Twin Cities, said at a gathering of local civil rights leaders earlier Tuesday outside City Hall. ""And what we await to see is whether it's going to become state-sanctioned execution. It'll be sanctioned if nothing is done."" The controversy engulfing Minneapolis is not unfolding in a vacuum. Already a video recorded earlier this year in Georgia — depicting the death of an unarmed black man, who was followed and shot by two white men while out for a jog three months ago — has renewed questions about the conduct of local police, who did not arrest the men until after the video surfaced this month. And this week, a recorded encounter in New York City's Central Park caught fire after it was posted to social media. In the video, a white woman calls the police on a black man, who says he had simply asked her to leash her dog while he was out bird-watching. ""He's recording me and threatening me and my dog,"" she tells emergency operators multiple times as the man recording her keeps his distance. After the video surfaced, the woman was fired by her employer, the investment firm Franklin Templeton. The video recorded in Minneapolis more closely called to mind an earlier death in New York City, however. Like Eric Garner, who died after an officer's chokehold in 2014, Floyd's final words before he appeared to lose consciousness were a plea for help: ""I can't breathe."" Floyd is seen wailing the phrase several times with his face planted on the pavement, his hands apparently cuffed behind his back and a male officer kneeling on his neck. Observers standing nearby are heard telling officers that Floyd's nose was bleeding and that he was dying. The officer and his colleagues show little reaction as the man gradually goes silent. The officer does not lift his weight off Floyd's neck throughout most of the video until medical workers arrive to lift him into an ambulance on a stretcher. The New York City police officer who used the chokehold on Garner, Daniel Pantaleo, was never charged with a crime but was fired last year on a judge's recommendation. The Floyd family's attorney emphasized the link with Garner in comments Wednesday to the Today show. ""It's worse than Eric Garner in many ways,"" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said, ""because you hear the people even pleading with them, 'Please get your knee off his neck. Have some humanity; this is a human being,' "" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement Tuesday, ""There must be a complete and thorough outside investigation into what occurred, and those involved in this incident must be held accountable. Justice must be served for this man and his family, justice must be served for our community, and justice must be served for our country."" ",0.0

""After careful study of developments over the reporting period, I certified to Congress today that Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under United States laws in the same manner as U.S. laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997,"" Pompeo said in a statement released Wednesday. ""No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground."" The secretary announced his decision at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China. President Trump has blamed Chinese authorities for failing to prevent the coronavirus from becoming a global pandemic, noting that his administration is ""not going to take it lightly."" And earlier this month the Senate trained its legislative fire on China, with a unanimously passed bill that could force some foreign companies off U.S. stock exchanges. The State Department also has pushed back hard against China's recent plans for an aggressive new security law that would criminalize behavior in Hong Kong seen as critical of Beijing. In a statement shortly after news of the proposed legislation surfaced, Pompeo called it ""a death knell for the high degree of autonomy."" For more than two decades, the semiautonomous region has been governed under a principle Beijing calls ""one country, two systems,"" which allows Hong Kong certain freedoms from the communist economic and legal systems practiced on mainland China. Partly for that reason, the U.S. treats Hong Kong as separate from the rest of China as long as the city remains sufficiently autonomous. But the relationship between Beijing and Hong Kong's residents has grown increasingly fraught in recent years, with the city periodically erupting into massive demonstration against what protesters and the U.S. call Beijing's attempts to encroach on its freedoms. The region again saw clashes between protesters and riot police last weekend. One of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, Joshua Wong, urged leaders abroad to reconsider whether its ""special trade status can still be held since, once the law is implemented, Hong Kong will be assimilated into China's authoritarian regime, on both rule of law and human rights protections."" Now, that status appears in jeopardy with the Trump administration's reappraisal. ""Hong Kong and its dynamic, enterprising and free people have flourished for decades as a bastion of liberty, and this decision gives me no pleasure,"" Pompeo said Wednesday. ""But sound policymaking requires a recognition of reality. While the United States once hoped that free and prosperous Hong Kong would provide a model for authoritarian China, it is now clear that China is modeling Hong Kong after itself.""

Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin’s suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door. Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd’s family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete. Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests. “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department’s culture. “One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said. The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota’s two top law enforcement officials — Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black — promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn’t endorse the mayor’s call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out. “I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it’s important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,” Ellison said. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd’s death had “outraged us and people across the country” and that the case “deserves the best we can give.” The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. Floyd’s death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others. Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis “a very, very sad event” and said his administration was going to “look at it.” Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited. Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd’s death was “part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country” and “cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.” It also “sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,” Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, “but I don’t think that’s enough.” A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally. Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told the AP. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store. It was unclear why Floyd was arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks. A Minneapolis Fire Department report shows that paramedics moved Floyd from the scene, and two fire crew members got into the ambulance to help. Medics were doing chest compressions and other lifesaving measures on an “unresponsive, pulseless male,” the report said. Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital. An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to his death. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. Chauvin’s attorney confirmed the officer’s identity on Tuesday. The department identified the other officers Wednesday as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. In calling for charges, the mayor contrasted Floyd’s death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers. “We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,” Frey said. “There’s somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes — every one of which that officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd’s neck.” ___ Long reported from Washington.

Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted for calm early Thursday. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. He also asked for the public’s help in keeping the peace.

Protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody Monday, broke out in Minneapolis for a third straight night. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) MINNEAPOLIS – Cheering protesters torched a Minneapolis police station Thursday that the department was forced to abandon as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck. A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel"" shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket and cheering. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request, but it wasn’t immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was “here with the Minneapolis Fire Department” to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley's “Redemption Song."" Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd's death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd's death. ""It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property ""because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday's, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city’s response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. “If the strategy was to keep residents safe — it failed,” City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. “Prevent property damage — it failed."" On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.",0.0

They chanted for justice in Memphis. They stopped freeway traffic in Los Angeles. The death of George Floyd continued to ripple across the U.S. on Wednesday night as the calls became louder for the arrest of the white police officer who knelt on his neck for several minutes in a horrifying video that spread across social media this week. Meanwhile on Thursday, Ben Crump, attorney for Floyd's family, warned any instigators of violence in the Minneapolis protests: ""We don't need that. We need people focused on getting justice,"" he said. He is calling for an independent autopsy, saying he doesn't trust the city of Minneapolis. ""They offered him no humanity while keeping his knee on his neck. Members of the public were the only ones trying to de-escalate the situation. Not the police,"" Crump told CNN on Thursday. ""Keeping the knee on the neck for over 8 minutes – that is unconscionable."" While hundreds of protesters took to the streets, police chiefs from coast to coast expressed their outrage with Floyd's death. ""Do not defend the undefendable, attempt to justify the unjustifiable or excuse the inexcusable,"" Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina said on Twitter. ""George Floyd should be alive today."" ""The lack of compassion, use of excessive force, or going beyond the scope of the law, doesn't just tarnish our badge – it tears at the very fabric of race relations in this country,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said in a statement posted to Twitter. Minneapolis: Police, protesters clash; looters raid Target, Dollar Tree, other stores Protests in Minneapolis devolved into chaos on Wednesday night. Reports of fires came from around the city and videos of looters inside of stores quickly spread on social media. Several people shared video of people taking products from a local Target. A Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an AutoZone store also showed signs of damage and looting, and windows of businesses in nearby strip malls were reported to be smashed out. At least one person was killed. Police spokesman John Elder told USA TODAY that the department was investigating a homicide near the area where a reporter from the Star Tribune newspaper tweeted that a looter had been shot and killed by a pawn shop owner. One person was in custody early Thursday, the Star Tribune reported, but police wouldn't confirm if the victim was a looter. “The facts of what led up to the shooting are still being sorted out. We are truly in the infancy of this investigation,” Elder said. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Memphis: George Floyd's death was 'nail in the unfortunate coffin for America' A silent demonstration to protest the death of Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, turned into verbal confrontations with Memphis police and counter-protesters. The rally began with about 40 people holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop killing black people” and “Silence is violence.” Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice, no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up. Within an hour, however, the protesters were met by two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. Theryn C. Bond, a prominent local activist and former Memphis City Council candidate, confronted the counter-protesters, who occasionally jeered at the crowd to ""go out for a jog"" — a reference to Aubrey's slaying. ""I was so impressed to see so many white allies,"" Bond said. ""Because sometimes we think, 'Everybody doesn't get it.' And I think with the recent murder of George Floyd by police... I think this was the proverbial nail in the unfortunate coffin for America to really understand what we mean when we say, 'Black Lives Matter.'"" Floyd's death this week is the latest in a string of violence against black people. Taylor was shot and killed in her Kentucky home by officers executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant, while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging after being pursued by two white men who later said they thought he was a burglary suspect.

Demonstrators gathered in the late afternoon on downtown streets and, eventually, dozens of them moved onto U.S. 101 despite police efforts to keep them from walking into the lanes. When a CHP patrol car arrived, demonstrators surrounded it. The car's window was smashed and it jerked forward and moved away with several protesters who had jumped onto the hood. Television news footage showed one man finally hopping or jumping from the side of the moving car and then flopping onto the ground. A second CHP car arrived and was attacked, with one demonstrator hurling what appeared to be a wooden skateboard through the back window before it moved off. At its rally's peak, hundreds of people gathered outside the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice. The demonstration was mostly peaceful and no arrests were immediately made, Los Angeles police Officer Mike Lopez said. Contributing: Corinne S. Kennedy, Micaela A.

Gretchen Whitmer's COVID-19 emergency orders. The orders include a ban on barbers and hair salons doing business during the declared crisis. Manke's refusal to follow the Democratic governor's shutdown order sparked a May 20 demonstration in front of the Michigan Capitol. Dozens of barbers and hairstylists openly defied the order with free haircuts. The Michigan State Police issued seven citations at the demonstration. Manke's attorney argued, among other things, that the order to pull his barber's license and close his shop violated his First Amendment right to protest the reach of the governor's executive orders. The Court of Appeals disagrees: ""Here, the State has an important governmental interest in containing the spread of COVID-19,"" the decision reads, then continues to say that the governor's executive order is ""directed at that interest and not at any speech or expressive conduct."" The majority decision said Shiawassee Circuit Court Judge Matthew Stewart should have granted the state's request to enforce the shutdown order and that he should not second-guess the actions of Whitmer and her experts as they try to manage a public health crisis. Manke could appeal the decision to the Michigan Supreme Court, but, in the meantime, his license remains suspended. One appeals court judge, Brock Swartzle, issued a partial dissent from two other judges on the panel who made the decision. Within minutes of the decision going public, Swartzle announced he is seeking the Republican nomination to run for a seat on the Michigan Supreme Court. ",0.0

Barbers and hair stylists are protesting the state's stay-at-home orders, a defiant demonstration that reflects how salons have become a symbol for small businesses that are eager to reopen two months after the COVID-19 pandemic began. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) DETROIT – A Michigan court on Thursday ordered a barber to close his shop and stop defying the state's coronavirus restrictions, though he vowed to keep cutting hair. The Michigan appeals court overturned a decision by a Shiawassee County judge and directed him to sign an injunction sought by state regulators. Karl Manke, 77, said he's not backing down. He told The Associated Press that he got the news while cutting someone's hair and he doesn't intend to comply with it. “I could care less,” he said by phone from his shop in Owosso, about 70 miles northwest of Detroit. “If they want to put me in jail, put me in jail. ... I will be governed — fair governing — but not ruled. This is a police state action.” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has kept barbershops and hair salons closed for weeks, citing a high risk of virus transmission as stylists cut hair and people wait for their turn. “Uncontroverted evidence clearly revealed that COVID-19 is a highly communicable illness,” the appeals court said in a 2-1 decision. “Uncontroverted evidence revealed that COVID-19 is spread by infected persons showing no symptoms that could serve to warn others of the possibility of infection.” Manke's attorney, David Kallman, later asked the Michigan Supreme Court to intervene. Manke reopened his shop on May 4, saying he needed to make money and declaring that the “government is not my mother.” He has been ticketed for violating Whitmer's orders. Separate from the court case, he's had his shop and barber's licenses suspended. Nonetheless, customers have traveled from all over the state to get a haircut and endorse his defiance. Manke gave free haircuts last week during a protest at the state Capitol. Texas hair salon owner Shelley Luther, who was briefly jailed for opening her shop, appeared at a rally outside Manke's business. Elsewhere in Michigan, state regulators inspected Ardor and Grit Salon in Holland, according to the Mackinac Center Legal Foundation. The owner, Sarah Huff, participated in the Capitol protest, and her shop has been open since May 15. “She needs to make a living and she believes she can do so safely,” attorney Patrick Wright said. In Springfield, Missouri, Great Clips salons were temporarily closed after receiving threatening messages. Two hairstylists who tested positive for the coronavirus might have exposed 140 clients to the illness. ___ Check out more of the AP’s coronavirus coverage at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak ___ Follow Ed White at https://twitter.com/edwhiteap",0.0
1619496785,2020-05-28 18:29:06,Trump tries a new response after George Floyd's death,https://www.wsls.com/news/politics/2020/05/28/trump-tries-a-new-response-after-george-floyds-death/,en,False,,90694,wsls.com,http://www.wsls.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON – It was the kind of personal statement expected from a president in response to the disturbing video of a black man gasping for help as a white policeman pinned him to the street by the neck. But it was a very different tone for President Donald Trump, who has often been silent in the face of white-on-black violence and has a long history of defending police. “I feel very, very badly,"" Trump said Thursday of George Floyd's death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. ""That’s a very shocking sight.” Once more likely to hew to the “blue lives matter” mantra, Trump and his allies are questioning an officer’s conduct and calling for justice for Floyd. But some activists doubt that Trump has suddenly evolved on the issue of police brutality and instead see election-year political calculations. “This is the first race-tinged case that I’ve ever heard him address” as president, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and Trump critic who has known the president for decades. “So therefore he cannot be upset when people feel that it’s empty words because it is so out of character.” White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump was taking the death seriously. “This has nothing to do with politics and is only about making sure justice is done, and anyone who suggests otherwise is only seeking to sow division and ignore the President’s unwavering support for the African-American community,” Deere said, citing Trump’s support for criminal justice reform legislation, Opportunity Zones and historically black colleges and universities. Trump has been silent on a number of high-profile police-involved killings, including that of Stephon Clark, a black man shot by Sacramento police in 2018. “This is something that is a local matter and that’s something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities,” then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time. He has never addressed the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold by police trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes. Video of the encounter was viewed millions of times online and Garner’s dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has, however, invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect. Trump has a long history of injecting himself into racially sensitive cases. In 1989, he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of a brutal assault on a jogger. Trump has never apologized, telling reporters last year: “You have people on both sides of that.” Trump also spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And he has even appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. But Trump's tone has changed in recent weeks as he has repeatedly expressed dismay at footage of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man fatally shot in February in Georgia while jogging. “You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends,"" he told reporters this month. ""It’s a heartbreaking thing.” The president has notably left open the possibility of some other explanation, saying: “it could be something that we didn’t see on tape."" Trump and his allies have been even clearer on the death of Floyd, who can be heard and seen on tape pleading that he couldn't breathe before he slowly stops talking and moving. Trump “was very upset when he saw that video,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. “He wants justice to be served.” Trump's conservative allies also rallied to the cause. Fox News host Sean Hannity said he is ""a big supporter of law enforcement,"" but expressed outrage Wednesday night, telling his audience: “The lack of training here is breathtaking.” “It defies common sense. It defies training. It defies arrest policies and procedures. There was no resistance,” echoed Bernie Kerik, the former New York police commissioner pardoned by Trump. “We got to get to the very bottom of how this poor individual was treated, and the death of him on the video itself is shocking from what I saw,” said Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Even conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who once called Black Lives Matter a “terrorist group,” said Thursday that Floyd’s death was totally “unjustified” and he was “so mad.” The outpouring comes as the Trump campaign has sought to chip into the advantage Democrats have with black voters. The campaign hopes either to win enough black support to keep pivotal states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in play or minimize enthusiasm for Democratic rival Joe Biden. There could be a small window after Biden last week told a prominent black radio host that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black,” a gaffe he later said he regretted. Trump and his allies have seized on that and other Biden statements, even though Biden, who served as vice president under the nation’s first black president, remains deeply popular among black voters, who helped him secure the Democratic nomination. Indeed, a recent Fox News poll found that just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, versus 75% who have a favorable view of Biden. Chris White, the longtime director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, questioned the sincerity of Republicans’ response to the deaths of Arbery and Floyd. The White House and Department of Justice have long had the power to address these issues. “Any time we hear politicians speaking about dealing with police brutality in the middle of election year, it’s just meaningless rhetoric that has a hollow promise,"" he said. Sharpton credited both the magnitude of outrage in response to Floyd's death as well as the upcoming election for the changed approach. But he doubted many black voters will be swayed with an approach they may see as too little, too late. “It's like a father that misses a kid’s graduation of high school, graduation of college,"" he said. “He can't be upset when the kid looks at him suspiciously when he's there when he graduates with his Ph.D."" ___ Associated Press writer Kat Stafford in Detroit contributed to this report.",0.0

Violent protests over the death of the black man in police custody broke out in Minneapolis for a second straight night Wednesday, with protesters in a standoff with officers outside a police precinct and looting of nearby stores. (Carlos Gonzalez/Star Tribune via AP) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Cheering protesters torched a Minneapolis police station Thursday that the department was forced to abandon as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck. A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket and cheering. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request, but it wasn’t immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was “here with the Minneapolis Fire Department” to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city’s response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. “If the strategy was to keep residents safe — it failed,” City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. “Prevent property damage — it failed.” On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.",0.0

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) DENVER – Protesters swarmed Denver on Thursday, blocking traffic and smashing vehicles while running from gunfire and police tear gas after a demonstration against the death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody turned violent. Hundreds of demonstrators stood in the downtown streets and chanted as darkness fell outside the Colorado State Capitol, where protesters spray-painted graffiti and broke car windows. In other areas of downtown Denver, police in riot gear fired gas canisters, used rubber bullets and walked in a phalanx through the streets to drive protesters away. The protest briefly spilled over onto Interstate 25, blocking all lanes of traffic until police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. The protests continued into the night, despite Denver Mayor Michael Hancock pleading for calm. “I certainly understand everyone’s frustration and sense of pain and disgust following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis,” he said in a video posted on Twitter. “But I want to plead to everyone. Let’s demonstrate, but let’s demonstrate peacefully. Leave the weapons home.” Earlier in the protest, gunfire outside the state Capitol sent people running for cover. Gary Cutler, a spokesman for the Colorado State Patrol, said the shots were fired in a park across the street. Most of the protesters already had left the area and were marching downtown. Cutler said the Capitol building was locked down, and everyone inside was safe. No injuries have been reported from the shots. State Rep. Leslie Herod, who was protesting at the Capitol, tweeted, “We just got shot at."" She later said, ""We will not be deterred by this unspeakable act of violence.” Police spokesman Kurt Barnes said it's unclear if the protesters were being targeted, and no one has been arrested. About six or seven shots were fired, he said. Several hundred protesters had gathered to call for justice following the death of Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Monday after an officer knelt on his neck for almost eight minutes. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Some among the Denver protesters carried signs reading “Black Lives Matter” and chanted, “Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Racist police got to go.” Aerial footage showed several protesters smashing the windows out of at least two vehicles parked outside the Capitol, and others spray-painted graffiti on the Capitol steps. A cellphone video shot by protester Anabel Escobar, 29, showed a man on the hood of an SUV making its way through the crowd in front of the Capitol. The video showed the driver speeding up and then apparently trying to run the man over after he fell off the hood. The vehicle sped away as other protesters chased it. It was unclear if the man on the hood was injured. Gov. Jared Polis said Thursday night he was “absolutely shocked” by the video. “Coloradans are better than this,” he said. “I share the immense anguish we all feel about the unjust murder of George Floyd. But let me be clear, senseless violence will never be healed by more violence.” As the protest started, The Denver Police Department tweeted a message from Chief Paul Pazen sending condolences to Floyd’s family and saying the city's officers do not use the tactics employed by the Minneapolis officers. He called that type of force “inexcusable.” Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired, and the mayor has called for the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck to be criminally charged. The death has led to violent protests in Minneapolis and demonstrations in other cities, including Los Angeles.",0.0

In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd can be seen pleading that he can’t breathe as Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneels on his neck. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities were boarding up their windows and doors Thursday in an effort to prevent looting, with the Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the police's 3rd Precinct, the focus of the protests, broke into a punk version of Bob Marley's “Redemption Song."" Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Earlier Thursday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called in the National Guard to try to stem the violence. Floyd's death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchinson said the rally had been peaceful and there had been no arrests by late evening. The governor’s order did not say how many Guard members were mobilized or whether they would be in service Thursday night. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd's death. ""It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property ""because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday's, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city’s response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. “If the strategy was to keep residents safe — it failed,” City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. “Prevent property damage — it failed."" On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. But Eric Kowalczyk, a police captain in Baltimore during the Freddie Gray riots in 2015, generally supported the Minneapolis police strategy to avoid confrontations with protesters when possible, saying heavy-handed police responses are only met with more violence. “Nobody wants to see their city on fire, but at the same time, you don’t want to see citizens injured by the very police department they are protesting,” he said. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard.",0.0

Northam says earliest Virginia will enter Phase 2 is June 5,https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Gov-Northam-addresses-Virginia-with-mask-order-taking-effect-on-Friday-570836371.html,en,False,,658838,State News - United States - Virginia,http://www.virginia.statenews.net/,"Note: This article appears extremely long. That's because it includes previous updates from Gov. Northam's briefings throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest updates always come just below our introduction that overviews the current situation in Virginia. Headers indicate the date of each update, and you can search for updates from any past briefings by searching the date, like ""May 11."" Governor Ralph Northam addressed the commonwealth on Thursday for his latest COVID-19 briefing as Virginians prepare for his latest executive order to require wearing face coverings inside businesses, which takes effect on Friday, May 29. Friday will also mark two weeks since the start of Phase 1 of Northam's 'Forward Virginia' plan for reopening. On Thursday, the governor said the earliest Virginia will enter Phase 2 is Friday, June 5. While the governor's briefings were previously held on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, from Memorial Day onward, they're being held on Tuesdays and Thursdays, unless a special one is called. On Tuesday, in addition to announcing the new mask order for the commonwealth, Gov. Northam addressed criticism for not wearing a mask on his Virginia Beach visit, said that the areas still in Phase 0 would enter Phase 1 on Friday, and announced new workplace regulations under development, among other topics covered. You can find detailed breakdowns of previous press conferences farther down on this page, under the headers for their respective dates. Most of Virginia began Phase 1 on May 15, except for Northern Virginia, which received a 2-week extension to Phase 0 a few days before the start, and Richmond and Accomack County, which each requested and received similar 2-week extensions just hours before the official start of Phase 1. Now, those areas will join the rest of Virginia in Phase 1 on May 29. According to the governor, Phase 1 will last at least two weeks, and how data trends on Virginia's COVID-19 tests, hospital bed capacity, and PPE supplies will determine when the commonwealth can move to Phase 2. As of Thursday morning's latest COVID-19 numbers for Virginia, testing remains generally higher across Virginia and the 'percent positivity' rate of how many Virginians are testing positive for COVID-19 has been steadily decreasing over time. Northam has said that the restrictions in Phase 1 established by his administration are ""the floor"" and that it's up to individual businesses whether they are able to safely reopen and individual regions can request changes if their data is different from the state's overall. As of May 28, Virginia has 41,401 total cases of COVID-19, including confirmed lab tests and clinical diagnoses, with 1,338 total deaths and 4,442 cumulative hospitalizations. According to the Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association, there are currently 1,502 Virginians hospitalized with either confirmed COVID-19 tests or pending COVID-19 test results and 5,472 patients who were hospitalized and have recovered. In general, over the past three weeks, test results have yielded lower daily case totals and increased testing, showing the ""curve"" of Virginia cases moving downward. But the commonwealth is still working to overcome an earlier backlog in testing and catch up to the national average of how much of the population has been tested, although state health officials say their focus is getting tests to the most vulnerable and most affected people. You can watch each of the governor's briefings through WHSV's livestream at whsv.com/livestream2 or on the WHSV News app. That livestream can also be watched through our Roku and Amazon Fire apps. You'll also be able to watch it live in the video player above during the briefing. The latest updates from Gov. Northam's May 28 briefing Governor Ralph Northam began Thursday's briefing by addressing the grim milestone marked on Wednesday, which was when the Johns Hopkins University tally of deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 surpassed 100,000. The governor said it;s important to remember that every statistic connected to the coronavirus isn't just a number but a person – someone with loved ones and friends. Northam said those numbers are why Virginians need to keep working to protect each other amid the pandemic. Anniversary of Virginia Beach shooting But this weekend also marks another tragic milestone, as Sunday will be one year since the Virginia Beach shooting in which 12 people lost their lives and four others' lives were forever altered by injuries. The governor said no in-person events will be held this year to remember the somber anniversary, but that grieving is not an event, but a process. A pandemic cannot stop the remembrance of the lives lost, he said, and he read aloud a list of the names of the victims one-by-one, followed by a moment of silence. Northam also thanked the Virginia Beach community for rallying to support each other after the deadly day, mentioning coworkers, first responders, friends, neighbors, and everyone who is a part of the Virginia Beach community. Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County As of Friday, May 29, Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County, which each had their entry into Phase 1 delayed by two weeks, will officially join the rest of Virginia in Phase 1, putting all of the commonwealth on the same guidelines. With major portions of the state population first entering the new phase, the governor reviewed the guidelines, which include restaurants open to outdoor seating at 50% capacity, salons and barber shops open with strict limits, and more. You can find the full list of guidelines in the ’Forward Virginia’ plan. Northam reiterated a statement he's made many times, which is that ""just because a business is allowed to open doesn't mean that it must open,"" if any business owners are not comfortable reopening yet. Face coverings and you With the new mask order beginning on Friday, Gov. Northam recapped that every Virginia, unless part of the limited exceptions list, should be prepared with a face covering. He said they don't need to be elaborate, again pointing to simple coverings like bandannas or online DIY instructions, and thanked the Virginians who have sent his office face coverings. The reason, he reminded everyone, is because as more has been learned about how COVID-19 spreads, the CDC says masks are a great help in limiting the virus' transmission, blocking droplets and aerosols from yourself that could infect others. Northam made the comparison that if you shouldn't go into a public place without shoes or a shirt, you shouldn't go in without a face covering. He also showed a new promotional graphic unveiled by the Virginia Department of Health encouraging customers to wear masks that is being sent to businesses across Virginia. But what about enforcement? One of the biggest questions that's been posed since Northam's announcement of the mask order earlier this week is how exactly it will be enforced. The governor had said on Tuesday that it would be the authority of the health department and not a matter for law enforcement, but the health department explained on Wednesday that they can use court orders against businesses that refuse to comply with a Class One misdemeanor. Rita Davis, counsel to the governor, came to the podium on Thursday, to explain that in more detail. Davis said the enforcement is a statutory process by which all public health orders are enforced and that it's been the standard included in all five public health orders issued so far in the pandemic. It was not created specifically for the mask order and is not new, she emphasized. As the standard enforcement mechanism established under Virginia's health code, she said it provides two ways for the health commissioner to enforce the order: by a civil order to obtain an injunction against a non-compliant business or by a warrant through a magistrate for a misdemeanor charge. Davis said those are the procedures made available for any enforcement, but they're reserved only for ""gross and repeated"" violations. She said the state government is not expecting business owners to enforce the order, but instead encourages them to educate their patrons about the importance of wearing a mask. While not the responsibility of the business owner, she said it shouldn't be the responsibility of the health department or law enforcement either to make sure you're wearing a face covering, but the personal responsibility of each Virginian as the right thing to do to protect their families and fellows Virginians. So can a business refuse service to someone who refuses to wear a mask? Davis encouraged business owners to use the opportunity to have a discussion with any non-compliant individual, but said business do have the right to ask a patron to return at a different time ""when they're more convinced they should be wearing a mask."" Asked by a reporter for more information later, Gov. Northam said the intent of the mask order is to ""do the right thing"" and take care of people around you, not to lock anyone up in jail. He said, as a business owner, he would nicely ask someone who's not wearing a mask if they would mind wearing one for the safety of the people in his office. While not wanting businesses to be in the practice of enforcing the order to avoid causing any confrontations, he asked people to just think of others and wear a mask for their benefit. Asked for more clarity about what the health department will do, Counsel Davis said if a person repeatedly refuses to wear a mask, rather than a business enforcing it themselves, they would report the incident to the Virginia Department of Health, which could take action as needed. The only situation in which she foresees law enforcement involvement is if a confrontation evolves between a patron refusing to wearing a mask and an employee, but at that point, law enforcement is not there because of someone not wearing a mask, but because of a confrontation between a patron and an employee. Okay, but what about people who say they meet one of the exceptions to the mask requirement listed in the executive order? Governor Northam said that business will have to rely on a person's word if they say they meet an exception. Again using his medical office as an example, he said if someone explained that they had COPD and so couldn't wear a cloth mask, he would accept that explanation and encourage them to continue social distancing. Phase 1 for at least another week Governor Northam announced on Thursday that all of Virginia will remain Phase 1 for another week at a minimum, with June 5 the earliest that the commonwealth can enter Phase 2. While all of the trends for COVID-19 are heading down in the state, especially percent positivity, and testing capacity and PPE supplies are increasing, he said it's simply too soon to determine when Virginia can begin Phase 2 because of the incubation period of the virus. It can take up to two weeks for someone with infected with COVID-19 to begin showing symptoms, so Northam said there's no feasible way to move into Phase 2 yet while relying on the data, but that his administration will continue to monitor moving forward. CVS offering testing Northam also announced on Thursday that 39 CVS pharmacies across Virginia will start offering testing using self-swab kits while staff members monitor the use of the test. However, the closest location to the Shenandoah Valley offering it will be in Charlottesville. Northam's testing The governor said he intends to get tested for the virus soon. He said on Tuesday that he hoped to get tested at one of the health department's community testing events, but he has not provided any specifics on that yet. Virginia's beaches After Virginia Beach reopen to recreational use last weekend, Governor Northam says his visit to the beach was to check how their comprehensive plan was working. Saying that it worked, Virginia's other public beaches will be able to reopen to recreational activity this Friday, with restrictions in place similar to Virginia Beach's plan, including no group sports, no tents, no alcohol allowed, and more. ""People can be safe while enjoying our beautiful beaches,"" Northam said. Racing is back The governor also announced on Thursday that Virginia is allowing NASCAR and horse races to resume single-day events on Friday. Any races held in Virginia will not be open to the public and no spectators will be allowed, but because the competitors are in open air events with spacing between the participants, Northam said his administration determined there's minimum risk of spread as long as fans are not present. He pointed to that move as a step to help Virginia's economic recovery as well. More business news Gov. Northam highlighted this week's announcement that Microsoft is launching a new technology hub in northern Virginia, which he said should bring 1,500 new jobs to the commonwealth. Saying that Virginia is glad to have all those jobs, Northam said people should expect more big job announcements in the next few days pertaining to rural areas of Virginia. In addition, he pointed out that the first wind turbine foundation in federal waters has been erected off of Virginia Beach, describing that as another source of new jobs in the renewable energy sector. New extension for expiring licenses Although regional Virginia DMV offices have been gradually reopen by appointment for certain critical in-person services, the governor acknowledged that many people have had difficulties taking care of tasks with the DMV, including license and ID renewals. Because of that, Northam said the DMV is extending the deadline for license renewals. According to the DMV, all driver's licenses and identification cards expiring on or before July 31, 2020, are extended for 90 days, to August 31 at the latest. That means any customer whose credential expired between March 15 and May 31 gets 90 days from the expiration date to renew, and credentials expiring from June 1 to July 31 have until August 31 to get renewed. Vehicle registrations that expire in March, April, and May are also extended for 90 days. Those expiring in June are extended for 60 days and those expiring in July are extended for 30 days. National Guard funding Amid other announcements, Northam mentioned the federal government's approval of Virginia's request for an extension of Title 32 status for the Virginia National Guard, which will allow for the federal government to continue providing payment to help provide for National Guard troops assisting in Virginia's pandemic response, which the National Guard has been a critical part of, especially for community testing events. Graduations Gov. Northam addressed any high school and college seniors, saying they've worked for years and unfortunately won't get the in-person celebrations they expected but deserve to be honored for their hard work. He congratulated every graduate in Virginia and said he looks forward to them doing great things. On Friday evening at 5 p.m., he and his wife will be the hosts of ""Virginia Graduates Together,"" a live commencement ceremony for Virginia graduates airing on public television stations across the commonwealth, as well as on Facebook Live and YouTube. You can learn more about that event, which will feature a lot of celebrities from Virginia, here. Is a mask order health vs. wealth? Many questions posed by reporters on Thursday focused on how the new mask order will be enforced and its implications for business owners and employees across Virginia. Asked if he's forcing businesses to ""choose between health and wealth,"" Northam came back to a familiar statement he's made at many briefings, which is that Virginia is in the middle of both a health crisis and an economic crisis and will have to get through the health crisis first to get the economy recovering to the strong point it was at before the pandemic. The governor said his message to consumers and to businesses, as a business owner himself, is that the recovery is consumer-driven and that the focus should be on the health and safety of consumers, who may not feel comfortable going into businesses that they don't feel are working to protect their health. Northam said both health and wealth can be present at the same time as long as Virginians remember that ""we're all in this together"" and work for each other's safety. ""We are where we are today because of Virginians and I say thank you,"" Northam said, but continued that the only way to get through both the health and economic crises is to ""put the politics aside and be a part of the solution."" How Virginia will respond to any future spikes New modeling from the University of Virginia predicts large spikes of new cases in Virginia if the commonwealth continues on the 'Forward Virginia' plan for reopening. Gov. Northam said while he hasn't reviewed the newest UVA model yet, it's one his team reviews, but that modeling is only part of the picture. Ultimately, he said they're working with the data available on each day and taking steps for reopening on a day-by-day basis. If the data shows any new hot spots for the virus emerging this summer, with numbers not going in the right direction, Northam said adjustments will be made as needed. He pointed to the restrictions of Phase 1 and the delay for areas with worst data as a way they're working to prevent surges. What about the possibility of more cases in areas just now moving to Phase 1? The governor said the reason Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County will enter Phase 1 on Friday is because his team and their local goverments determined the data allows for it, based on a decrease of case activity in those areas, a decrease in hospital beds filled by COVID-19 patients, an increased ability to test and a lot more testing, and more PPE available. Northam thanked the leaders in each of the areas, but said, regardless, they will be monitoring the latest data each day to catch any potential spikes once the areas move to Phase 1. What about the timeline for those areas and Phase 2? When Phase 1 was announced for most of Virginia, Gov. Northam said it had a two-week minimum time period. However, with Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County starting Phase 1 on May 29 and the earliest start of Phase 2 on June 5, that only allows for one week. Asked if he would mandate those areas to spend two weeks in Phase 1 like the rest of Virginia, Northam said that discussion will be had with individual leaders for the areas, but if they're comfortable, he'd like to see all of Virginia move to Phase 2 at the same time. However, he said her remains open to discussions with any other areas that may not feel comfortable going forward into Phase 2. Will any move be made to stop evictions? With evictions able to continue now that Virginia's judicial emergency expired, Governor Northam said he still points anyone facing potential eviction to the resources his office has shared before and encourages landlords and tenants to work together to find ways to avoid evictions. He's not planning to take any specific action on the topic, but said he would look into if federal funds provided to local governments through the CARES Act can be used to help people catch up on rent. Why have deaths increased so much in Virginia over the past few days? The latest health department data reported this week has shown substantial increases in deaths reported due to COVID-19. But Dr. Forlano, the deputy health commissioner, said that's not necessarily tied to Phase 1 or to any one specific thing, because death data is a lagging indicator – meaning it's always at least several days behind. That's because the Virginia Department of Health has to wait for death certificates to validate any information about deaths connected to COVID-19. Why is the State of Emergency extended indefinitely? On Tuesday, the governor extended Virginia's state of emergency without an end date. He said that's because it allows Virginia to continue working with Medicaid to compensate telehealth and it allows continued use of the National Guard for assistance with testing, among other reasons. Announcements to come on Tuesday Governor Northam said he'll be addressing two questions he's heard a lot at his next briefing on Tuesday. The first is in regards to youth sports. He said he wants to encourage families and kids to be active this summer, but wants to make sure that's done safely, so on Tuesday, he'll be announcing new guidelines under which youth sports can be conducted. The second is about children returning to school. Northam said the Education Work Group has had a lot of great discussion on how children can return safely in the fall, and he'll have more announcements on that on Tuesday. For now, he said know that they're doing everything they can to make sure children can get back into classrooms safely. Closing notes from the governor Governor Northam encouraged Virginians to remember the more than 1,000 people around the commonwealth who have lost their lives due to COVID-19, as well as those who were killed in Virginia Beach a year ago. He also called for people to ""get the politics out of this"" and wear masks to protect each other so that Virginia can get the health crisis in the past and move on to getting the economic crisis taken care of too. The statewide situation in Virginia Most of Virginia officially entered Phase 1 of Gov. Northam's plan to gradually reopen the state on May 15 and all of Virginia will be in Phase 1 by May 29, but the commonwealth remains under a series of public health orders and executive orders designed to slow the spread of COVID-19. Executive Order 53, which closed many non-essential businesses across Virginia and established Virginia's 10-person gathering limit, no longer applies in its original form, with businesses steadily re-opening, but the 10-person gathering limit is still in place and still enforceable. Executive Order 55, the 'Stay at Home' order signed by Northam on March 30, is now a 'Safer at Home' order, instructing all Virginians to continue staying home as the safest way to prevent COVID-19's spread and specifically telling Virginians vulnerable to the virus to stay home except for essential needs. On Friday, May 29, Executive Order 63 goes into effect, making it mandatory for almost all Virginians to wear face coverings when entering businesses. You can learn how that will be enforced here. Virginia's state of emergency, which was set until June 10, was extended by Governor Northam on May 26 to run indefinitely. The Virginia Supreme Court's judicial emergency, which suspended all non-essential, non-emergency court hearings, expired on May 17 and court hearings across most of Virginia resumed on Monday, May 18. In light of that, with some eviction cases resuming, Gov. Northam's office released a list of resources to help people who may be facing eviction while still with income affected by COVID-19. DMV offices in Virginia began gradually reopening on Monday, May 18, andhave 14 customer service centers around the state are open by appointment only for specific reasons. During the closure, Virginia State Police have not been enforcing inspections and extensions have been granted to people with expiring credentials for themselves or their vehicles. Elective procedures and related offices, like dentists, were able to resume on May 1 after Gov. Northam lifted the public health order that initially closed them. Of the orders in place, Executive Order 53 is enforceable by law, so someone who hosts a gathering of more than 10 people can be charged with a Class 1 misdemeanor. You can learn more about what police enforcement of Northam's executive orders looks like here. Virginia's local elections in May and the primaries in June have each been postponed by two weeks. Virginia officials are encouraging all voters to request absentee ballots. Statewide case totals and testing numbers as of May 28 By May 28, the Virginia Department of Health had received reports of 39,393 confirmed and 2,008 probable cases of COVID-19 across the commonwealth. ""Probable"" cases are cases that were diagnosed by a doctor based on symptoms and exposure without a test – also known as clinical diagnoses. Those positive test results are out of 319,600 total tests administered in Virginia, which included 285,273 PCR tests and 34,327 antibody tests (The Dept. of Health announced last Thursday that they would start breaking testing data down by diagnostic and antibody tests, following criticism for initially reporting the two together.) Last week, there were 6,758 test results reported from Wednesday to Thursday and 7,983 new test results from Thursday to Friday. From Sunday to Monday, 17,246 new test results were reported – though, as noted near the top of this article, Monday's numbers included data from Sunday that was missed due to technical maintenance on the VDH system. From Monday to Tuesday, 8,366 new PCR tests were reported and 325 new antibody tests. From Tuesday to Wednesday, 9,795 new PCR tests and 88 new antibody tests were added to the state total. Now. from Wednesday to Thursday, 10,199 new PCR tests and 1,248 new antibody tests were added to the state total. As Virginia's community testing events offered by local health districts have increased, state health officials say the goal is to get tests to the areas in most need of them, with at-risk communities identified by the state health department (several of these events have been held in Harrisonburg and Rockingham County). Testing events sponsored by health districts are not turning anyone away. Overall, considering testing numbers and positive results, about 13% of Virginians who have been tested have received positive results. At the start of May, that percentage was standing steadily around 17%, but with increased testing, it's come down over time. However, some localities have much higher percentages, as outlined in our ""local cases"" section below. At this point, 4,442 Virginians have been hospitalized due to the disease caused by the virus, and at least 1,338 have died of causes related to the disease – a jump of 57 deaths reported to the health department in a day. The hospitalization and death numbers are totals confirmed by the Virginia Department of Health, which are always delayed by several days due to the logistics of medical facilities reporting information to local health districts, which then report it to the state health department. The hospitalization numbers are cumulative — they represent the total number of people hospitalized due to the disease throughout the pandemic and not the total number currently in the hospital. For current hospitalization stats, the VHHA offers more helpful data. The state website shows a lot of detail by locality, including hospitalizations and deaths for each city or county, and are broken down by zip code here, if you want to track cases on a neighborhood level. Where are our local cases? Overall, according to the Virginia Department of Health's May 28 breakdown, 319,600 tests have been run for the virus in Virginia, with 41,401 positive results. The department's breakdown and location map, available to the public here, shows the number of cases confirmed each day, number of people tested, total hospitalizations, total deaths, demographic breakdowns, and testing numbers, as well as breakdowns by health district. Here's a breakdown of cases for our region as of 9 a.m. on May 28. You can find the breakdown for the entire state in the chart at the bottom of this article. Numbers sometimes decrease day to day when the health department determines that a test initially reported in one locality was actually for a resident of another city, county, or state. Central Shenandoah • Augusta County - 105 • Buena Vista - 13 • Harrisonburg - 757 • Highland County - 3 • Lexington - 7 • Rockbridge County - 16 • Rockingham County - 490 • Staunton - 36 • Waynesboro - 41 Outbreaks: 15, with 6 in long-term care facilities, 1 in a healthcare setting, 6 in congregate settings, 1 in a correctional facility, and 1 in an educational setting Total tests: 7,217 Local percent positive: 20.3% Lord Fairfax • Clarke County - 24 • Frederick County - 319 • Page County - 213 • Shenandoah County - 414 • Warren County - 141 • Winchester - 168 Outbreaks: 16, with 7 in long-term care facilities, 3 in healthcare settings, 5 in congregate settings, and 1 in a correctional facility Total tests: 3,683 Local percent positive: 34.7% Thomas Jefferson • Albemarle County - 170 • Charlottesville - 102 • Fluvanna County - 88 • Greene County - 28 • Louisa County - 76 • Nelson County - 16 Outbreaks: 8, with 4 in long-term care facilities, 1 in a correctional facility, 2 in congregate settings, and 1 in an educational setting Total tests: 8,677 Local percent positive: 5.5% Rappahannock Rapidan • Culpeper County - 656 • Fauquier County - 303 • Madison County - 38 • Orange County - 92 • Rappahannock County - 13 Outbreaks: 6, with 1 in a long-term care facility, 1 in a healthcare setting, and 4 in congregate settings Total tests: 6,538 Local percent positive: 16.9% Local outbreaks As numbers have climbed in parts of the Shenandoah Valley, much of the increase has been attributable to outbreaks within particular facilities. By May 28, the Central Shenandoah Health District had identified 15 outbreaks and the Lord Fairfax Health District had 16. Health department officials have not specified the majority of the locations of our outbreaks, because the Virginia Department of Health has interpreted Virginia code as treating facilities the same as ""persons,"" meaning their anonymity has to be protected. So information about outbreaks is only released to the public if a facility grants permission for that to be released, and that has not been often. Of the outbreaks in our area, several have been confirmed at long-term care centers, including at Accordius Health Harrisonburg, where 22 patients died of COVID-19; here"" target=""_blank"">Skyview Springs, where there have been 16 confirmed deaths; Ritenour Rest Home in Staunton, where Augusta Health has confirmed a ""COVID situation"" but no exact numbers have been provided; and three outbreaks in Shenandoah County, including one at an unnamed nursing home and two at unnamed assisted living facilities. The largest of those outbreaks was the one at Accordius Health Harrisonburg, where 81 residents and 12 staff members tested positive for COVID-19 in April. By Tuesday, May 5, the facility confirmed 22 deaths due to coronavirus. By a little later in May, the large majority of patients had recovered from the virus. In Page County, the outbreak at Skyview Springs Rehab resulted in 59 residents and 23 staff members testing positive for the virus. By May 13, here"" target=""_blank"">16 people there had died of COVID-19-related causes. The facility has 115 residents total. Dr. Colin Greene, with the Lord Fairfax Health District, told WHSV earlier this month that the Skyview Springs outbreak was the only major outbreak in the Page County area. However, he said they were monitoring five active outbreaks in Shenandoah County. Due to Virginia code preventing the identification of facilities with outbreaks, he could not identify the exact locations, but said two were at businesses, two at assisted living facilities, and one at a nursing home. Outbreaks have also been confirmed at New Market Poultry, the Harrisonburg Men's Diversion Center, with at least 25 positive cases, and LSC Communications, which had at least six cases by the end of April but then stopped providing updates on their employee hotline so that media outlets would not have access to the information, which was not publicly provided. On May 26, RSW Regional Jail confirmed at least 15 people at the facility had tested positive for COVID-19, as the outbreak identified inside a correctional facility in the Lord Fairfax Health District. A day later, that number was up to 18 positive tests. Elsewhere, New Market Poultry Products, which has more than 100 employees working on a daily basis, confirmed near the end of April that they had multiple employees test positive – though an exact number was not provided and no update has come since then. None of the other Shenandoah Valley poultry plants have released any information about COVID-19 cases to the public, but 18 workers tested positive at the Pilgrim's Pride in Moorefield, W.Va. and Cargill in Dayton has confirmed the death of one employee due to COVID-19 – though never any information on the number of cases at the facility. Poultry plants and other meat processing facilities have been hotspots for the virus across the country and a focus of Gov. Northam's in Virginia. State health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver has also referenced the situation at poultry plants in Harrisonburg leading to a disproportionate number of cases among the Latino community in the Shenandoah Valley, though, again the facilities themselves have released no information publicly. The only exact number for poultry workers that has been provided is that as of May 20, at least 317 poultry plant workers living in the Central Shenandoah Health District had tested positive. Many of the local outbreaks that do not have confirmed locations have been identified in congregate settings, which could include workplaces, apartment complexes, churches, gyms, or any setting with a group of people in one place. While WHSV has received reports from viewers about specific stores, for instance, if the business does not provide consent for their information to be shared, the health department cannot confirm any information about cases there. Hospitalizations Of the state's 4,442 total hospitalizations, at least 118 have been in the Central Shenandoah Health District. Of those, 2 have been in Augusta County, 1 in Buena Vista, 56 in Harrisonburg, 52 in Rockingham County, 5 in Staunton, and 2 in Waynesboro. In the Lord Fairfax Health District, there have been at least 118 hospitalizations. Forty-four of those have been in Shenandoah County and 24 in Page County. Deaths As far as deaths, there have been 20 reported in Shenandoah County, 21 in Page County, one in Augusta County, 23 in Harrisonburg, and six in Rockingham County. Deaths, like all health department data, are reported by a person's listed residence. Dr. Norm Oliver, the state's health commissioner, has said that it often takes several days before local health districts are able to enter death information into the state database. Dr. Laura Kornegay, director of the Central Shenandoah Health District, told WHSV that deaths first have to be reported to them by medical facilities, which is a major cause for delays that have often been seen on the numbers reported for our area. Dr. Kornegay also explained that if someone has tested positive for COVID-19, that's what goes on their death certificate. Those death certificates have a space to list secondary causes of death, and that's where ongoing health issues like heart disease and cancer are listed. Some people have accused medical facilities of artificially inflating death tolls by doing that, but it's the same process by which flu deaths are reported every year. Recovery Wondering about the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19 in Virginia? Recovery information is not required to be sent to the Department of Health, so there is no accurate way to track that data for every single confirmed case. Individual health districts may track cases as ""active"" and ""non-active,"" but that data is not published anywhere in aggregate. But there is a way to track the number of patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 and have since been discharged – effectively tracking how many people have recovered from the most severe cases. The Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association updates their own dashboard of data each day on hospital-specific statistics, including bed availability, ventilator usage, and more. Their online dashboard indicates that, as of May 28, at least 5,472 COVID-19 patients have been discharged from the hospital. Unlike the VDH data that reports cumulative hospitalizations, their data on hospitalizations reflects people currently hospitalized for COVID-19 (whether with confirmed or pending cases), and that number is at 1,502. The data used by the VDH to report cumulative hospitalizations is based on information reported in hospital claims. On the other hand, the numbers reported by the Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association are based on a current census from hospitals, which provides a separate data set. Updates from Gov. Northam's May 26 briefing Addressing criticism for his mask-less Virginia Beach visit Governor Ralph Northam started Tuesday's briefing by directly addressing the criticism he received after photos showed him not wearing a mask during a visit to Virginia Beach over the weekend. Northam emphasized that Virginia Beach was only allowed to open after the city's reopening plan was approved by the state government to keep visitors as safe as possible amid the pandemic. He said he was at Virginia Beach to thank the mayor and city leaders for their work on that effort, thank first responders in the city, and thank ambasadors in the area, all while in open air along the beach with social distancing in each meeting. According to the governor, he was not planning to interact with members of the public while he was there. His account of the situation when pictures were taken is that he was headed down the Virginia Beach boardwalk to talk to members of the press when who he described as ""well-wishers"" approached him and wanted to take a photo. Northam claimed he was not prepared for that, and had left his mask in his car, but wanted to accommodate the people's request for a photo because he tries to not turn down to requests for photos. He thanked the people who he said held him accountable for his action of not wearing a mask and said he takes full full responsibility for not being prepared, and will work to be better prepared whenever he is out in the public again. Saying that he, like everyone, is forming new habits and routines to adjust to the new normal of COVID-19, he emphasized that it was his responsibility. Virginia Beach's reopening Following up his apology and explanation, the governor said Virginia Beach did well with reopening over the weekend, without large gatherings and with people social distancing and following the rules on the beach. Northam said he hopes Virginia Beach can be a model for other beaches across the country planning to reopen safely. Plans for other beaches Specifically, Northam said Virginia Beach's plan will be a benchmark for the state to consider proposed plans from Norfolk, Hampton, and other beaches along Virginia's coast that hope to open up this coming weekend. The governor said if their plans work like Virginia Beach's, those plans will be approved in the coming days. The latest data trends Gov. Northam very briefly recapped the latest case trends in Virginia, pointing to overall declines in percent positivity and hospitalizations across the commonwealth, alongside testing capacity trending upward and steady PPE supply numbers. He said that data supports assessments made by his state's team and by health district directors across Virginia, including in Northern Virginia. The future for areas still in Phase 0 Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County all remain in Phase 0 of Virginia's reopening plan, not yet in Phase 1, which the rest of Virginia entered on May 15. Local government leaders in Northern Virginia sent a formal letter to state health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver on Sunday, writing that the area has met most of the necessary data metrics to move into Phase 1, including two weeks of downward trends in cases. Accomack County leaders also indicated a readiness to move forward. In Richmond, Mayor Levar Stoney followed a different path, asking for the city to move into a modified Phase 1 that remains more restrictive. Northam said more information will be released by his office on Wednesday, while they remain in communication with Richmond's mayor, on guidelines for when each area will be able to move forward. However, he did confirm that the plan is for the areas to move into Phase 1 on Friday. For Richmond specifically, he said he received Mayor Stoney's letter Tuesday morning and is in discussion with the mayor and Richmond officials to figure out all the moving parts with their specific request. What about Phase 2 for the rest of Virginia? Gov. Northam, asked when he'll be able to say when most of Virginia can enter Phase 2, did not provide any specifics. He said the incubation period COVID-19 is around two weeks, which makes moving forward two weeks after the start of Phase 1 difficult, since the data won't be there yet for many cases contracted since Phase 1 began. Northam said his team will determine a data for Phase 2 as soon as they can, but Phase 1 will continue through at least this Friday. Essentially, he said the health department doesn't have the data yet to make a safe decision on Phase 2 timing, although the two-week minimum was a time period he initially announced. As Phase 1 continues, Northam reminded Virginians that it loosens restrictions but does not require business to reopen. Saying that ""just because you can open doesn't mean you have to open,"" he encouraged business owners to do what they feel is right for their workers and customers and encouraged local governments to communicate with business owners about the guidelines for safe operation. A mask order While Virginia remains in Phase 1, Gov. Northam said one major change will come this Friday. Effective Friday, May 29, Northam announced that people will need to wear face coverings inside public places of businesses. That order is taking effect through Executive Order 63. The new mask order applies to everyone 10 and over and requires wearing a face covering while "" entering, exiting, traveling through, and spending time in"" the following establishments: • All essential and non-essential brick and mortar retail establishments, including grocery stores and pharmacies • All personal care and grooming establishments • Inside food and beverage establishments (The text of the executive order specifies ""restaurants, dining establishments, food courts, breweries, microbreweries, distilleries, wineries, tasting rooms, and farmers markets, when permitted to reopen for indoor dining"") • On public transportation, including train stations, bus stations, and on intrastate public transportation, including in waiting or congregating areas • Entertainment or public amusement establishments when they're allowed to open in a later phase • State and local government buildings and areas where the public accesses government services • Inside any indoor space shared by groups of people who may congregate within six feet of one another or who are in close proximity to each other for more than ten minutes Exceptions are provided for the following situations: • Exercising • While eating or drinking • If you have trouble breathing or are unable to remove a mask without help • If health conditions prohibit wearing a face covering • Young children The governor strongly encouraged any child 3 years old and older wear a face covering if possible, but it's only required for children over the age of 10. Northam's office also issued a reminder that face coverings do not take the place of public health guidelines to maintain six feet of physical distancing, increase cleaning and sanitation, and wash hands regularly. Why? Gov. Northam said the reason for the face covering order is because protecting the people around us means face coverings. As research has continued into COVID-19, more and more health professionals have agreed that face coverings are critical to continuing daily operations around the country. ""I wear a mask to protect you, you wear a mask to protect me,"" said Dr. Norm Oliver, encapsulating the basic logic behind wearing face coverings, which help prevent droplets from yourself that could potentially infect others if you don't know you're symptomatic. What constitutes a face covering? Under Executive Order 63, a face covering includes anything that covers your nose and mouth, such as a mask, scarf, or bandana. Medical-grade masks and personal protective equipment should be reserved for health care professionals, Northam said. Getting a mask The governor said face coverings do not need to be medical grade and highly recommended many websites that have instructions on how to create your own face masks with materials at home, as well options like bandannas. He also encouraged any groups that can help provide face coverings to people who don't have them to please do that. How will the order be enforced? Governor Northam said the mask order is a ""matter of public health"" and not a criminal matter, so any enforcement of the new mask order will be done by health officials rather than law enforcement officials. The governor said his goal is to protect people's health and not to get people in trouble for not wearing masks, saying he's simply asking people to respect one another. However, pressed by reporters about how the order can be enforced, he said his office looked into the possibility of criminal enforcement and determined that violations could only be charged as a class 1 misdemeanor, which can come with large fines or even jail time, and he said that's not what he wanted. The governor's office is expecting the General Assembly to discuss the possibility of a civil fine for violations when they re-convene for a special session at some point in the next two months, but nothing is happening on that front at this point. So what does enforcement through the health department actually look like? The governor was very light on details when asked about that. Essentially, he said people would need to contact the Virginia Department of Health about any businesses that are not complying with the order. He said the legality of enforcement ""can get complicated in a hurry"" but simply said it will be enforced by the Virginia Department of Health. Clark Mercer, Northam's chief of staff, went into a little more detail, though. He said health officials would simply issue warnings to individuals not wearing masks, but their focus will be on businesses that are ""grossly negligent"" in enforcing the mask order. In the case of a business not following the mask order, the Virginia Department of Health and the Department of Labor and Industry can be contacted and can each take action against businesses, pulling the operating license of businesses that repeatedly refuse to comply with mask order. On Wednesday, WHSV reached out to the Virginia Department of Health, who issued this statement about how they can enforce the order: VDH has the power to enforce egregious patron/customer violations through a court order, which is punishable by a Class One misdemeanor. Many businesses also have face covering requirements for their employees as outlined in Phase One restrictions (restaurants, salons, etc.), which are enforced by the health department and the relevant regulatory agency. We are not looking to put anyone in jail—we are focused on education, and we hope and expect that Virginians will do the right thing. When can the mask order be lifted? Asked when the mask order will be able to be lifted, Northam said the problem with any timelines looking into the future is that COVID-19 is a novel virus, with more constantly being learned and the situation constantly developing. He said the order will be lifted as soon as it's safe to do so, but the focus is largely on protecting workers, and there is no exact timeline. Will face coverings be required in schools? Governor Northam has said repeatedly in briefings that he hopes to have schools reopen in the fall. Asked if the state may require face coverings for students when schools do reopen, the governor said his team is considering the possibility, but will have to see what the virus does in the coming months before fall comes. A decision will be made on potential face covering requirements by fall. Protecting workers Gov. Northam said the face covering order is especially designed to protect workers who are put in vulnerable populations by interacting with customers who come into businesses not wearing masks as more businesses reopen and more people venture out. Republican response House Republican Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, House Republican Caucus Chair Kathy Byron, R-Bedford, and House Republican Whip Jay Leftwich, R-Chesapeake issued the following statement in response to the governor's order: “We are deeply concerned about Governor Northam’s actions today. It is unconscionable to require businesses to enforce a government mandate under threat of sanction from government agencies. This puts yet another burden on businesses already reeling from months of being shut down or severely limited."" “Throughout this episode, the Governor has acted inconsistently. Through his own actions the Governor has squandered his capital as a physician whose advice people would be willing to follow. Virginians would be much more likely to follow the suggestions of a leader who instills confidence and leads with consistency.” New workplace regulations With worker safety in mind, Gov. Northam said Virginia's Department of Labor and Industry is working to draft new regulations on workplace safety standards amid the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring employers to have set guidelines for controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19 through specific measures for their workplace, including how to enforce social distancing and providing PPE for workers. These occupational safety standards will require the approval by vote of the Virginia Safety and Health Codes Board and must address personal protective equipment, sanitation, record-keeping of incidents, and hazard communication. Upon approval, the Department of Labor and Industry will be able to enforce the standards through civil penalties and business closures. Northam's optimism Governor Northam said he's optimistic for the future with the mask order in place, because he said he's seen Virginians doing the right things to control the virus' spread. But he asked Virginians to all remember the golden rule and keep looking out for each other. ""The future will not look like the past,"" he said, at least for a while, but he said Virginians have stepped up in the best ways. PPE and contact tracing Governor Northam said it's essential that all of Virginia has access to the necessary personal protective equipment and that the Virginia Department of Emergency Management has been working with agencies to provide all materials necessary to health care workers and first responders. He acknowledged that there's always more work to done, and also highlighted the continuing work of the Virginia Department of Health to hire 1,200 contact tracers, saying they may starting more if needed, but the process is moving forward. Monday's data surge Health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver was asked about the large number of cases and tests reported on Monday, which the health department announced later in the day was due to maintenance on their technical system that had prevented the release of most numbers on Sunday. Dr. Oliver told a reporter that he didn't see it as a discrepancy in the data, but just an update with two days worth of data. He said their servers were improved with new memory and storage, but while the servers were down for that upgrade, no new reports from local health districts could be processed into the dashboard. Is the governor getting tested? Gov. Northam said he has not been tested for COVID-19 yet in the pandemic, but that he looks forward to going to a community testing site in the near future to demonstrate how easy the test is and encourage more Virginians to get tested. Reporting recovery data? Asked once again about the possibility of reporting recovery information about Virginia's COVID-19 cases, health officials pointed Virginians to the VHHA website, which tracks the latest number of hospitalized patients who have since been discharged. A lack of demographic data A number of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Virginia still do not have demographic data available to the public. Health commissioner Dr. Oliver said that is tied to the clinician who places any particular COVID-19 test, because the health department gets their data from the labs. Dr. Oliver said they've worked to educate clinicians around Virginia on encouraging including race and ethnicity data when making lab orders for tests, and said they've seen great improvement, especially after the state was initially missing the data on more than half of cases early in Virginia's response. He also pointed to the Health Equity Work Group, which is looking at ways to look at the data and understand exactly how communities of color have been impacted. Protections for workers For employees who have returned to work or who are returning to work but don't feel comfortable in their workplace, Megan Healy, Gov. Ralph Northam’s chief workforce development adviser, said the current practice for Virginia is for the employee to try working directly with their employer to improve conditions. If that does not work, employees are encouraged to file a complaint with OSHA, which then passes the complaint on to Virginia DOLI. DOLI is also the department that Northam announced on Tuesday is implementing emergency temporary standards for all Virginia workplaces. However, Healy said those standards will have to be approved by health code boards, which she said should meet ""soon"" to consider codifying the new standards. Help for areas with higher death rates Dr. Laurie Forlano said Virginia's Health Equity Work Group is using software to track the communities at highest risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths based on the prevalence of chronic conditions, employment rates, poverty, and other factors, using that information to target prevention efforts at the communities in most need. She also said the data surveillance team for the state will look into the possibility of expanding data on deaths to indicate how many head underlying conditions. Moving forward Governor Northam said his focus is on the health and well-being of Virginians, especially the health and well-being of workers. With the mask order going into effect Friday, he encouraged Virginians to use the next few days to get ready. He also emphasized in his closing remarks that the move is not to punish people but to promote safety because ""we're all in this together."" The governor encouraged everyone to cooperate and ""be a part of the solution"" so that Virginia can get the health crisis in the rearview mirror and begin returning to normal. Previous updates from Gov. Northam's May 22 briefing The latest Virginia data and prevention As has been the norm for Governor Northam's COVID-19 briefings, he began Friday's by reviewing the latest data on Virginia's cases and testing, which has shown the number of tests trending upward the percent of positive tests trending downward. However, as positive test percentages continue to trend down, the governor says it's just as important, if not more important, to continue following the basic guidelines on how to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including social distancing of at least 6 feet, hand-washing, and wearing a face covering in public. A mandatory face mask order? Gov. Northam emphasized that wearing a face covering could potentially save someone else's life, since they are worn to protect others from yourself, with many people carrying the virus without symptoms. The governor said face coverings are an important part of Virginia's next steps and that he'll have more to say on that next week, when the next state briefing happens on Tuesday. While not outright saying that he'll be issuing a mask order, he very strongly suggested it. Later in the briefing, the governor was asked about Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney's request for a mask order for the capital city. Northam said he has been in communication with Richmond officials about it, but has also been discussing plans for a policy with his COVID-19 task force and working through the details. He said one of their focuses is on equity: being able to make sure everyone has access to a mask, and pointed to many ways people can wear face coverings without purchasing a specific surgical mask, like using bandannas, or following online instructions for DIY masks without needing to sew. Another focus, he said, has been how his administration could enforce such an order. Masks are intended to protect other people, Northam reminded Virginians, and said that's the main goal for COVID-19 response. He clarified that his announcement on Tuesday will be for all of Virginia and will especially apply to places of business. What about Phase 2 and the plan for areas still in Phase 0? The governor said he knows everyone is wondering when Virginia will enter Phase 2 and when northern Virginia, Accomack County, and Richmond will be able to enter Phase 1 with the rest of the state. He said his team is in constant communication with the localities that are still in Phase 0 at their requests, and he'll have more on the timeline for the next phase for those areas and the rest of the state next week as well. A new assessment tool Governor Northam announced that the Virginia Department of Health is launching a new tool to let people check their symptoms and find the closest testing site to their location. It's called ""COVID Check,"" a telehealth and online risk assessment tool that you can find: HERE. Northam said it will ask you for your symptoms, and, based on your responses, give recommendations on what you should do next, including options on where you can go to get testing. A statewide testing effort Northam highlighted the Virginia Department of Health's community testing events across the commonwealth, which included more than 4,300 tests given this week. He thanked the Virginia National Guard, which has conducted over 10,000 tests so far, and showed a slide featuring multiple community testing events organized by the health department for the coming week, including one in Rockingham County. After thanking the National Guard for their testing assistance, Northam also thanked them for their work rescuing people from severe flooding in southwest Virginia over the past few days. The pilot program for online SNAP ordering The governor also announced the pilot project approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week to allow Virginia families who receive SNAP benefits to order groceries online through select retailers and have them delivered. Right now, the plan includes Walmart and Amazon, but more retailers are expected to be added in the coming weeks. It will launch on May 29, Northam said, and will allow families with low incomes to get access to nutritious food without having to leave their homes and will help keep people with underlying conditions from having to go out. He thanked Virginia's senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, for pushing to make the pilot program possible. Unemployment in Virginia Virginia had 44,000 new claims for unemployment insurance over the past week, bringing the state's current unemployment rate up to 10.6%. Gov. Northam pointed to the state's 2.8% rate before the pandemic as a sign of how strong Virginia was doing on the business front before COVID-19, but said his administration is working to help those left unemployed as much as possible. Thousands of Virginians have reported problems with the Virginia Employment Commission system, left unable to access a real person for help with questions and left without receiving benefits, though. To help respond to that, Northam said on Friday that he knows many people have had difficulties, and the Virginia Employment Commission (VEC) is opening up a new call center with 315 additional employees to help handle the influx of calls. A plan for graduates With high schoolers and college students across Virginia not able to have their traditional graduation ceremonies this year, Gov. Northam announced that Virginia Public Media will be airing a celebration of all Virginia graduates called ""Virginia Graduates Together"" next Friday, May 29, at 5 p.m. Across the state, all public TV channels will air the ceremony, which will feature special guests to honor 2020 graduates. He encouraged graduating seniors to submit photos, videos, and special messages for the ceremony to Virginia Public Media at vpm.org/grad. Eid This weekend marks Eid al-Fitr, holy days for Muslims, and Gov. Northam wished all Muslims in Virginia a blessed and joyous celebration, but encouraged safe celebrations amid the pandemic. Memorial Day With this coming Monday marking Memorial Day, Gov. Northam said he's asking all Virginians to remember this weekend what the day is for and to recognize all members of the U.S. military who have given it all and made the ultimate sacrifice. He encouraged reflections on their sacrifices and said the Virginia War Memorial's annual event will be a virtual one this Monday. Virginia state flags will be flying at half-staff to honor all the sacrifices of the military on Monday, and at half-staff to honor COVID-19 victims over the weekend, just like President Trump's order for U.S. flags on federal buildings. While people mark the holiday weekend, Northam encouraged all Virginians to maintain social distancing, avoid large gatherings, and wear face coverings. The unemployment work search requirement Throughout this pandemic, the Virginia Employment Commission has not been enforcing their normal work search requirement for people to receive unemployment insurance. Megan Healy, Gov. Ralph Northam’s chief workforce development adviser, explained that that requirement will not be re-instituted until the Virginia Employment Commission's 61 work search centers are reopen. At this point, they all remain closed and employees are working remotely. Unemployment trust fund running empty Healy said reports that Virginia's trust fund for unemployment insurance is running out of money are correct. While the additional $600 a week for unemployment and the PUA program are paid for directly by the federal government, she said the large influx of unemployment claims across Virginia, like around the nation, have drained the state's unemployment insurance fund, which is normally paid for through state taxes. The state is asking the federal government for assistance. President Trump's order for places of worship Minutes before Gov. Northam took the podium for his briefing, President Donald Trump announced that he was deeming houses of worship essential services and called on governors to allow them to reopen this weekend. Asked for his response, Governor Northam said he wants to be sure people can practice their faith safely, and that's why his administration moved houses of worship to the same guidelines as retail in Phase 1 of the 'Forward Virginia' plan. Both places of worship and retail stores are allowed to operate at 50% capacity with social distancing measures and increased sanitation in place. However, he said he's not requiring houses of worship to open up to in-person services and knows many have chosen to continue drive-in or live-streamed services. It's up to the individual church, mosque, temple, or other house of worship. A recent spike in deaths in the state numbers Asked about one day this week in which the Virginia Department of Health statistics indicated a rise of dozens of deaths in a day, the governor reiterated a point state health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver has made before, which is that the deaths added to the state database in a given day don't necessarily line up with when the deaths occurred. That's due to delays between death certificates being filed, the healthcare agency reporting that death to their local health district, and the health district then reporting the death to the health department. So on the state level, they are focusing directly on the death certificates and their issued dates to analyze any potential spikes, following every death, because he said every death is important. Releasing data from point prevalence testing at long-term care facilities Dr. Forlano, who has been heading up Virginia's task force focused on responding to COVID-19 at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in Virginia, said there are 43 facilities statewide in the process of testing everyone for COVID-19 at this moment. That's in addition to point prevalence testing conducted at other facilities in recent weeks. While they'll be releasing aggregate data from that testing on the overall situation at Virginia long-term care facilities, they are not planning to provide specifics about the number of cases at any given facility, in line with previous health department guidance treating facilities as ""persons."" Memorial Day travel from areas in Phase 0 The governor issued a reminder that all Virginians in areas that are still under Phase 0 – Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County – are still under the 'Stay at Home' order and should only leave home for essential reasons. He urged them not to travel over Memorial Day weekend to other parts of Virginia that may be further along the reopening process. Regional reopening plans Asked about how those ares being behind the guidelines for the rest of the state will affect the overall reopening timeline, Gov. Northam once again went back to his description of the state guidelines as ""a floor,"" with regions able to have more restrictions, but not less. That plan is not changing, the governor said, but the rest of Virginia will not have to wait on Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County either. He said each of those areas will stay on their own timelines and is expected to move into Phase 1, 2, and 3 at different times than the rest of the commonwealth. What about reporting recovery numbers? Asked about why Virginia does not report the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver explained that the VDH system is set up to identify cases as they're reported and then trace any people potentially exposed to the Virginians with confirmed cases. The department does not provide care to the patients, so he said they don't necessarily know any information about the recovery of each person with a case. Instead, the health department's limit is reporting the cases as they get them, providing the information on those cases – including on local levels down to the ZIP code – and that's about it, because they don't have continuing data on each case. However, state officials do point people to the VHHA data reported each day, which tracks the number of active hospitalizations for COVID-19 and the number of previously hospitalized patients who have been discharged. There's a lot of information on patients who have recovered, officials said, especially since that encompasses at least 95% of people who contract the virus. And we should celebrate those who survive and recover, they said. The role of antibody tests Dr. Laurie Forlano said the VDH website has guidelines on when providers should use different kind of testing, like antibody tests, but said everyone is still learning about the best role of antibody testing in the process. She encouraged people to talk to their healthcare providers directly about potential antibody tests. In addition, health commissioner Dr. Oliver encouraged any Virginians who have gotten antibody tests and tested positive for the COVID-19 antibody to still take all necessary precautions to prevent getting the virus, because it's not clear yet whether testing positive for the antibody actually prevents someone from being infected. Stay safe on the roads if traveling Public health secretary Brian Moran said traffic on Virginia's roads has been significantly reduced throughout the pandemic as people stay at home, and they expect low numbers this Memorial Day weekend, but they have seen some ridiculous three-digit speeding tickets of drivers taking advantage of the empty roads. He encouraged anyone traveling this weekend to observe the speed limit, stay safe, and arrive safely. Memorial Day weekend and mask preparations Governor Northam closed out Friday's briefing by asking Virginians to mark Memorial Day with respect and remembrance for the many men and women who have paid the ultimate price in service of their country. He said to thank any active duty military members and veterans if you see them this weekend as well. He also said that he likes to give homework over the weekends, as he has mentioned at past briefings, and this weekend's has to do with masks. Even more strongly suggesting a pending mask order than earlier in the briefing, he said all Virginians should make plans this weekend for you and your family to have face coverings. All children 3 and up are encouraged to wear face masks in most guidance so far, and Northam said that's because children are likely to carry the virus without showing symptoms and potentially spread it to others. He encouraged Virginians to find any way to get face coverings that is available to them – whether that's by buying them at local stores, making them with online instructions, or using bandannas or other materials you already have. And be ready on Tuesday to go out with those face coverings when conducting any public business, if you're not already, he said. Meanwhile, his administration will be doing their work by finalizing the details of the new policy they expect to announce on Tuesday. Previous updates from Gov. Northam's May 20 briefing Spanish translation Governor Ralph Northam began Wednesday's briefing by noting that the Virginia Department of Emergency Management started offering a version of his briefings on Monday with live Spanish language interpretation on the VDEM Facebook page. That will continue for the foreseeable future. Virginia's data metrics and testing As is the norm for the governor, who has been noted throughout the pandemic as the nation's only medical doctor serving as a governor, he reviewed the most recent data on Virginia's COVID-19 case trends. Northam pointed to the state's percent positivity, which has been steadily decreasing over the past week with more testing. He reminded Virginians that there are multiple ways to get tested for COVID-19 amid the pandemic, including the most common avenues through healthcare providers, hospitals, and clinics, as well as through community testing events sponsored by local health districts. A key part of the testing process comes after a test returns with a positive result, and that's contact tracing – through which health department officials determine anyone who was in close contact with an infected person and instruct those people to self-quarantine. The governor touched back on a topic that state health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver has been addressing for a few weeks, which is that the Virginia Department of Health is working to hire 1,000 contact tracers and 200 supervisors for contact tracing efforts in the state. Access to PPE in Virginia After questions were raised in recent days regarding the supply of personal protective equipment in Virginia, Gov. Northam said that PPE is at a place where hospitals have an adequate supply. No hospitals have reported problems obtaining PPE for a few weeks now, but this week, the VHHA started publicly reporting the number of licensed nursing facilities that have indicated PPE shortages, and there are at least 10 without enough N95 masks and 21 without enough isolation gowns. The governor said the Virginia Department of Emergency Management has a stockpile available for any facility in need, but that healthcare providers need to let the department know, so that resources can be provided. According to Northam, VDEM, so far in the pandemic, has distributed more than 795,000 N95 masks, 1.3 million surgical masks, 3 million gloves, 285,331 isolation gowns, 427,000 face shields, and 24,359 containers of hand sanitizer to facilities around the state. He said the department's priority is to support response at facilities deemed high risk and to support those reporting need. But, Northam said, the directive has been that healthcare providers should exhaust supplies of PPE obtained from private supply chains before asking for public supplies. He said the Department of General Services established a rapid review process for vendors that can supply PPE to healthcare providers and has a list of suppliers online at dgs.virginia.gov. Northam also described a Virginia partnership with Amazon to support PPE orders directly and an effort by FEMA to ship PPE directly to Virginia nursing homes, with two shipments so far, each with at least a week's worth of equipment. If a facility has run out of PPE obtained through private supply chains, he said the facility needs to contact the Virginia Department of Emergency Management so that state officials can get them more. Access to healthcare Governor Northam took part of Wednesday's briefing to discuss access to health care in Virginia, which he said he believes is a right. The governor said the state's expansion of Medicaid in 2018 has allowed more than 421,000 Virginians to enroll in Medicaid coverage, offering health care to people who did not have access before. Praising the Medicaid expansion, Northam said families have been able to get treatment for underlying conditions that can make people more vulnerable to COVID-19 complications, and said everyone ""should be grateful"" for the expanded coverage during this pandemic. However, he said there's more work to do for all Virginians to have access to health care, so to help with that, he announced that he's convening a new work group that will focus on identifying ways to reduce costs and increase access to healthcare for all Virginians. Also, in light of his efforts to expand access, Northam commended the General Assembly for banning ""balanced billing"" in the most recent legislative session, but declared that he's vetoing three bills: Senate Bill 861, Senate Bill 235, and House Bill 795. The governor said each of those bills passed by lawmakers would address health care costs for targeted groups of Virginians but that he felt it best to veto them to focus on ""more broad-based health care solutions for all Virginians."" He encouraged the bills' sponsors to work with the new work group to find solutions for a broader group. AARP Virginia swiftly issued a response applauding the governor's vetoes, saying he ""used his veto power today to stop three health care measures that would have had a calamitous impact on older and sicker Virginians."" Substance abuse and recovery amid COVID-19 Gov. Northam said he's well aware that people in recovery from substance abuse disorders are facing increased challenges during the pandemic, describing increases in overdoses in Roanoke County and spikes of overdoses in the northern Shenandoah Valley specifically. He said his administration is working to respond to that situation by encouraging telehealth and loosening restrictions to allow more telehealth options for substance abuse treatment, promoting video meetings for recovery groups, and pushing other similar options. The governor said the Department of Behavioral Health has a list of ongoing virtual recovery groups on their website. Local and primary elections After Virginia's local elections on Tuesday, Gov. Northam said the day went smoothly, thanking Virginia's Board of Elections and the thousands of volunteers around the state who helped maintain safe polling places for in-person voting. Northam also thanked Virginians for following the state's recommendation to vote absentee by mail. He said more than 55,000 absentee ballots were cast for Tuesday, compared to around 1,700 in the comparable May local election in 2016. Looking ahead to the next election, Virginia's June primaries, he said the state is again is strongly encouraging people to vote absentee by mail. The deadline to request an absentee ballot, which can be done online or through your local registrar's office, is 5 p.m. on June 16, a week ahead of the election day itself o June 23. Live Health Equity Work Group meeting At 7 p.m. on Thursday, May 21, Virginia's Health Equity Work Group, which Gov. Northam has frequently discussed at his briefings, will be holding a live meeting that Virginians can view on WRIC, the ABC affiliate in Richmond. The Virginia National Guard's response As the Virginia National Guard has worked around the commonwealth to provide testing through local health district community testing events and coordinated nursing home testing, four Guard members have tested positive for COVID-19. The head of Virginia's National Guard said those four members were out of over 120 helping provide testing statewide and that none of the National Guard members working in the field are carrying the virus. He said they are rigorously screened ahead of each testing event. The Guard is focusing on testing as many long-term care centers as possible, with health department coordination, but that's just one component of their overall testing effort, according to Command Sergeant Major Ronald L. Smith Jr.. They've also requested funding from the federal government for the Guard to offer more resources at local testing events. How Virginia is helping in low-income communities Asked how Virginia is responding to the need for tests in low-income and minority communities around Virginia, Gov. Northam said he'll bring a list on Friday to highlight the lower socio-economic communities around the state with planned health district testing events. Northam said it's key to be able to enter Phases 2 and 3 that adequate testing is available to everyone around the commonwealth, and said Dr. Karen Remley's testing work group is working hand-in-hand with the health department to make that possible. He also thanked the work of free health clinics across Virginia, which have seen large increases in patients during the pandemic, even with dropping donations as they work to expand access to health care. Calling healthcare a right, the governor said he wants ""all Virginians to have access to quality and affordable care."" What data metrics are guiding future plans? Asked what data metrics he and his cabinet are using to determine when Virginia can begin Phase 2 or determine if any localities need to go back to increased restrictions, the governor said they're using the same metrics that were used to enter Phase 1. In particular, those focus on the number of new cases, percent positivity, the amount of PPE available, testing capability, hospital capacity and equipment available at hospitals, as well as staffing available at healthcare centers. Northam said each of those is based on guidance from the CDC and the White House, and their focus is on trends in the data over week and two-week spans: not particularly paying attention to day by day numbers, which vary. He said they currently do not have any specific thresholds, like a specific percent positivity increase, that would result in increased restrictions for a locality. However, the governor said his team meets every day to review the latest data to catch any potential dangerous increase in cases at a locality's level, since the best way to prevent escalations is to catch them at the start. He said if trends rise in a specific locality or zip code, action will be taken as needed, whether that be offering more testing or reversing Phase 1 guidelines, but said that hasn't had to be done yet. If any localities choose to ignore the state guidelines, regardless of data, Northam said he'll direct concerns about that to the locality. The future for Northern Virginia Governor Northam said his staff is in daily communication with leaders throughout Northern Virginia to determine how that region, which remains in Phase 0 at local leaders' request, will move forward. Asked about his response to specific localities, including parts of counties and cities in the area, requesting to enter parts of Phase 1 guidance, he said the policy is for the guidelines in place to be ""the floor"" and that localities within the area can go farther with restrictions but not loosen them to keep consistency for the region, which has also been coordinating with Maryland and Washington, D.C. While his team is following the latest data trends, Northam said he does not have a specific date set yet for the start of Phase 2, which would come, at the earliest, on May 29. Northam said it will happen when the data supports it and when local leaders are comfortable with it. Funding from the feds Asked about funding being provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Gov. Northam said a significant amount will be directed toward testing supplies and staff to administer tests at long-term care facilities, as well as boosting Virginia's contact tracing capability. Details of contact tracing On the note of contact tracing, health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver was asked about the process and how information on people is shared. Dr. Oliver explained that contact tracers working with local health districts speak someone who has just received a positive test for COVID-19, have them isolate themselves, determine who the person has been in close contact with, and reach out to each of those people to instruct them to self-quarantine. Throughout the time that someone is self-quarantined, contact tracers stay in communication with them to help them manage the process and check in on how they're doing and progressing. If their condition changes, they're urged to seek treatment and testing. While people are under observation in self-quarantine, Dr. Oliver said their names are not released to the public, but that they do encourage people to release their names to healthcare providers for help with monitoring conditions, and assistance with getting food, medicine, and other services. How is information on community testing events being shared? Anytime a community testing event has been scheduled, the governor said health districts are reaching out to legislators and local officials for their help spreading the word, as well as looking to local media to share the information on when and where the events are happening. When testing is available in a particular neighborhood, Gov. Northam said they encouraged not only people with symptoms to get tested, but anyone who may be concerned they were exposed or worried because they live with a vulnerable person and want to be sure they won't spread the virus. Those providing the testing will not turn anyone way. How can a locality get testing? Northam said if any specific locality wants health district testing, they can notify their local health district and the Virginia Department of Health, which will then work with them to get their area testing. If they let VDEM know the situation, more PPE can be provided as well. In a better place than before Asked to reflect on Virginia's progress in the pandemic, Northam said that it was a rough start, like most of the country, but pointed to better supplies, better testing capacity, and better healthcare preparedness now, thanking Virginians for working through a difficult time for everyone and for following the state's guidelines. He compared the novel virus to a novel, saying that every day brings a new chapter or two to the situation, and that while he wishes he knew how the last chapter will read, no one does yet, and everyone is in it together to get there as safely as possible. With businesses opening, what about yard sales and flea markets? Virginia's deputy secretary of commerce and trade came to the podium to address a reporter's question about guidance for businesses that may not fit the traditional definitions for which most guidance has been offered. She said the department has a comprehensive suite of guidelines for businesses that can open with restrictions in Phase 1, but any events and/or businesses, like flea markets and yard sales, that aren't brick-and-mortar retail establishments just need to meet the general guidelines for Phase 1, including face coverings for workers who interact with people, sanitation of high-touch surfaces, protections for workers, and all basic guidelines that apply to businesses in general. When is Phase 2 coming? Governor Northam said there is no specific date for Phase 2 at this point. His team will keep watching the data in the coming days, with the earliest possible date being May 29, but as of now, no date is set and no date is set for him to announce a decision, since it's based on data changing day by day. Childcare and unemployment The Virginia Employment Commission, which manages the unemployment insurance program in the commonwealth, is overseen by the federal government and has to follow federal guidelines. Because of that, while schools have been closed, their closure has provided a legally acceptable reason for unemployment, summer coming means that is about to change, and they'll be federally mandated to stop unemployment benefits when that's the provided reason. So the VEC says they are working to figure out options related to childcare in the summer months. Northam's closing notes Governor Northam said he wants to let everyone know he understands everyone has been through a very difficult time over these months, as a lot of people have made sacrifices, many have lost their jobs, access to healthcare and PPE has been a challenge, and addition has become its own crisis. However, he said he wants people to remember that everyone is on edge right now. He mentioned the ice cream shop in Michigan that had to close back down due to customers being extremely rude on their first day back open, and said people need to understand that everyone has been under stress. We can agree to disagree on specific things, the governor said, but ""at the end of the day, we all have to work together."" He said his message to Virginians, who live in the best state in the country, is to ""be kind,"" because that's how everyone can get through the pandemic together and get the health crisis and then the economic crisis behind us. Previous updates from Gov. Northam's May 18 briefing Reminding Virginians to keep following safety guidelines Governor Ralph Northam began Monday's briefing with a reminder for all Virginians to keep following all CDC and VDH guidelines for their safety throughout Phase 1. It's a gradual process of lifting restrictions and does not mean that the pandemic is over, he reminded everyone, and, if anything, said it's more important than ever as more places open up to keep following all recommendations. Speaking about masks and face coverings, Northam said some people may find it inconvenient, but urged everyone to remember that it can save other people's lives. He said from what he's seen, most people have been following the guidelines, and he appreciates that. The latest data Gov. Northam quickly highlighted the latest data on COVID-19 testing in Virginia, showing graphs and charts that have become a mainstay of his thrice-weekly briefings. The latest numbers continue trends of increased testing in Virginia, along with decreased percent positivity – the amount of Virginians who got tests who test positive over a 7-day span. He said his team's focus has been to ramp up testing specifically in areas with at-risk populations, using a map from the Virginia Department of Health showing all the current health department-sponsored testing sites in at-risk areas, with many in northern Virginia, which has seen, by far, the highest proportion of cases in the commonwealth. Northam also pointed to the work of Virginia's Health Equity Group, which is distributing masks and hand sanitizer, along with educational flyers, in high-risk areas identified by health officials. The next plan for that distribution is in Petersburg, alongside testing, on May 23. The group previously rolled out a similar initiative in Harrisonburg and will carry out another one in Richmond. Reopening Virginia Beach Governor Northam announced in Monday's COVID-19 briefing that Virginia Beach will be opening up to the public for recreational activity as of Friday, May 22, kicking off Memorial Day weekend. The governor said Virginia Beach specifically had been working on a comprehensive plan to reopen their beach safely, with social distancing measures in place, for weeks, and that he had asked Virginia's director of natural resources to help them toughen up their plan. With a new plan in place that the governor says will allow safer use of the beach, he approved Virginia Beach's request to reopen on May 22 for activities including swimming, surfing, fishing, and other recreational activities. Not allowed will be group activities, including group sports like volleyball, speakers playing music to large groups, alcohol, tents and groups of umbrellas, and other group-related activities. The city's parking garages and parking lots for the beach will be limited to 50 percent capacity as a way to reduce group sizes. However, Gov. Northam said if people swarm the beach and ignore restrictions, he ""will not hesitate"" to put restrictions back into place and go as far as closing the beach if necessary. Northam said his message to any beach-goers is simple: ""You must be responsible."" The governor invited the Virginia Beach mayor to the podium, and the mayor said he believes opening up beaches is healthy for people physically, mentally, and emotionally. However, he said he and the governor share a primary concern, which is making sure that people who go to the beach to receive those health benefits do it safely. The mayor said the city's plan is meant to protect visitors, residents, and the thousands of frontline staff who keep businesses along the beach running. To do that, the city has hired hundreds of people to serve as ""beach ambassadors,"" who will help coordinated efforts to clean high-touch surfaces and will enforce the beach's regulations. They'll also have teams dedicated to educating visitors about the new rules. Acknowledging that beaches around the country have faced compliance problems, he said he wants people to know that they are welcome to Virginia Beach and are safe, but that the city is asking them to comply with the rules. Those rules, the mayor said, will benefit everyone as friends and neighbors. Governor Northam emphasized that the opening applies only to Virginia Beach and First Landing State Park – not to any other beaches in the state. But he encouraged other beaches to look to Virginia Beach's plan as a model for any reopening plans for the future. The Virginia Republican Party's response on Monday was mixed. ""We're finally seeing movement in the right direction, but there is still a disappointing lack of trust in people and local governments to be able to use what we know about this virus to be able to open as safely as possible,"" said House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert. ""We can’t stay shuttered forever. The Governor’s energy should be focused on providing specific guidance to people and businesses on how to interact safely rather than telling them what they can’t do."" The plan for schools moving forward In late March, Gov. Northam became the first state governor to order schools closed for the remainder of the academic year, followed in the coming weeks and months by similar decisions in other states. Northam said on Monday that his administration's decision on school closings proved to be the right choice. But, moving into the summer, he said he knows that school staff and administrators, along with families, are looking at what will come next in the fall. In regards to that, Gov. Northam announced a new team of education leaders that will meet with Virginia's public health team in the coming weeks to develop specific ""next steps"" for public and private K-12 schools, as well as for colleges and universities. The team is made up of local school superintendents, public and private college and university presidents, school officials, the Virginia Department of Education, and student representatives. It's called the Virginia COVID-19 Education Work Group, and representatives of the group say they're focusing their guidance on making sure Virginia schools have consistent guidelines on continuity of learning. Responding to a question about how important is is to him to get students back into schools by the fall, Northam said it was an easy question because ""it's very important."" He commended educators for the work they've done throughout the pandemic to move into new forms of virtual educations and other ways to keep students learning, but said it's not a perfect solution. His view, he said, is that children will be better off back in classrooms because, as he described it, it's an equity issue. He pointed to the 550,000 families across Virginia who don't have access to broadband and don't have ways to access virtual education. ""I am hopeful that our students will be back in the classroom this fall,"" Northam said. The newly appointed team will find ways to make that safely happen. Courts and evictions Most courts across Virginia officially reopened on Monday after the end of a judicial emergency order from the Supreme Court of Virginia. Unfortunately, Northam said, that means some eviction cases that been put on hold will be moving forward. While the governor is not specifically deferring eviction cases or taking any similar action, he highlighted a number of actions his administration has taken and resources available. The governor said his cabinet is working with Virginia Housing, the state housing agency, which has committed $12 million to support nonprofit housing support services for anyone who may have lost housing. He also said legislation was amended earlier in the pandemic to allow tenants a 60-day deferral on eviction if they can prove COVID-19-related economic hardships. Northam said his team is pushing the federal government to include money for rent assistance in any future federal stimulus package. In addition, the governor said stayhomevirginia.com has resources for landlords, tenants, and the homeless, as well as a summary of resources for people in need of housing assistance. Asked if he'll be taking any further measures, like have been taken in some states to defer the need for people to go to court to submit financial documents to prove financial hardship, the governor reiterated the moves he had already described. VDEM staffing change Gov. Northam announced that Dr. Jeff Stern, the coordinator of emergency management for Virginia, is moving on to work with FEMA, where he will train emergency managers around the country. Local elections Local elections in many areas around the state are happening on Tuesday, and Gov. Northam said he hopes most Virginians already voted absentee by mail, but said crews will be hard at work cleaning and putting social distancing measures in place at polling locations so everyone can be safe as possible when voting. The Virginia Medical Reserve Corps will be helping to staff polling places to reduce risk to many normal volunteers who may be in vulnerable populations. What about candidates filing for November? Some candidates for local elections in November have a deadline to file a petition with enough signatures to get their names on the November ballot by June 9. State officials said that neither Virginia's department of elections, nor the governor, can change that deadline under their statutory authority. However, Northam encouraged all candidates to find ways to be creative going forward to try and get those petitions completed, and said, if unable, they can petition the courts for relief. Face mask requirement discrepancies Gov. Northam was asked why facial coverings are mandatory for some sectors of retail in Phase 1 while not for others. He said a lot of what went into that decision boiled down to focusing on those who serve others, like restaurant and grocery store employees, which led to a priority for facial coverings. Concerned employees Coming back to a point made in past briefings, Northam said it's very important to his administration that Virginians can make it known if they don't feel comfortable in their workplace. While Virginia has to work within federal guidelines on unemployment insurance and other standards, the governor again issued a reminder that any employee can file a complaint through the Department of Labor and Industry if their workplace is unsafe or can contact OSHA. He said he's tried to be as open as possible about that and encouraged Virginians to use the options available to them. Virginia's remdesivir distribution process Remdesivir is the only drug to receive some level of FDA approval as a potential COVID-19 treatment. It has showed effectiveness in shortening symptoms for some of the most severe cases of the viruses and in reducing mortality. But there is a very limited supply nationwide. According to state health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver, Gilead Sciences, the developer of the drug, donated about a million and a half doses to the federal government, which then sent out initial shipments to hospitals with high numbers of cases, including in northern Virginia. After that, any new distributions have been sent directly to the Virginia Department of Health, where a medical advisory committee of healthcare providers has developed an allocation process to randomly select hospitals in Virginia for remdesivir distribution. Dr. Oliver said the process is set up so that every individual patient hospitalized with COVID-19 in Virginia has an equally random chance at receiving the medication. For instance, Virginia recently got 10 cases of the drug, which were distributed through that process, and has 96 cases, containing enough medication for about 400 patients, coming in now. Dr. Oliver said the process will be used for that shipment as well to give everyone an equal chance of receiving it. The goal for percent positivity As testing has increased in Virginia, percent positivity has been slowly declining. Dr. Forlano said the goal for Virginia is to get down to a 10% rate or lower. The trends are moving in that direction, but it will take some time. Response to the Legislative Black Caucus Last week, the Legislative Black Caucus issued a statement against Phase 1 starting on May 15, saying that black people would be ""used as guinea pigs"" in the reopening plan. Gov. Northam was asked again on Monday about how he's addressed their concerns, and he pointed back to his answer on Friday, which primarily related to the work of Virginia's Health Equity Group, which has focused on getting tests, PPE, and support into minority communities at high risk of the virus.

1619682834,2020-05-29 01:12:19,Police across US speak out against Minneapolis custody death,https://www.wsls.com/news/politics/2020/05/29/police-across-us-speak-out-against-minneapolis-custody-death/,en,False,,90694,wsls.com,http://www.wsls.com/#spider,"This tweet posted by Chief David Roddy of the Chattanooga, Tenn., Police Department is seen Thursday, May 28, 2020. Law enforcement officials nationwide have rushed to condemn the actions of Minneapolis officers in the death of a black man in custody, a wave of harsh criticism experts say is unprecedented. (Chattanooga Police Department via AP) LOS ANGELES – Murder. Brutality. Reprehensible. Indefensible. Police nationwide, in unequivocal and unprecedented language, have condemned the actions of Minneapolis police in the custody death of a handcuffed black man who cried for help as an officer knelt on his neck, pinning him to the pavement for at least eight minutes. But some civil rights advocates say their denunciations are empty words without meaningful reform behind them. Authorities say George Floyd was detained Monday because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, and the 46-year-old resisted arrest. A bystander's disturbing video shows Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd's neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. “There is no need to see more video,” Chattanooga, Tennessee, Police Chief David Roddy tweeted Wednesday. “There no need to wait to see how ‘it plays out’. There is no need to put a knee on someone’s neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don’t have an issue with this ... turn it in.” The reaction from some law enforcement stands in stark contrast to their muted response or support for police after other in-custody fatalities. Sheriffs and police chiefs have strongly criticized the Minneapolis officer on social media and praised the city’s police chief for his quick dismissal of four officers at the scene. Some even called for them to be criminally charged. “I am deeply disturbed by the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered in the street with other officers there letting it go on,” Polk County, Georgia, Sheriff Johnny Moats wrote on Facebook. “I can assure everyone, me or any of my deputies will never treat anyone like that as long as I’m Sheriff. This kind of brutality is terrible and it needs to stop. All Officers involved need to be arrested and charged immediately. Praying for the family.” Typically, police call for patience and calm in the wake of a use of force. They are reluctant to weigh in on episodes involving another agency, often citing ongoing investigations or due process. “Not going hide behind ‘not being there,’"" tweeted San Jose Police, California, Chief Eddie Garcia. ""I’d be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission. The act of one, impacts us all.” But Gloria Browne-Marshall, a civil rights attorney and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said she wouldn't be a “cheerleader” for a “handful” of chiefs who harshly decried the officers' behavior. “Any minute progress is seen as miraculous because so little has been done for so long,” she said. “It’s nothing close to progress or what outrage would be taking place if it was a white man as the victim of this assault.” Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter in Los Angeles, said she wasn't “particularly moved” by the relatively few police who voiced outrage. Abdullah said the three other officers who witnessed Chauvin's actions and did not intervene contributed to a long-standing system of police racism and oppression against people of color. “We’ve got to remember that it was not just Officer Chauvin who was sitting on George Floyd’s neck,” she said. Abdullah and hundreds of others protested what she called Floyd's lynching on Wednesday night. Some blocked lanes of a freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Minneapolis is bracing for more violence after days of civil unrest, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The governor on Thursday called in the National Guard. On Thursday night, protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon. The heads of the Los Angeles and Chicago departments — both of which have been rocked before by police brutality scandals — addressed Floyd's death and its potential effect on race relations between law enforcement and communities of color. Even the New York Police Department weighed in. Eric Garner died in the city in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and uttered the same words Floyd did: “I can't breathe.” It took city officials five years to fire the officer, and no criminal or federal charges were brought.

MINNEAPOLIS — Tensions continue to mount on night three of sustained demonstrations across the Twin Cities metro following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. While most of the protests have been peaceful, both honoring the late Floyd and the social justice movement, some factions have left vandalism, fires and looting in their wake. People rioting have breached the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct and set the building on fire as of reports coming in around 10:30 p.m. Thursday night. Minneapolis Police Spokesperson John Elder said in a statement that they had evacuated staff from the building due to safety concerns shortly after 10 p.m. According to Elder, ""Protesters forcibly entered the building and have ignited several fires."" Reporter Danny Spewak described the facility surrounded by flames on Twitter. The City of Minneapolis put out a tweet Thursday warning citizens to stay away from MPD's Third Precinct building, citing unconfirmed reports of cut gas lines and explosive materials in the building. Weighing in on Twitter, President Trump blamed the emergent social disturbance on a lack of local leadership, and threatened to send in the federal National Guard unless the city was brought under control. The president went on to tweet, ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"" In a 1 a.m. press conference Friday morning, Frey said rioting posed an imminent threat to the safety of the officers and staffers within MPD's Third Precinct, forcing him to make the decision to evacuate the compound. “Symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life or the public,” Frey said. “We could not risk serious injury to anyone … brick and mortar is not as important as life.” The Mayor went on to say that the people of the Third Precinct could continue to expect to see a police presence, and that public safety services and resources to the public would remain intact. However, he went on to say that progress during this crisis would not come from the government alone. “We additionally need help from the community. We need to make sure that people are looking out for our city right now. It's not just enough to do the right thing for yourself. We need to make sure that all of us are upholding the ideals that we stand by.” Although the mayor acknowledged the pain and frustration in recent days, he made it clear, the devastation is unacceptable. “What we have seen over the past couple of nights in terms of looting is unacceptable. These are businesses. These are community institutions that we need. These are banks that people rely on to get cash, grocery stores that people rely on to get food … We need to ensure that they are protected.” Frey said this is one of the most difficult situations the city of Minneapolis has ever been through, and that Minneapolis would pull through with a united front, stating both his chief of fire and chief of police have his 100% support. Earlier in the day, people had gathered at the intersection of 38th and Chicago in downtown Minneapolis at the scene of Floyd's death. In one location, Minneapolis artists worked to paint a mural of Floyd. ""Hopefully, it’s a reminder that this should never happen again, and people need to step up in every way that they can to stand up against these corrupt systems,"" said Xena Goldman, one of the artists. In Minneapolis, a powerful moment occurred. An entire crowd just went silent, took a knee and raised a fist in remembrance of George Floyd. Elsewhere, shopkeepers and business owners were forced to clean up in the wake of vandalism and fires that were reported throughout the Twin Cities. In one of the many examples, Gus from Augie’s in downtown Minneapoils off Hennepin Avenue told KARE 11 protesters shattered a door to the BuzzMart despite their pleas. Luckily he says they, and some of the crowd, deterred anyone from entering. Business owners along Lake Street in south Minneapolis spent Thursday cleaning up debris and boarding up windows after a night of protests, fires, looting and damage. Some business owners in south Minneapolis spent the previous night trying to protect their businesses from looters. Thursday night as more destruction spread, some businesses placed signs in their windows letting people know they were a minority-owned business.

Executive Order 20-65 authorizes the guard to work with local government agencies to provide ""personnel, equipment and facilities"" to help respond to the present emergency, according to a news release put out by the governor's office. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect. George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction. As George Floyd’s family has said, ‘Floyd would not want people to get hurt. He lived his life protecting people.’ Let’s come together to rebuild, remember, and seek justice for George Floyd,” said Governor Walz. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced Thursday that he had asked Walz to activate the guard to help local law enforcement, as protests escalated into violence and looting overnight Wednesday. In a statement put out on the Minnesota National Guard's Twitter handle, Major General Jon Jensen said, ""We are ready and prepared to answer the Governor's request. We are currently in process of assigning and preparing units to respond.""

According to the release, the state's response will be conducted from the State Emergency Operations Center. Already activated under the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the site will now serve the dual task of helping to coordinate public health needs, as well as addressing safety issues surrounding the evolving tensions in Minneapolis. Frey and other city officials held a news conference earlier Thursday to address protests and unrest happening across Minneapolis. “The emotion-ridden conflict over last night is the result of so much built-up anger and sadness,"" Frey said. ""Anger and sadness that has been ingrained in our black community, not just because of 5 minutes of horror, but 400 years.” Frey said that in the coming days there will be an all-out effort to restore peace in the city. City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins stepped to the podium and said people have rights to express their anger, but should not do so by causing violence. ""We need peace and calm in our streets and I am begging you for that,"" Jenkins said. ""I have spent the last 41 years as a resident of this city and this is my home. And we cannot allow outsiders or our own Minneapolitan residents to destroy our city. So we want to work together to ensure that people have their voices heard in a safe manner. And that's my commitment."" Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said he cannot allow criminal acts to threaten the safety of the city. He said he wants to create safe spaces for people to gather and grieve the death of George Floyd. ""I know that our community is in trauma and that they are trying to find ways to heal,"" Arradondo said. ""Even prior to Mr. Floyd's death we have had a community that has been in trauma for quite some time. What I cannot allow as chief is for others to compound that trauma."" Arradondo said most people gathered peacefully but that there were groups of people who were causing destruction. ""The vast majority of people that have come to gather have done so peacefully,"" Arradondo said. He added that there were people involved in the overnight unrest who did not appear to be local. ""There were certainly people who were involved in the activities last night who were certainly not recognized as being part of the city."" Mayor Frey added that businesses that were looted and damaged are ""staples in the community."" ""But more important, in the time of a pandemic they are essential for community needs,"" he said. Multiple buildings, including businesses, homes and a construction site were engulfed in flames Thursday morning as fire crews across Minneapolis worked to contain the blaze. The Minneapolis Fire Department says 911 logs show engines responded to approximately 30 fire events during the unrest along East Lake Street, including at least 16 that involved structures on fire. During those responses engines and equipment suffered damage from rocks and other objects thrown at them. Minneapolis fire personnel remain on scene Thursday putting down active fires and remaining hot spots. Fires broke out at businesses in the area of Lake Street after demonstrations following the police-involved death of Floyd turned chaotic. An AutoZone, a Cub Foods, and an apartment complex under construction were reportedly among the structures impacted by the fires. St. Paul Police spokesman Steve Linders confirmed that approximately 40 St. Paul officers had been deployed to protect and aid Minneapolis firefighters trying to put down the fires. Reports of looting and property damage began Wednesday night, as a peaceful protest following the death of George Floyd turned ""from bad to worse,"" according to KARE 11's Deevon Rahming, who was on scene for a number of hours. A spokesman for Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey confirms that the mayor has requested the assistance of the National Guard to help regain control of the situation. In other developments, multiple reports say the Rev. Jesse Jackson is headed for Minneapolis, and is expected to hold a news conference around 1 p.m. The Rev. Al Sharpton posted on his Twitter account that he is headed for the Twin Cities as well. Earlier Wednesday, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged people observing or participating in protests to do so with safety in mind.",0.0

Protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody Monday, broke out in Minneapolis for a third straight night. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) MINNEAPOLIS – The white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into George Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with murder, and crowds broke overnight curfews imposed to try to stem violent protests over police killings of African Americans that have spread to cities across the U.S. On Minneapolis' south side, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back crowds of protesters who then set cars and businesses on fire and broke into stores, including some near a police station. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence a day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. Protesters on Thursday torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and vandalized dozens of businesses. The Pentagon took the rare step Friday of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. Ben Hubert, 26, of Minneapolis, said he wasn’t surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. “I’m outraged,” he said of the Floyd case. “But I’m also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It’s been swelling for years.” Downtown, thousands of protesters encircled a police station after the 8 p.m. curfew. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” There was no violence, though some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. The renewed protests came after Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd, who was black, had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” As the night dragged on, more fires erupted on the south side: A Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank, another restaurant, an Office Depot. Many burned for hours. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted that firefighters could not respond until areas were secure. He said the city was working with the National Guard and the state to “provide support in the south.” Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country."" Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, the complaint said. Chauvin's attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case four days after Floyd’s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” in responding to this week's protests and called for swift justice for the officers. Walz said the state took the lead after the police station burned. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said. President Donald Trump said Friday that he'd spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow.” He called video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd's family, asked to take custody of Floyd's body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd's death. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Aaron Morrison and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, Bernard Condon in New York, and James LaPorta in Delray Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.",0.0

Brutality. Reprehensible. Indefensible. Police nationwide, in unequivocal and unprecedented language, have condemned the actions of Minneapolis police in the custody death of a handcuffed black man who cried for help as an officer knelt on his neck, pinning him to the pavement for at least eight minutes. But some civil rights advocates say their denunciations are empty words without meaningful reform behind them. Authorities say George Floyd was detained Monday because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, and the 46-year-old resisted arrest. A bystander's disturbing video shows Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd's neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. 'There is no need to see more video,' Chattanooga, Tennessee, Police Chief David Roddy tweeted Wednesday. 'There no need to wait to see how 'it plays out'. There is no need to put a knee on someone's neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don't have an issue with this ... turn it in.' The reaction from some law enforcement stands in stark contrast to their muted response or support for police after other in-custody fatalities. Sheriffs and police chiefs have strongly criticized the Minneapolis officer on social media and praised the city's police chief for his quick dismissal of four officers at the scene. Some even called for them to be criminally charged. 'I am deeply disturbed by the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered in the street with other officers there letting it go on,' Polk County, Georgia, Sheriff Johnny Moats wrote on Facebook. 'I can assure everyone, me or any of my deputies will never treat anyone like that as long as I'm Sheriff. This kind of brutality is terrible and it needs to stop. All Officers involved need to be arrested and charged immediately. Praying for the family.' Typically, police call for patience and calm in the wake of a use of force. They are reluctant to weigh in on episodes involving another agency, often citing ongoing investigations or due process. 'Not going hide behind 'not being there,'"" tweeted San Jose Police, California, Chief Eddie Garcia. ""I'd be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission. The act of one, impacts us all.' But Gloria Browne-Marshall, a civil rights attorney and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said she wouldn't be a 'cheerleader' for a 'handful' of chiefs who harshly decried the officers' behavior. 'Any minute progress is seen as miraculous because so little has been done for so long,' she said. 'It's nothing close to progress or what outrage would be taking place if it was a white man as the victim of this assault.' Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter in Los Angeles, said she wasn't 'particularly moved' by the relatively few police who voiced outrage. Abdullah said the three other officers who witnessed Chauvin's actions and did not intervene contributed to a long-standing system of police racism and oppression against people of color. 'We've got to remember that it was not just Officer Chauvin who was sitting on George Floyd's neck,' she said. Abdullah and hundreds of others protested what she called Floyd's lynching on Wednesday night. Some blocked lanes of a freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Minneapolis is bracing for more violence after days of civil unrest, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The governor on Thursday called in the National Guard. On Thursday night, protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon. The heads of the Los Angeles and Chicago departments "" both of which have been rocked before by police brutality scandals "" addressed Floyd's death and its potential effect on race relations between law enforcement and communities of color. Even the New York Police Department weighed in. Eric Garner died in the city in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and uttered the same words Floyd did: 'I can't breathe.' It took city officials five years to fire the officer, and no criminal or federal charges were brought. ""What we saw in Minnesota was deeply disturbing. It was wrong,"" NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea wrote Thursday. 'We must take a stand and address it. We must come together, condemn these actions and reinforce who we are as members of the NYPD. This is not acceptable ANYWHERE.' Before he was commissioner, Shea spearheaded the NYPD's shift to community policing that moved away from a more confrontational style favored by other commissioners after Garner's death.

U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said about 300,000 people in Hong Kong who hold British National (Overseas) passports will be able to stay in Britain for 12 months rather than the current six. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung) HONG KONG – Dozens of people protested in a mall in Hong Kong on Friday following a vote by China’s ceremonial parliament to approve legislation that could severely restrict opposition political activity and civil society in the Asian financial center. The protesters chanted slogans in the main atrium of the mall in the high-end Central district, some draping banners over the balconies with slogans such as “Independence for Hong Kong.” Police waited in vans parked prominently outside the mall but did not attempt to break up the gathering. Hundreds of people have been arrested during recent demonstrations that seek to revive the momentum of protests that shut down large parts of the city during the second half of last year. China's National People’s Congress on Thursday voted to approve the bill that will now be sent to its standing committee for final approval. Details of the final version of the law aren’t known, but China says it will prohibit separatist activities and actions that might threaten the Communist Party’s monopoly on political power in mainland China. Beijing and its supporters in Hong Kong are defending the legislative move against criticism from foreign countries, including the U.S., which has threatened to revoke special trade privileges granted to the former British colony when it was handed over to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” framework in which it was guaranteed its own political, legal, social and legal institutions for 50 years. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said China would not tolerate any interference in what it considers a strictly internal matter. “We advise the U.S. side to have a correct understanding of the situation and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs. If the U.S. insists on jeopardizing China’s interests, China will definitely take all necessary measures to fight back.” Tensions between the administration of President Donald Trump and China are already high over trade, human rights, China's threats against Taiwan and the coronavirus pandemic. Trump says he intends to make an announcement about China on Friday and officials say he is considering a proposal to revoke the visas of Chinese students affiliated with educational institutions in China that are linked to the People’s Liberation Army or Chinese intelligence. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday visited a Hong Kong bookstore that re-opened in Taipei after its part-owner was abducted to the Chinese mainland, in a show of support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and opposition to the national security law. Tsai told the bookstore owner, Lam Wing-kee, that her administration will “provide whatever help it could to our Hong Kong friends."" Taiwan this week said it will extend residency rights for Hong Kong residents who have moved to the self-governing island democracy in increasing numbers over the past year. Taiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang said the national security legislation is a clear sign that China is not sincere in carrying out the “one country, two systems"" policy it promised to Hong Kong and which it has proposed as a framework for unification with Taiwan. “They are entirely not making good on their promise. China's commitment to ‘one country, two systems' is nothing but empty talk,"" Su said. China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary.

(Carlos Gonzalez/Star Tribune via AP) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Cheering protesters torched a Minneapolis police station Thursday that the department was forced to abandon as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck. A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. A visibly tired and frustrated Frey made his first public appearance of the night at City Hall near 2 a.m. and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers there. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said Guard members were being stationed in locations to help stem looting, including banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving.

Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request, but it wasn’t immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was “here with the Minneapolis Fire Department” to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between officers and protesters but no widespread property damage. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes on Wednesday, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.",0.0

Ai Weiwei believes the newly passed national security law for Hong Kong augurs the end for the semi-autonomous city. (AP Photo/Park Juwon) SEOUL – Dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei believes the newly passed national security law for Hong Kong augurs the end for the semi-autonomous city. Ai was arrested at Beijing's airport in April 2011 and held for 81 days without explanation during a wider crackdown on dissent that coincided with the international ferment of the Arab Spring. In an interview with The Associated Press, Ai said he identifies with Hong Kong’s democracy movement and has been working on a documentary about protests that began a year ago, at times erupting into tear gas-shrouded combat between police and demonstrators. “I experienced every detail of who they (the protesters) are, how they fight and how this is going to end,” Ai said. “They are so determined and very pure. So those stories are really, really hurting me.” Many in Hong Kong fear their city will become like any other in mainland China after the National People's Congress in Beijing approved the national security law. It targets people and groups suspected of sedition or other threats to safety and security and follows recent arrests of many leading pro-democracy activists in the former British colony. According to Ai, the new measure is “not lawful” because even the Chinese state hasn't established “its own legitimacy of control.” China's communist leaders promised to allow Hong Kong to keep its own customs territory and financial system, laws and civil liberties for 50 years after Beijing took control in 1997. Critics of the new law say it may allow mainland security organs to interfere in local law enforcement, among other things. “So, China promised ‘one country, two systems’ for 50 years, now it’s far from that,” Ai said from his home in Cambridge, England. “They violated their own words. So, that’s more dangerous because once you’ve lost the trust of the international community, who’s going to (have a) dealing or have a business with someone like this?” “In old China, we have a word that means if you say something, it has to be trusted,"" he said. Hong Kong's status as a safe haven for dissent has been deteriorating for years, Ai said, pointing to abductions of business figures embroiled in mainland Chinese business disputes, among others. In one of the best known cases, five Hong Kong booksellers went missing in 2015 and were later found to have been detained in China for selling books critical of the government. “Many people still disappeared and nobody knows where they are,” he said. “So Hong Kong cannot allow this to happen.” Ai also mentioned the disappearance 25 years ago of a boy chosen by the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, to be Tibetan Buddhism’s second-highest figure. “Nobody knows where this lama is and where his family is. And all of those human rights lawyers disappeared,” Ai said. “I was disappeared,” he said, referring to his more than two months of detention in 2011. When Ai was released, it was announced that he had confessed to tax evasion and fined $2.4 million bill. He has since left China on his Chinese passport and legally has the right to return. His last visit to the Chinese mainland was a few months after he first left in July 2015, his studio said. Before protesters turned the glitzy financial center into a canvas of anti-government graffiti, Hong Kong was famous for its bustling art scene — home to the annual Art Basel and many independent galleries. When asked about Hong Kong's future, Ai said the definition of art has been changing amid the unrest. Protest itself is a form of art, he said. “When you see what happened in Hong Kong with the protesters, the way they organize through the internet, every day they would create hundreds of different posters so fast,"" he said. ""No any other art industry in the world can catch (up to) that kind of flexibility,” he said, referring to countless posters and graffiti slogans on Hong Kong’s once-spotless walls, concrete barriers, roads, and tram tracks. “Young people in Hong Kong, they are smart, they are rational, and they are very brave,” Ai said. “And then in some sense, they are very innocent, and naive, and they use their life to test out their ideology.” Ai’s no stranger to documenting current events. In 2003, he produced a documentary film called “Eat, Drink, and Be Merry,” capturing carefree moments of his brother and friends against the backdrop of SARS, an infectious respiratory disease that hit Asia in 2003. He has now turned his attention to Wuhan, the central Chinese city that became the origin of the coronavirus pandemic. Ai said his artist friends in Wuhan have been sending him footage, even from a hospital, giving him multi-angled glimpses of vulnerable and fleeting moments of the city during its unprecedented lockdown. “I think China has handled it better (than SARS) because they’re much more experienced,” Ai said. But he said there’s still a lack of transparency. “They (Chinese government) intentionally covered (up) the whole pandemic as a secret for many weeks,” Ai said. “In a certain sense, they will never change.”",0.0
1619946512,2020-05-29 06:13:00,Cliven Bundy Armed Standoff Case Going Back To Court,https://www.wmra.org/post/cliven-bundy-armed-standoff-case-going-back-court,en,False,,144825,wmra.org,http://wmra.org/,"It's been more than two years since Cliven Bundy left the federal courthouse in downtown Las Vegas a free man. His arm around his wife, Carol Bundy, the Nevada rancher was defiant. ""We're not done with this,"" Bundy told reporters in January 2018. ""If the federal government comes after us again we will definitely tell 'em the truth."" On Friday, the Justice Department will try to come after the Bundys again, when federal prosecutors will appeal for a retrial over a 2014 armed standoff between Bundy, his militia and federal agents who had come to round up the rancher's cows that were illegally grazing on federal land. The government's case against Cliven Bundy, his sons, Ammon and Ryan and a Montana militiaman named Ryan Payne, collapsed after a judge declared a mistrial in December 2017. Bundy and his men were accused of conspiracy against federal agents and other charges for their role in the tense standoff which later became a symbol over the fight against federal control of public lands. ""If there is no successful prosecution, it's going to encourage a lot of anarchists like the Bundys to take actions that not only are a threat to themselves but threats to the public at large,"" said Pat Shea, who served as BLM director during the Clinton administration. Retrial effort criticized For their part, the Bundys and their supporters appear puzzled that the federal government is even pursuing a retrial. ""What's really ironic and frankly I think disgusting is that the Trump Justice Department is the one that allowed the U.S. attorney in Nevada to take the appeal,"" said Larry Klayman, Cliven Bundy's attorney. After all, President Trump recently pardoned two Oregon ranchers whose fight with federal land managers inspired Cliven Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, to lead a separate, armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016. Federal prosecutors mostly failed to get convictions in that Oregon case and have been widely criticized for bungling the Nevada trial. Judge Gloria Navarro dismissed the case and later declared a mistrial after ruling federal prosecutors ""deliberately misled"" defense attorneys and the court by failing to provide evidence from surveillance cameras and to disclose the existence of federal snipers near the ranch in the days leading up to the April 2014 standoff. The U.S. attorney's office in Nevada declined an interview request by NPR. But court filings indicate prosecutors will likely argue Friday that their missteps in the 2017 trial were ""inadvertent,"" and in particular they say they were trying to balance disclosing Bureau of Land Management surveillance footage with protecting witnesses against violence. Klayman, who is himself a controversial conservative activist and was once fixture in the ""Birther"" movement, says the DOJ is being hypocritical. He says the investigation against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was recently dropped, but not his clients. ""If you're one of the Washington elite and establishment in the nation's capital, you get special treatment,"" Klayman said. ""If you're Cliven Bundy and his sons and the peaceful protesters, basically you don't."" Most of the federal agents and land managers who were at the 2014 standoff say it was anything but a peaceful protest. Photos and social media posts showed militia training their rifles on armed BLM officers who had come to round up Bundy's cattle. Cliven Bundy has refused to recognize the federal government's ownership of millions of acres of public land — including in Nevada. The rancher has consequently not paid federal fees owed for grazing his cows on land near the Lake Mead National Recreation Area since the 1990s. Pandemic ""resuscitates"" movement Retired federal land managers like Pat Shea have expressed outrage over the government's continued failure to prosecute the Bundys, whose cows continue to graze — for free — on land that's now protected as a national monument. The Bundys' original dispute over grazing goes back decades, stemming from tensions between ranchers and environmentalists and the city of Las Vegas, as it began rapidly expanding into a protected desert tortoise's habitat. Bundy was seen as the last rancher in southern Nevada who refused to get out of the business. But in the years since, his critics say the family's fight has devolved into far right extremism, and a widely debunked legal theory that counties and states, not the federal government, should own public land. ""It's like the COVID-19 virus, they mutate as to their belief system so much that you can never tell what they're going to advocate,"" Shea said. ""They are a danger to themselves and a danger to everyone else they come in contact with."" Indeed, the pandemic has lately brought an opportunity to breathe new life to the Bundys and their self-described patriot movement that had been seen as starting to fade. Ammon Bundy and some of the family's followers have been traveling across the West leading protests against coronavirus public health restrictions, protests that thus far haven't drawn huge numbers. At one recent march in Washington state that was streamed on Facebook, activist Kelli Stewart decried the business closures: ""Come on guys, this is the American way, open rebellion to tyrannical laws, we're not slaves."" A rebellious fight against tyranny, or justice against a family that has flaunted the law for decades, that's a question now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The court takes up the appeal for a retrial in USA vs. Bundy in a virtual session on Friday. ",0.0

The demonstration began as a peaceful protest, but news outlets reported protesters began throwing objects like water bottles at officers, who responded by using tear gas on the crowd. A scuffle between a protester and an officer broke out around 9:45 p.m., WCMH-TV reported. Some protesters attempted to breach the Ohio Statehouse later Thursday, the TV station reported, sharing photographs of what appeared to be smashed windows at the statehouse.

'I understand why some residents are angry and taking to the streets. I have said many times that racism exists across the country, state and right here in Columbus. We are committed to addressing racism wherever we see it,' Mayor Andrew Ginther tweeted before 9 p.m. 'I respect peaceful protests and ask residents to remain peaceful in their actions tonight and every night.' Earlier Thursday, video showed the crowd marching down Broad Street and blocking High Street, two downtown arteries near the statehouse. As they marched, protesters engaged in a call-and-response chant: 'Say his name,"" followed by 'George Floyd.' Demonstrators also chanted, 'Black lives matter' and 'I can't breathe.' The Dispatch reported that protesters dispersed by pepper spray broke windows along South High Street and broke into the DGX store, a subsidiary of Dollar General, on the street. Photographs from the Dispatch showed a smashed storefront at the Einstein Bros. Bagels shop across the street from the statehouse.

At least seven people were shot during the protest. (Jada W. via AP) LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — At least seven people were shot in Louisville as protesters turned out to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March. Louisville Metro Police confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn’t provide a number. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city’s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. The protests continued for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. At one point, protesters took turns hoisting the stone hand of King Louis XVI after it was broken off his statue outside City Hall. Shots were later heard, prompting some of the protesters to scramble for safety. “Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post that appealed for people to remain non-violent as they demand justice and accountability from police. “As Breonna’s mother says let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice,” the mayor wrote. Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. Attention on Taylor’s death has intensified after her family sued the police department this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February. Thursday’s demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody. Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor’s family. “Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna’s name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.” Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” A small fire inside a trash can was visible in the middle of the street. Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up downtown. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd. Protesters recorded officers with their cellphones. Kentuckians are still under social distancing mandates driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Many protesters wore masks. Chants early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.”",0.0

Law enforcement officials nationwide have rushed to condemn the actions of Minneapolis officers in the death of a black man in custody, a wave of harsh criticism experts say is unprecedented. (Chattanooga Police Department via AP) LOS ANGELES (AP) — Murder. Brutality. Reprehensible. Indefensible. Police nationwide, in unequivocal and unprecedented language, have condemned the actions of Minneapolis police in the custody death of a handcuffed black man who cried for help as an officer knelt on his neck, pinning him to the pavement for at least eight minutes. But some civil rights advocates say their denunciations are empty words without meaningful reform behind them. Related: Hampton Roads police departments respond to death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis Police custody Authorities say George Floyd was detained Monday because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, and the 46-year-old resisted arrest. A bystander’s disturbing video shows Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. “There is no need to see more video,” Chattanooga, Tennessee, Police Chief David Roddy tweeted Wednesday. “There no need to wait to see how ‘it plays out’. There is no need to put a knee on someone’s neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don’t have an issue with this … turn it in.” The reaction from some law enforcement stands in stark contrast to their muted response or support for police after other in-custody fatalities. Sheriffs and police chiefs have strongly criticized the Minneapolis officer on social media and praised the city’s police chief for his quick dismissal of four officers at the scene. Some even called for them to be criminally charged. “I am deeply disturbed by the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered in the street with other officers there letting it go on,” Polk County, Georgia, Sheriff Johnny Moats wrote on Facebook. “I can assure everyone, me or any of my deputies will never treat anyone like that as long as I’m Sheriff. This kind of brutality is terrible and it needs to stop. All Officers involved need to be arrested and charged immediately. Praying for the family.” Typically, police call for patience and calm in the wake of a use of force. They are reluctant to weigh in on episodes involving another agency, often citing ongoing investigations or due process. “Not going hide behind ‘not being there,’” tweeted San Jose Police, California, Chief Eddie Garcia. “I’d be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission. The act of one, impacts us all.” But Gloria Browne-Marshall, a civil rights attorney and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said she wouldn’t be a “cheerleader” for a “handful” of chiefs who harshly decried the officers’ behavior. “Any minute progress is seen as miraculous because so little has been done for so long,” she said. “It’s nothing close to progress or what outrage would be taking place if it was a white man as the victim of this assault.” Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter in Los Angeles, said she wasn’t “particularly moved” by the relatively few police who voiced outrage. Abdullah said the three other officers who witnessed Chauvin’s actions and did not intervene contributed to a long-standing system of police racism and oppression against people of color. “We’ve got to remember that it was not just Officer Chauvin who was sitting on George Floyd’s neck,” she said. Abdullah and hundreds of others protestedwhat she called Floyd’s lynching on Wednesday night. Some blocked lanes of a freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Minneapolis is bracing for more violence after days of civil unrest, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The governor on Thursday called in the National Guard. On Thursday night, protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon. The heads of the Los Angeles and Chicago departments — both of which have been rocked before by police brutality scandals — addressed Floyd’s death and its potential effect on race relations between law enforcement and communities of color. Even the New York Police Department weighed in. Eric Garner died in the city in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and uttered the same words Floyd did: “I can’t breathe.” It took city officials five years to fire the officer, and no criminal or federal charges were brought. “What we saw in Minnesota was deeply disturbing. It was wrong,” NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea wrote Thursday. “We must take a stand and address it. We must come together, condemn these actions and reinforce who we are as members of the NYPD. This is not acceptable ANYWHERE.” Before he was commissioner, Shea spearheaded the NYPD’s shift to community policing that moved away from a more confrontational style favored by other commissioners after Garner’s death. Harris County, Texas, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, who also spoke out online, told The Associated Press that law enforcement agencies keep promising reforms in the wake of fatalities, but they are “not delivering it on a consistent basis.” “When bad things happen in our profession, we need to be able to call it like it is,” he said. “We keep thinking that the last one will be the last one, and then another one surfaces.”",0.0

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. Trump, who called protesters in Minneapolis “thugs,” drew another warning from Twitter for his rhetoric, saying it violated the platform’s rules about “glorifying violence.” A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night at City Hall near 2 a.m. Friday and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers there. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” A protester carries the carries a U.S. flag upside, a sign of distress, next to a burning building Thursday, May 28, 2020, in Minneapolis.

I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were being stationed in locations to help stem looting, including banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. On Friday morning, the Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew as they reported on the unrest in Minneapolis. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also led away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Atlanta-based CNN said that the crew, which included CNN reporter Omar Jimenez, was released later Friday morning. While live on air, Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also led away in handcuffs. #BREAKING: Rioters have taking over 3rd precinct police station #Minneapolis and set it on fire, helicopter saving officers on the roof. #GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/Q5vSgxU0Yz — Jack Dawkins (@DawkinsReturns) May 29, 2020 CNN’s communications team earlier said on Twitter that the crew was arrested “for doing their jobs, despite identifying themselves — a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” The Minnesota State Patrol said on Twitter that the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order.” The patrol said they “were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media.” Late Thursday in Minneapolis, cheering protesters torched a police station that the department abandoned as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S. Thick smoke rose over the city as fires burned Friday morning. Firefighters worked to contain a number of fires as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. A couple dozen Guard members, armed with assault-style rifles, blocked a street Friday morning near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. Fire larger now . Third precinct has no police presence now.

But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” NAPA collapsed, firefighters trying to save that deli next door pic.twitter.com/9OImZILpes — Nick Ferraro (@NFerraroPiPress) May 29, 2020 The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between officers and protesters but no widespread property damage. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Anger over the killing also has spread in Africa, where the head of the African Union Commission on Friday rejected “continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the USA.” In a series of tweets, Moussa Faki Mahamat urged the “total elimination” of all forms of racism in the U.S. In Mississippi, Petal Mayor Hal Marx resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. The Republican on Twitter asked “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” and in a follow-up tweet said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes on Wednesday, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard.",0.0

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) DENVER (AP) — Protesters swarmed Denver on Thursday, blocking traffic and smashing vehicles while running from gunfire and police tear gas after a demonstration against the death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody turned violent. Hundreds of demonstrators stood in the downtown streets and chanted as darkness fell outside the Colorado State Capitol, where protesters spray-painted graffiti and broke car windows. In other areas of downtown Denver, police in riot gear fired gas canisters, used rubber bullets and walked in a phalanx through the streets to drive protesters away. The protest briefly spilled over onto Interstate 25, blocking all lanes of traffic until police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. The protests continued into the night, despite Denver Mayor Michael Hancock pleading for calm. “I certainly understand everyone’s frustration and sense of pain and disgust following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis,” he said in a video posted on Twitter. “But I want to plead to everyone. Let’s demonstrate, but let’s demonstrate peacefully. Leave the weapons home.” Earlier in the protest, gunfire outside the state Capitol sent people running for cover. Gary Cutler, a spokesman for the Colorado State Patrol, said the shots were fired in a park across the street. Most of the protesters already had left the area and were marching downtown. Cutler said the Capitol building was locked down, and everyone inside was safe. No injuries have been reported from the shots. State Rep. Leslie Herod, who was protesting at the Capitol, tweeted, “We just got shot at.” She later said, “We will not be deterred by this unspeakable act of violence.” Police spokesman Kurt Barnes said it’s unclear if the protesters were being targeted, and no one has been arrested. About six or seven shots were fired, he said. Several hundred protesters had gathered to call for justice following the death of Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on Monday after an officer knelt on his neck for almost eight minutes. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Some among the Denver protesters carried signs reading “Black Lives Matter” and chanted, “Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Racist police got to go.” Aerial footage showed several protesters smashing the windows out of at least two vehicles parked outside the Capitol, and others spray-painted graffiti on the Capitol steps. A cellphone video shot by protester Anabel Escobar, 29, showed a man on the hood of an SUV making its way through the crowd in front of the Capitol. The video showed the driver speeding up and then apparently trying to run the man over after he fell off the hood. The vehicle sped away as other protesters chased it. It was unclear if the man on the hood was injured. Gov. Jared Polis said Thursday night he was “absolutely shocked” by the video. “Coloradans are better than this,” he said. “I share the immense anguish we all feel about the unjust murder of George Floyd. But let me be clear, senseless violence will never be healed by more violence.” As the protest started, The Denver Police Department tweeted a message from Chief Paul Pazen sending condolences to Floyd’s family and saying the city’s officers do not use the tactics employed by the Minneapolis officers. He called that type of force “inexcusable.” Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired, and the mayor has called for the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck to be criminally charged. The death has led to violent protests in Minneapolis and demonstrations in other cities, including Los Angeles.",0.0

(@mckinley_moore via AP) LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — At least seven people were shot in Louisville as protesters turned out to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March. Louisville Metro Police confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn’t provide a number. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city’s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. The protests continued for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. At one point, protesters took turns hoisting the stone hand of King Louis XVI after it was broken off his statue outside City Hall. Shots were later heard, prompting some of the protesters to scramble for safety. “Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post that appealed for people to remain non-violent as they demand justice and accountability from police. “As Breonna’s mother says let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice,” the mayor wrote. Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. Attention on Taylor’s death has intensified after her family sued the police department this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February. Thursday’s demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody. Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor’s family. “Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna’s name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.” Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” A small fire inside a trash can was visible in the middle of the street. Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up downtown. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd. Protesters recorded officers with their cellphones. Kentuckians are still under social distancing mandates driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Many protesters wore masks. Chants early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.”",0.0
1620023693,2020-05-29 08:28:25,"Trump tweets ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts’. Twitter adds ‘glorifying violence’ warning",https://www.wfxrtv.com/news/trump-tweets-when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts-twitter-adds-glorifying-violence-warning/,en,True,,576666,virginiafirst.com,http://virginiafirst.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday called protesters in Minneapolis “thugs” and said that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” — drawing another warning from Twitter for his rhetoric. Trump tweeted after protesters outraged by the death of a black man in police custody torched a police station. Earlier Thursday, Trump said, “I feel very, very badly” about George Floyd’s death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. “That’s a very shocking sight.” It was the kind of personal statement expected from a president in response to the disturbing video of a black man gasping for help as a white policeman pinned him to the street by the neck. But it was a very different tone for Trump, who has often been silent in the face of white-on-black violence and has a long history of defending police. Trump’s language got more aggressive as violence boiled over in Minneapolis on Thursday night. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” he tweeted. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” Twitter added a warning to Trump’s tweet about the Minneapolis protests, saying it violated the platform’s rules about “glorifying violence.” Earlier this week, it applied fact checks to two of his tweets about mail-in ballots. Once more likely to hew to the “blue lives matter” mantra, Trump and his allies have been questioning an officer’s conduct and calling for justice for Floyd. But some activists doubt that Trump has suddenly evolved on the issue of police brutality and instead see election year political calculations. “This is the first race-tinged case that I’ve ever heard him address” as president, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and Trump critic who has known the president for decades. “So therefore he cannot be upset when people feel that it’s empty words because it is so out of character.” Trump has been silent on a number of high-profile police-involved killings, including that of Stephon Clark, a black man shot by Sacramento, California, police in 2018. “This is something that is a local matter and that’s something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities,” then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time. Trump has never addressed the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold by police trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes. Video of the encounter was viewed millions of times online, and Garner’s dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has, however, invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect. Trump has a long history of injecting himself into racially sensitive cases. In 1989, he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of a brutal assault on a jogger. Trump has never apologized, telling reporters last year: “You have people on both sides of that.” Trump also spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And he has even appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. But Trump’s tone has changed in recent weeks as he has repeatedly expressed dismay at footage of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man fatally shot in February in Georgia while jogging. “You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends,” he told reporters this month. “It’s a heartbreaking thing.” The president has notably left open the possibility of some other explanation, saying: “it could be something that we didn’t see on tape.” Trump and his allies have been even clearer on the death of Floyd, who can be heard and seen on tape pleading that he couldn’t breathe before he slowly stops talking and moving. Trump “was very upset when he saw that video,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. “He wants justice to be served.” Trump’s conservative allies also rallied to the cause. Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity said he is “a big supporter of law enforcement” but expressed outrage Wednesday, telling his audience: “The lack of training here is breathtaking.” “We got to get to the very bottom of how this poor individual was treated, and the death of him on the video itself is shocking from what I saw,” Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said. Even conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who once called Black Lives Matter a “terrorist group,” said Floyd’s death was totally “unjustified” and he was “so mad.” The outpouring comes as the Trump campaign has sought to chip into the advantage Democrats have with black voters. The campaign hopes either to win enough black support to keep pivotal states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in play or minimize enthusiasm for Democratic rival Joe Biden. There could be a small window after Biden last week told a prominent black radio host that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black,” a gaffe he later said he regretted. Trump and his allies have seized on that and other Biden statements, even though Biden, who served as vice president under the nation’s first black president, remains deeply popular among black voters, who helped him secure the Democratic nomination. Indeed, a recent Fox News poll found that just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, versus 75% who have a favorable view of Biden. Chris White, the longtime director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, questioned the sincerity of Republicans’ response to the deaths of Arbery and Floyd. The White House and Department of Justice have long had the power to address these issues. “Any time we hear politicians speaking about dealing with police brutality in the middle of election year, it’s just meaningless rhetoric that has a hollow promise,” he said. Sharpton credited both the magnitude of outrage in response to Floyd’s death as well as the upcoming election for the changed approach. But he doubted many black voters will be swayed with an approach they may see as too little, too late. “It’s like a father that misses a kid’s graduation of high school, graduation of college,” he said. “He can’t be upset when the kid looks at him suspiciously when he’s there when he graduates with his Ph.D.”",0.0

The incident occurred Thursday evening on Broadway near the Colorado state Capitol. The footage was taken by Annabel Escobar. It is about 21 seconds long. At the beginning, a man can be seen on the hood of a Ford Edge. There are several other protesters surrounding the vehicle. As the SUV moved forward, the man fell from the hood. The vehicle’s driver then turned to the right and struck the man. The driver then took off, heading southbound on Broadway. Thursday’s demonstrations were in response to the death of George Floyd, a man who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer earlier this week. In Denver, the protests turned violent and forced street closures throughout central parts of the city. Vehicles at the state Capitol were damaged, and the building itself was vandalized.

Hong Kong has been living on borrowed time ever since the British made it a colony nearly 180 years ago, and all the more so after Beijing took control in 1997, granting it autonomous status. A national security law approved by China's legislature Thursday is a reminder that the city's special status is in the hands of Communist Party leaders who have spent decades building their own trade and financial centers to take Hong Kong's place. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung) BANGKOK – Hong Kong has been living on borrowed time ever since the British made it a colony nearly 180 years ago, and all the more so after Beijing took control in 1997 and granted it autonomous status. China’s passage of a national security law for the city is the latest sign that the 50-year “one country, two systems” arrangement that allowed Hong Kong to keep its own legal, financial and trade regimes is perishable. China’s communist leaders have been preparing for decades to take full control of the glittering capitalist oasis, while building up their own trade and financial centers to take Hong Kong's place. For them, national security and patriotism trump the civil liberties that brought millions of Hong Kong residents into the streets last year, hoping to protect their own vision for their future — protests that would not be tolerated across the border. In the early 1980s, as China's own economy began to open up to trade and investment after decades of Cold War isolation and political upheaval, the contrast between the mainland and Hong Kong was evident on crossing the border into the bucolic rice paddies and fish ponds of Shenzhen. Several generations later, Shenzhen is a metropolis of skyscrapers, high-tech campuses and huge, modern ports that dwarf Hong Kong's own, at least in trading volume. Railways, roads, bridges and other infrastructure have transformed the Pearl River Delta region that surrounds it into a whole ecosystem of built-up cities that is China’s answer to Silicon Valley and then some. It also is home to increasingly influential tech companies like Huawei Technologies and Tencent. “Hong Kong is a Chinese city,"" said Kenneth Courtis, an expert on Asian economies and chairman of Starfort Investment Holdings. Instead of Hong Kong transforming its neighbors in Guangdong province, he said, “it's more likely that Hong Kong will be more and more absorbed into Guangdong."" The rise of industrial and financial centers like Shenzhen and Shanghai has sidelined Hong Kong in other respects. The city accounts for less than 3% of China's economic activity, down from a peak of 27% in 1993, the height of its role as go-between in China's ascent as an export powerhouse. China’s promise to leave Hong Kong’s own legal and economic systems intact for 50 years, until 2047, has helped the city of 7 million retain its attraction as a regional financial hub and bastion of Western-style civil liberties. The national security law endorsed in Beijing followed recent arrests of Hong Kong pro-democracy advocates. Critics say it will undermine civil liberties and might be used to suppress political activity, and many in Hong Kong reacted with dismay. Many of the millions of Hong Kong citizens who turned out in protests that began a year ago either escaped from the mainland or have parents that left decades ago. Having fled communist rule, they are clinging to liberties forbidden in mainland China, where public dissent is treated as subversive and punishable by long prison terms. “The most frightening thing is that you will never be able to know exactly what would cross the bottom line for the Chinese Communist Party, or even where that bottom line is. No one knows,"" said Philip Chan, who was walking in downtown Hong Kong's Central district under the watchful eyes of masses of police in riot gear, a common sight nowadays. Hong Kong’s government has insisted that the new security law will only affect a small minority of people, saying that life will continue as normal for most. The city's tycoons planted the seeds both for its success and its eventual undoing when they invested billions in Guangdong, across the border, taking advantage of special incentives and cheap labor, and eventually helping turn China into the world's factory floor. For the most part, those ultra-wealthy elites have sought to keep the peace with Beijing in return for wielding enormous influence both in local politics and business. Billionaire Li Ka-shing, whose fortune has taken a hit over the past year as Hong Kong's economy stumbled, told local media that he viewed Beijing's moves as its “sovereign right."" He and his peers have voiced support for the security legislation, saying they hope it will help ensure public order. Beijing's insistence on enacting the national security law, among other measures including now-tabled extradition legislation that sparked months of anti-government protests last year, prompted Washington to announce it no longer will treat Hong Kong as being autonomous from Beijing. It’s unclear whether the Trump administration will push ahead with the threat to no longer treat Hong Kong as an autonomous free port or how big the impact of such a move would be. Hong Kong accounted for about 8% of China's exports to the U.S. and about 6% of its imports from the U.S. in 2018, but its overall role in trade has been eclipsed by big ports to the north. The city was the world's second-biggest port after Singapore in 2005 and now is the eighth-largest: Shanghai is by far the biggest and its throughput has doubled during that time while Hong Kong's has fallen. The city is utterly dependent on the mainland for much of its water, most of its food, and to a large extent, tourism and investment. Before the protests and later the coronavirus pandemic virtually wiped out tourism, the city was a thriving cosmopolitan destination. It's a shopping and dining mecca with a vibrant cultural scene, strong traditions of philanthropy and historic preservation, and mass media and educational institutions largely unfettered by Communist Party dogma and censorship. At the same time, tensions have been building as the gap between rich and poor has widened. Political sentiment has become polarized as Beijing gradually extended its influence by ensuring its supporters would hold the deciding votes over such decisions as who would be the city's top leader. “These issues are very much central to the demonstrations,"" Courtis said. “Beijing would be very smart to address some of these issues. Repression isn't the answer."" While many in Hong Kong grew frustrated with disruptions from the anti-government protests that turned violent at times, still more have shown with the votes they are able to cast that they favor more, not less democracy. Some gathered in pop-up demonstrations Friday, including dozens who chanted in protest in the busy IFC shopping mall downtown. Jerome Lau, 70, said he feared the government would crack down on public gatherings and free speech. “Until I take my last breath, I will come out and fight for freedom,"" he said. —- Associated Press journalists Alice Fung and Magnum Chan in Hong Kong contributed.",0.0

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. Trump, who called protesters in Minneapolis “thugs,” drew another warning from Twitter for his rhetoric, saying it violated the platform’s rules about “glorifying violence.” A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night at City Hall near 2 a.m. Friday and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers there. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” A protester carries the carries a U.S. flag upside, a sign of distress, next to a burning building Thursday, May 28, 2020, in Minneapolis.

I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were being stationed in locations to help stem looting, including banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. On Friday morning, the Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew as they reported on the unrest in Minneapolis. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also led away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Atlanta-based CNN said that the crew, which included CNN reporter Omar Jimenez, was released later Friday morning. While live on air, Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also led away in handcuffs. #BREAKING: Rioters have taking over 3rd precinct police station #Minneapolis and set it on fire, helicopter saving officers on the roof. #GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/Q5vSgxU0Yz — Jack Dawkins (@DawkinsReturns) May 29, 2020 CNN’s communications team earlier said on Twitter that the crew was arrested “for doing their jobs, despite identifying themselves — a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” The Minnesota State Patrol said on Twitter that the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order.” The patrol said they “were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media.” Late Thursday in Minneapolis, cheering protesters torched a police station that the department abandoned as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S. Thick smoke rose over the city as fires burned Friday morning. Firefighters worked to contain a number of fires as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. A couple dozen Guard members, armed with assault-style rifles, blocked a street Friday morning near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. Fire larger now . Third precinct has no police presence now.

But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” NAPA collapsed, firefighters trying to save that deli next door pic.twitter.com/9OImZILpes — Nick Ferraro (@NFerraroPiPress) May 29, 2020 The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between officers and protesters but no widespread property damage. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Anger over the killing also has spread in Africa, where the head of the African Union Commission on Friday rejected “continuing discriminatory practices against black citizens of the USA.” In a series of tweets, Moussa Faki Mahamat urged the “total elimination” of all forms of racism in the U.S. In Mississippi, Petal Mayor Hal Marx resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. The Republican on Twitter asked “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” and in a follow-up tweet said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes on Wednesday, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard.",0.0
1620159659,2020-05-29 10:46:58.282529,7 shot at Louisville protest over fatal police shooting,https://www.whsv.com/content/news/7-shot-at-Louisville-protest-over-fatal-police-shooting-570858231.html,en,True,,80667,whsv.com,http://www.whsv.com/#spider,"Looking to defuse anger after gunfire wounded at least seven people at a protest in Louisville, the mother of a black woman killed by police urged protesters Friday to continue demanding justice but do so “without hurting each other.” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor’s mother hours after gunshots erupted during protests late Thursday outside City Hall. One person was in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police said Friday. Mayor Greg Fischer said police officers fired no shots. Instead, they provided aid to the wounded, he said. TV video showed terrified protesters fleeing as gunfire erupted. With more rallies planned, Taylor's mother joined the chorus of calls for protests to remain peaceful. In her statement, Tamika Palmer said her daughter — an emergency medical technician — devoted her life to others and the ""last thing she'd want right now is any more violence."" ""Please keep saying her name,"" her statement said. ""Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let's do it the right way without hurting each other. We can and we will make some real change here. Now is the time. Let's make it happen, but safely."" On Friday evening, what appeared to be several hundred people gathered downtown for the second night of protests. The crowd briefly blocked traffic near City Hall and chanted, ""No justice, no peace."" Protesters carried signs calling for justice for Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, the black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported. A police officer was seen on camera during a WAVE-TV broadcast firing what appeared to be pepper bullets directly at the camera crew. ""I'm getting shot! I'm getting shot!"" WAVE-TV reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera. She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away. Police spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said no shots had been fired at Friday's protest as of 10:40 p.m. and no significant injuries had been reported. Two people were arrested. Bracing for more protests, police said they wouldn't tolerate violence or property destruction. ""We value the right to free speech and understand this community has a lot to say right now,"" Louisville police Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous said. ""We hear you."" But she added that police were prepared to ""take whatever action we must to try to ensure no one else is injured during this time of unrest. We ask the community to please voice your opinions in a peaceful way."" Meanwhile, Louisville's mayor said the use of no-knock warrants by police was being suspended, the latest in a series of policy changes and others actions in response to Taylor's death. ""To the people who gathered downtown last night to protest, and to many more throughout our city and throughout our country who feel angry, hurt, afraid, frustrated, tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law enforcement, I hear you,"" Fischer said. Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, he said. Beshear, speaking on CNN, said Thursday's protest started peacefully but some people later ""turned it into something that it should not have been."" Local Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey termed the protest as ""a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed,"" the Courier Journal reported. ""What I'm seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration."" The Louisville protests followed the release of a 911 call Taylor’s boyfriend made on March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. Hundreds of demonstrators marched through downtown Louisville, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. Windows were broken and several vehicles were damaged during the unrest, police said. Shots were fired into government buildings, including police headquarters, they said. Bricks were thrown into buildings and graffiti was splashed in several places, including a firefighter memorial, they said. The police description of the damage made no reference to any looting. Jordan Basham, a 24-year-old white bartender, said she was a few feet from where the people were shot. As people fled in terror, a man she didn't know pushed her to the ground, told her not to move and used his own body to shield her, she said Friday. ""I'll never be able to get that picture out of my mind,"" she said. ""But I am still very glad that I was there. As long as they're out there protesting, I'll be back."" Many protesters wore masks as Kentuckians are strongly urged to follow health guidelines to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Attention on Taylor's death has intensified since her family sued the police department this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia in February and the recent death of Floyd. Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

(Facebook/Darnella Frazier/CNN) On Minneapolis' south side, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back crowds of protesters who then set cars and businesses on fire and broke into stores, including some near a police station. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence a day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. Protesters on Thursday torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and vandalized dozens of businesses. The Pentagon took the rare step Friday of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. Ben Hubert, 26, of Minneapolis, said he wasn't surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. ""I'm outraged,"" he said of the Floyd case. ""But I'm also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It's been swelling for years."" Downtown, thousands of protesters encircled a police station after the 8 p.m. curfew. ""Prosecute the police!"" some chanted, and ""Say his name: George Floyd!"" There was no violence, though some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. The renewed protests came after Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd, who was black, had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd's family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities ""felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator."" As the night dragged on, more fires erupted on the south side: A Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank, another restaurant, an Office Depot. Many burned for hours. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted that firefighters could not respond until areas were secure. He said the city was working with the National Guard and the state to ""provide support in the south."" Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd's death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. ""You are disgracing our city,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. ""You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country."" Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd's back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, ""No, staying put is where we got him."" Lane said he was ""worried about excited delirium or whatever."" An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as ""awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself."" After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, the complaint said. Chauvin's attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the ""extraordinary speed"" in charging the case four days after Floyd's death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the ""horrible"" video recorded by a bystander. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the ""abject failure"" in responding to this week's protests and called for swift justice for the officers. Walz said the state took the lead after the police station burned. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said. President Donald Trump said Friday that he'd spoken to Floyd's family and ""expressed my sorrow."" He called video of the arrest ""just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it."" Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd's family, asked to take custody of Floyd's body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd's death. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Aaron Morrison and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, Bernard Condon in New York, and James LaPorta in Delray Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.

Protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody Monday, broke out in Minneapolis for a third straight night. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) MINNEAPOLIS – The Latest on the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck (all times local): 6:25 p.m. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol says it dispatched a drone to Minneapolis following three nights of violent protests there but ended up sending it back to its base because the unmanned aerial vehicle wasn’t needed. The agency, which typically patrols the nation’s border and ports of entry, said the drone was going to provide live video to assist law enforcement in Minneapolis as they responded to protests that have left dozens of stores burned and looted. A CBP statement issued Friday says the drone would have provided “situational awareness” to local law enforcement. It said it routinely conducts such operations if needed to help other agencies or during natural disasters. The drone returned to its base in Grand Forks, North Dakota, after “the requesting agency determined that the aircraft was no longer needed for operational awareness.” CBP did not identify the agency that requested the assistance. ___ 5:25 p.m. President Donald Trump says he talked to members of George Floyd’s family on Friday and “expressed my sorrow.” Trump spoke about his conversation with members of the Floyd family during a White House meeting with businesses executives. He says of the encounter with police captured on video that “it was just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Trump says the family grieved during the call and that “I could see very much that they loved their brother.” Trump was also asked about his tweet saying “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” He says he had heard that phrase for a long time, but didn’t know where it originated. He says the phrase is “very accurate in the sense that, when you do have looting like you had last night, people often get shot and they die. And that’s not good and we don’t want that to happen.” Trump also spoke about the looters, saying they did a great disservice to their state, city and the country. He said “we can never let that happen again.” The president also says of the city and its mayor “I don’t think they were very well prepared. But we brought in the National Guard. They will be very prepared tonight.” ___ 4:45 p.m. Police in Memphis, Tennessee, are investigating whether an officer broke any rules after a video surfaced of a woman being knocked to the ground during a protest related to the death of George Floyd. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. That officer was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland said on social media Friday that he’s asked Police Director Michael Rallings to investigate “an event that occurred Wednesday night with one of our officers and a female protester.” A video has been shared on television and social media that appears to show an officer shoving a woman to the ground. It’s not clear whether she was injured. ___ 4:15 p.m. NBA veteran Stephen Jackson says he'll use his platform and “everything I have to get a conviction” for the four Minneapolis police officers who were fired after George Floyd’s death. Jackson, like Floyd, is from Houston and they were friends. The handcuffed black man died after pleading for air as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. That officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The charges were announced shortly after Jackson spoke at a news conference organized by activists at Minneapolis City Hall. Actor Jamie Foxx and Minnesota Timberwolves star Karl-Anthony Towns were among those in attendance. Jackson is 42. He played for eight NBA teams from 2000-2013 and won a championship in 2003 with the San Antonio Spurs. He and Floyd called each other “twin” because of their resemblance. Both were star high school athletes in the Houston area in the 1990s. Floyd had moved to Minneapolis two years ago for a fresh start. ___ 4 p.m. A white Minneapolis police officer who is charged with murder for kneeling on George Floyd’s neck as he pleaded for air is accused of ignoring another officer who was worried that the handcuffed black man should be rolled onto his side. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The criminal complaint also says that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation. It says the medical examiner concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system, and his underlying health issues likely contributed to his death. The complaint says Floyd was struggling with officers who tried to put him in a squad car and at one point he went to the ground face down. The complaint says one officer held Floyd’s back and another held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area. When one officer said he was getting worried and asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said no. In all, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. The complaint says that includes nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. ___ 3:45 p.m. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has declared a nighttime curfew running from 8 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday and again from 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Sunday. His order comes after sometimes violent protests over the death of George Floyd. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck. Frey's order said nobody may venture out in public during those times, except for emergency responders, or people seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violators can be fined up to $1,000 and jailed up to 90 days. ___ 2:20 p.m. U.S. Attorney General William Barr says he’s “confident justice will be served” after the restraint death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody. Barr said in a statement Friday that the videos of George Floyd’s death were “harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing.” The Justice Department and FBI are conducting an investigation to determine whether federal civil rights laws were broken. Barr’s comments come as the white police officer who was seen on video kneeling on Floyd’s neck was arrested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Barr says a decision whether to pursue federal charges “must be, and will be, based on the law and facts” and that the process is “proceeding quickly.” He said federal officials were working with local law enforcement to ensure relevant evidence is collected as quickly as possible. ___ 1:45 p.m. An uncle of a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis said he will be attending peaceful demonstrations, but that violent protests are “absolutely outlandish.” Selwyn Jones’ nephew George Floyd died Monday after a white officer knelt on his neck as Floyd pleaded for air. Floyd’s death has set off days of protests in the Minneapolis area and communities across the U.S. “I think that is absolutely outlandish for them to destroy their own city, their own home, to make a point,” Jones told the Rapid City Journal in South Dakota. “I don’t think the point that they’re trying to make is the point that we’re trying to make.” Jones is planning to attend a walk in memory of Floyd on Saturday in Rapid City. He said people who have reacted with violent protest and looting are “taking advantage of a bad situation to express anger.” ___ 1:30 p.m. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he has spoken with the family of George Floyd and is calling for justice. Biden’s comments came as a Minnesota prosecutor announced charges against a police officer seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman says Derek Chauvin is charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of Floyd. In a brief online appearance Friday, the former vice president blamed systemic racism, which he called “an open wound” on American society, for Floyd’s death. He says it's time for deep and lasting police reform. Biden also took an indirect swipe at President Donald Trump without naming him, saying it was, “No time for incendiary tweets. No time to incite violence.” ___ 1:15 p.m. A Minnesota prosecutor has charged a police officer with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the restraint death of George Floyd. Floyd is the handcuffed black man whose cries of “I can’t breathe” in a widely seen cellphone video set off days of violent protest in Minneapolis and around the country. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Friday that he may yet bring more charges against the officer, Derek Chauvin. The white officer knelt on Floyd’s neck for at least eight minutes in the video. Floyd can be seen gradually becoming motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignored bystanders’ shouts to get off him. Floyd was pronounced dead at a Minneapolis hospital in an incident that began when police responded to a report of a man passing a counterfeit bill in a grocery store on Memorial Day. The charges came after Minneapolis has been rocked by three days of protests, including looting, scores of fires and the burning of a police precinct station on Thursday even after the governor called out the National Guard. ___ 12:45 p.m. Russia’s Foreign Ministry is responding to the death of George Floyd. The ministry says in a lengthy statement that the death underlines frequent violence by police in the United States. Floyd pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on the handcuffed black man's neck. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested Friday. The statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry says, “This incident is far from the first in a series of manifestations of lawlessness and unjustified violence by the ‘law enforcement officers’ in the United States."" The ministry called on the U.S. to “to take real and effective measures to rectify the situation, return to the conscientious fulfillment of international obligations, and bring national legislation in line with the basic UN principles on the use of force and firearms by law enforcement agencies."" ___ 12:25 p.m. Minnesota authorities say the police officer who knelt on George Floyd has been arrested. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Friday that state investigators arrested Derek Chauvin. Chauvin is the white officer who was seen on video kneeling on the neck of Floyd, a handcuffed black man. The arrest comes after three days of protests, which escalated in violence as demonstrators torched a police precinct that had been abandoned by officers. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to this week’s violent protests. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ___ 12:05 p.m. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is acknowledging the “abject failure” of the response to this week’s protests over the death of George Floyd. During a news conference on Friday, Walz said the state would take over the response. He says it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. He also called for swift justice for officers involved in Floyd's death. The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz’s comments came after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. ___ 11:30 a.m. Attorneys for the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor are calling for an independent investigation of the actions leading to Floyd’s death. They also want national reforms in response to the three deaths. Attorney Benjamin Crump said during a news conference Friday that he's asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. He and attorney Lee Merritt said they want murder charges brought against the four Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd's arrest. And they want the Minnesota attorney general to take over the investigation. Crump says the families from Georgia, Kentucky and now Minnesota have all had to dispel narratives from law enforcement that their loved ones “brought this upon themselves.” They cited an initial report in Floyd’s case that said he threatened police and died of a medical condition. Videos show an officer kneeling on the back of Floyd’s neck as the handcuffed black man pleads for air. The attorneys said they'll seek national legislation seeking better training and to lower the burden to charge officers for excessive force. ___ 11 a.m. A now-fired police officer and a black man who died in his custody both worked as security guards at a popular Latin nightclub as recently as the end of last year. But the club's former owner says it’s not clear whether they knew each other. Officer Derek Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as off-duty security for nearly two decades. Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press that George Floyd had worked there only more recently for about a dozen events that featured African American music. Santamaria says she doesn’t believe the two knew each other before their encounter Monday night when the officer was seen on cellphone video kneeling on Floyd's neck. Santamaria says that if the officer had recognized Floyd, “He might have given him a little more mercy.” Santamaria sold the venue within the past two months. She says Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but didn’t like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup. She says a half dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified “overkill.",0.0
1620227374,2020-05-29 11:12:00,Minneapolis Seethes Over George Floyd's Death As Trump Calls Protesters 'THUGS',https://www.wmra.org/post/minneapolis-seethes-over-george-floyds-death-trump-calls-protesters-thugs,en,False,,144825,wmra.org,http://wmra.org/,"Updated at 10:56 p.m. ET Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer involved in George Floyd's death on Monday, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced the charges Friday, shortly after Chauvin was taken into custody by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The announcement comes days after the release of a video that shows Chauvin's knee pressed firmly on the black man's neck for at least seven minutes. That video has inspired outrage nationwide and unrest in Minneapolis and had led to Chauvin's firing as well as that of three other officers seen in the video. Asked why Chauvin wasn't arrested earlier — something demanded by protesters and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — Freeman said his office moved as quickly as possible in its investigation. He added that the three other former officers remain under investigation and that he anticipates charges for them, too. The Department of Justice is also conducting an investigation on ""a separate and parallel track,"" U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Friday in a statement. ""Both state and federal officers are working diligently and collaboratively to ensure that any available evidence relevant to these decisions is obtained as quickly as possible,"" Barr said. Those investigations, coupled with the officers' firings, has so far failed to satisfy the protesters who had gathered for a third night Thursday in Minneapolis. Some of them stormed the 3rd Police Precinct, the closest precinct to the site of Floyd's arrest, setting fire to that building after police withdrew in an attempt to mitigate tensions. Rioters burned and looted other buildings in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The region has seethed since the release of the video depicting Floyd's arrest, which shows Floyd crying for help before falling silent, while bystanders shout that he's dying. The officer did not remove his knee until paramedics showed up to move Floyd's unresponsive body into an ambulance. He was reported dead later Monday night. In an attempt to avoid another night of chaos, officials ordered a nighttime curfew in Minneapolis and St. Paul beginning at 8 p.m. local time Friday and Saturday nights and continuing until 6 a.m., although the curfew was widely ignored. Here is the latest on the situation: Floyd's family: ""We want a first-degree murder charge"" Floyd's family said that prosecutors have made ""a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice,"" in a statement issued shortly after the announcement that Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. But they feel that authorities haven't gone far enough. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested. We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer,"" the family said in a statement shared by their attorney. In Minnesota, a third-degree murder conviction can result in up to 25 years in prison, while murder in the first degree brings a possible life sentence. ""The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw,"" the family added, ""and is spilling out onto streets across America."" Gov. Tim Walz: ""I understand clearly there is no trust"" During a news conference Friday morning, the Minnesota governor acknowledged the pain of those outraged by Floyd's death in police custody — whose name he added to a list of ""unheard"" black men killed by police, including Philando Castile, who was shot in 2016 by police in a suburb of St. Paul. ""The very tools that we need to use to get control to make sure that buildings aren't burned and the rule of law doesn't collapse are those very institutional tools that have led to that grief and pain. I understand clearly there is no trust in many of our communities,"" Walz told reporters. ""But I'm asking you to help us use humane ways to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice, so that those that are expressing rage and anger and demanding justice are heard."" President Trump's tweet about ""THUGS"" flagged for glorifying violence The president, who called Floyd's death ""very sad and tragic"" earlier this week, said early Friday that he had told Minnesota's governor that ""the Military is with him all the way."" He also described the source of the unrest as ""THUGS"" — a word widely criticized for bearing racial overtones. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" he continued in a tweet partially hidden and flagged by Twitter for violating its policy against ""glorifying violence."" Trump did not miss the social network's decision. Not long after the move, the president — who signed an executive order Thursday aimed at limiting the legal protections afforded to social media companies such as Twitter — took aim at the company with a tweet saying it ""will be regulated."" Trump later sought to clarify his initial tweet, saying that shooting simply can occur when looting gets out of hand. ""It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,"" Trump explained in a pair of tweets. ""It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media."" In a tweet of his own, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said he is ""furious"" that Trump ""is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many."" Gov. Walz apologizes for brief arrest of CNN crew On Friday morning, state police arrested a CNN crew while it was reporting about the unrest on live television: ""A black reporter from CNN was arrested while legally covering the protests in Minneapolis,"" the network pointedly noted. ""A white reporter also on the ground was not."" The crew of correspondent Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez was released about an hour later, and Walz repeatedly apologized during his news conference Friday. ""A few minutes after hearing [about the arrest] I was on a call with CNN President Jeff Zucker, who demanded to know what happened. I take full responsibility,"" Walz said Friday. ""There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen. Calls were made immediately. This is a very public apology to that team. It should not happen."" The swift backtrack did little to soften the shock of the spectacle, though. ""With all the perversions of American democracy that we have witnessed, few rival the dystopian spectacle of a U.S. journalist calmly reporting the news and repeatedly offering to reposition his crew at the police's request, only to be arrested, cuffed and hauled away alongside his crew,"" said Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America, advocacy group that fights for press freedom. She added: ""For us at PEN America, where we routinely document the arrest and imprisonment of writers and journalists worldwide, the action was eerily familiar, but something we expect to see in authoritarian states: Turkey, Hong Kong, Egypt. To see it in the United States of America is appalling."" Obama and others nationwide respond to Floyd's death Demonstrators in Minneapolis are not alone in their outrage over Floyd's death. Activists spilled onto city streets across the country, holding protests seeking justice for the Minneapolis man as well as other unarmed black men and women who have died at the hands of law enforcement officers or in police custody. Large protests were held outside the White House and outside the CNN headquarters in Atlanta, as well as in cities including New York, Houston and San Jose, Calif. Among those who took to social media to express their pain and frustration Friday was former President Barack Obama. ""It's natural to wish for life 'to just get back to normal' as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly 'normal' – whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park,"" Obama said in a statement posted to social media. In speaking of jogging and bird-watching, the former president referred to two other videos that have inspired outrage this month — one in which a black man was followed and killed by two white men while out for a run in Georgia, and another in which a white woman called police on a black bird-watcher in New York City after he asked her to leash her dog. ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" Obama said. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" My statement on the death of George Floyd: pic.twitter.com/Hg1k9JHT6R — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 29, 2020 Protesters have turned out to express their outrage as far as Los Angeles and New York City. Meanwhile in Louisville, Ky., demonstrators gathered Thursday to protest death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot by police during a no-knock raid on her home in March. Those protests turned violent, as well, with several people reported shot amid the melee. As one protester in Minneapolis told NPR, the anger over Floyd's death is about more than just one man — it's about how police treat black people across the U.S. ""This is how our people react, you know? When we've been done wrong for so long,"" he said. ""So, me, I'm just praying and hoping everybody makes it home safe."" NPR's Adrian Florido contributed to this report. ",0.0
1620300136,2020-05-29 13:46:11,Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin arrested in George Floyd's death: Updates,http://rssfeeds.newsleader.com/~/625487452/0/staunton-home~Former-Minneapolis-police-officer-Derek-Chauvin-arrested-in-George-Floyds-death-Updates/,en,False,,81742,newsleader.com,http://www.newsleader.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS – Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was arrested Friday, days after video circulated of him holding his knee to George Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes before Floyd died. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said state investigators arrested Derek Chauvin. The arrest comes after three days of protests, which escalated in violence as demonstrators torched a police precinct that had been abandoned by officers. In a news release on Friday, Attorney Mike Freeman stated that Chauvin has been arrested on charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter.

Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to this week’s violent protests and called for swift justice for police involved in the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district “on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do.

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez) His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said. “You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. Minnesota police arrest CNN reporter and camera crew as they report from protests in Minneapolis https://t.co/oZdqBti776 pic.twitter.com/3QbeTjD5ed — CNN (@CNN) May 29, 2020 The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Minutes after the precinct burned, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” In a follow-up tweet, he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk” and said he was “not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd’s death.

I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs.

CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Minutes after the precinct burned, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” In a follow-up tweet, he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk” and said he was “not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd’s death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest.",0.0

Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin is charged with third degree murder, but they are continuing to review evidence and there may be subsequent charges later. The manslaughter charge is second degree. Freeman said they focused on the ""most dangerous"" perpetrator first, but the other three officers involved in Floyd's arrest are under investigation and he anticipates charges against them as well. The criminal complaint states that Chauvin was the officer seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck while Floyd was pleading, ""I can't breathe."" ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer,"" Freeman said, referring to the video as ""horrible, horrific, terrible."" He said that in addition to that bystander video, they have officers' body-worn cameras, witness statements, the preliminary Medical Examiner's report, and expert opinions as evidence. ""Normally these cases take nine months to a year,"" Freeman said. ""We have to charge these cases very carefully because we have the difficult burden of proof."" When asked whether public unrest factored into the speed, Freeman said, ""I’m not insensitive to what’s happened in the streets."" But he maintained that his job is to charge when his office has ""sufficient evidence."" ""I will not allow us to charge a case before it is ready,"" Freeman said. ""This case is now ready, and we have charged it."" Freeman said that the charges are the same ones levied against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond. According to the criminal complaint in the Floyd case, two officers responded to a report of someone using a counterfeit $20 bill at the Cup Foods on 37th and Chicago Avenue. Officers Thomas Lane and J.A. Kueng were told the man was sitting in a car parked around the corner, on 38th Street. The complaint says Lane began speaking with Floyd, who was in the driver's seat of the car, and then pulled his gun and told Floyd to show his hands. When Floyd put his hands on the steering wheel, Lane put his gun back. According to the complaint, Lane ordered Floyd out of the car, then pulled him out and handcuffed him. Floyd ""actively resisted being handcuffed,"" but then became compliant and sat on the sidewalk at Lane's direction. The attorney's office says in the complaint that Floyd and Lang had a conversation for just under two minutes, and then both officers stood Floyd up and tried to walk him to their squad. At that point, the charges state that Floyd ""stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic."" That's when officers Derek Chauvin and Tou Thoa arrived as backup. They made ""several attempts"" to get Floyd into the backseat of the car and ""Floyd did not voluntarily get in the car and struggled with the officers by intentionally falling down, saying he was not going int the car, and refusing to stand still,"" the complaint says. According to the complaint, Floyd said he could not breathe while he was standing up, and began repeating it. The complaint says officers tried to get Floyd into the car from the passenger side, and and at 8:19 p.m. Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the car. ""Mr. Floyd went to the ground face down and still handcuffed,"" the complaint narrative then reads. ""Kueng held Mr. Floyd’s back and Lane held his legs. The defendant placed his left knee in the area of Mr. Floyd’s head and neck. Mr. Floyd said, 'I can’t breathe' multiple times and repeatedly said, 'Mama' and 'please,' as well. The defendant and the other two officers stayed in their positions."" According to the complaint, the officers told Floyd, ""you are talking fine."" Lane asked if they should roll him on his side, and Chauvin said, ""No, staying put where we got him."" The complaint says that Lane asked again, ""I am worried about excited delirium or whatever,"" and Chauvin said, ""That's why we have him on his stomach."" ""None of the three officers moved from their positions,"" the complaint says. The body-worn camera footage investigators examined showed that Floyd stopped moving at 8:24:24, and stopped breathing or speaking at 8:25:31. Kueng checked Floyd's wrist for a pulse and said ""I couldn't find one,"" but none of the officers moved until 8:27:24, when Chauvin removed his knee from Floyd's neck, according to the complaint. The autopsy report is pending but preliminary findings show that Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. ""The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death,"" the report says, with no evidence of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation. Prosecutors ended the criminal complaint by saying, ""The defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive. Police are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" In a letter to Gov. Walz Friday afternoon, the Minneapolis Delegation requested that the case be handled by the Attorney General's Office rather than the Hennepin County Attorney. The letter, which was written in collaboration by Representatives Fue Lee (59A), Raymond Dehn (59B), Sydney Jordan (60A), Mohamud Noor (60B), Frank Hornstein (61A), Jamie Long (61B), Hodan Hassan (62A), Aisha Gomez (62B), Jim Davnie (63A), Jean Wagenius (63B), reads: We are writing to request that the case against the police officers who killed George Floyd, or may have been otherwise culpable in his death, be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Attorney General's office. Unfortunately, our constituents, especially constituents of color, have lost faith in the ability of Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to fairly and impartially investigate and prosecute these cases. Freeman's press conference on May 28th, in which he seemed ill-prepared and suggested that there was unseen exculpatory evidence that might exonerate the officers, further ruptured this trust. Given the present circumstances, we believe that this case should be handled in a way that maximizes public trust and gives confidence to the public that justice will be done. Under the circumstances, transferring the case to the Attorney General's office would be one of the most decisive actions that you could take to calm public anger and guarantee a fair process. Attorney General Ellison has earned goodwill of Minneapolis residents through years of service to the city, and is known and respected throughout the community. It is imperative to signal to our constituents, as strongly and quickly as possible, that the authorities are treating this case with the special attention it deserves, and to demonstrate that all Minnesotans are equal in the eyes of the law. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey issued a statement in response to the charges Friday, saying, ""We are a nation at a crossroad, and today’s decision from the County Attorney is an essential first step on a longer road toward justice and healing our city."" “What’s happened in Minneapolis is bigger than any one city and any single event,” said Frey. “For our Black community who have, for centuries, been forced to endure injustice in a world simply unwilling to correct or acknowledge it: I know that whatever hope you feel today is tempered with skepticism and a righteous outrage."" Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington announced earlier Friday during a different news conference that Chauvin had been arrested. The BCA confirms that he was taken into custody at 11:44 a.m. Friday in Minneapolis. Meanwhile, Governor Tim Walz held a news conference at 10:30 a.m. after another night of violence and looting in Minneapolis and St. Paul, as protests over the death of George Floyd devolved into riots. Walz said he received a call from State Sen. Patricia Torres Ray Thursday that District 63 was burning, and there were no police officers or Minnesota National Guard troops to help. “That is an abject failure that cannot happen,"" Walz said. ""We must restore that order.” Harrington said that national guard troops were called in to help Thursday, but they did not receive a “specific mission” to help clear the streets until midnight, on a call with the mayor. Harrington said Minneapolis Mayor Frey informed them they had ""no more resources"" and they were not able to meet public safety needs on Lake Street. ""When the Third Precinct was abandoned, it seemed that that was the time to move,"" Gov. Walz said. They then had to get a plan together, Harrington said. By the time they brought state patrol, Minnesota National Guard, and other assisting crews to Lake Street, he said it was 3 a.m. They arrested some people at that time and for other looting incidents throughout the day, Harrington said, but he did not have numbers on how many. He said most people left peacefully. Harrington said the people who were out at that hour were not the people of Minneapolis “who are still having their guts ripped out about the Floyd murder.” “I don’t want to prejudice this,” he said regarding using the term “murder.” “I’m just calling it like I see it.” “I can tell you that no one could have heard Mr. Floyd’s voice in the chaos of the screaming and the shouting and the fires at 1 o’clock in the morning on Lake Street,” he said. “My job is to make sure the community is safe and the team is ready and prepared to keep it safe.” Harrington said his team, including the national guard, state troopers and DNR, is confident that they can make a plan to keep people safe Friday night while protecting First Amendment rights to protest. “We will create a plan that will keep the peace, maintain the peace, and prevent further lawless behavior in the city of Minneapolis, the city of St. Paul and surrounding suburbs,” he said. The governor acknowledged that the ""tools"" needed to restore order, including the Minnesota National Guard, are ""the very same tools that have led to that grief and pain."" Those national guard troops are armed, officials confirmed Friday, and maintain the right to defend themselves, though they would not comment further on the boundaries around their use of force. ""I’m asking you to help us. Help us use a humane way to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice,"" he said. ""So those who are demanding justice can be heard. Not those who throw fire bombs into businesses."" Walz said that he has spoken with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman and he is confident that ""justice will be swift, that it will come in a timely manner, and that it will be fair."" ""You're seeing holes in planning,"" Walz said, ""that's for dang sure."" He said Minnesotans can expect to hear what the plan is for Friday night by 2 p.m. ""Tonight needs to be different,"" Walz said. He promised that state troops would step into the gap. State Attorney General Keith Ellison quoted Martin Luther King, Jr., when he asked Minnesotans not to disregard riots as only senseless violence. ""Ask yourself, what’s going on there?"" he said. ""And is it something that we as a society absolutely must pay attention to? I think we must pay attention."" Ellison pointed out that as Minnesota National Guard troops are deployed to maintain order, they are the same people who were administering COVID-19 tests across the state last week. ""Don’t react to them the way you might react to the Minneapolis Police Department,"" he said. ""It’s not the same group. They have different leadership, different authority, and their job is to try to bring peace and calm back again. Please remember that this is not the group you associate with unfair conduct."" Walz said Friday that he believes the public has ""lost faith"" in the Minneapolis Police Department. The state's response came as businesses and homes continued to burn Thursday night and Friday morning. Just after 10:30 p.m., a crowd stormed the building housing the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct, setting it on fire. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey held a press conference just after 1 a.m. to address the continued unrest across the city. Frey said rioting posed an imminent threat to the safety of the officers and staffers within MPD's Third Precinct, forcing him to make the decision to evacuate the compound. “Symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life or the public,” Frey said. “We could not risk serious injury to anyone… brick and mortar is not as important as life.” However, he went on to say that progress during this crisis would not come from the government alone. “We additionally need help from the community. We need to make sure that people are looking out for our city right now. It's not just enough to do the right thing for yourself. We need to make sure that all of us are upholding the ideals that we stand by.” Although the mayor acknowledged the pain and frustration in recent days, he made it clear, the devastation is unacceptable. “What we have seen over the past couple of nights in terms of looting is unacceptable. These are businesses. These are community institutions that we need. These are banks that people rely on to get cash, grocery stores that people rely on to get food … We need to ensure that they are protected.” In St. Paul, fires burned in buildings across the street from Allianz Field. According to a post from the Saint Paul Police Department, more than 170 businesses have been damaged or looted along with dozens of fires. President Trump also weighed in on Twitter late Thursday night, blaming the emergent social disturbance on a lack of local leadership, and threatened to send in the federal National Guard unless the city was brought under control. The president went on to tweet, ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"" Twitter has since removed a portion of the president's tweet, citing violations of their user policy for glorifying violence.",0.0

Taken at 11:59 p.m. and transmitted a few moments later, it swiftly produced powerful reactions — perhaps the most indelible image yet of the racial divisions and violent protests flaring after the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck.

Multiple commentators on social media depicted it as “Picture of the Year.” Cortez had sensed an opportunity as soon as he saw the flag-bearer approach – photojournalists know that flags have distinctive symbolic power, as evidenced by the famous photograph of flag-raising Marines at Iwo Jima. “I didn’t think of it as a contest winner,” Cortez said of his photo. “I thought it told a story.” Cortez, based in Baltimore for the AP, had arrived in the Twin Cities on Thursday afternoon, along with New York-based AP photographer John Minchillo. They spent about three hours covering unrest in St. Paul, then shifted to Minneapolis after hearing there was a new outbreak of trouble at a police precinct house there. “We’d been working that scene for about two hours when this particular moment happened,” Cortez said. “The police abandoned the precinct — there was just chaos and fires and people throwing stuff.” Minchillo then relocated, having been asked to provide some video footage. Cortez stayed near the precinct house, though growing uneasy as word spread that a gas line had been severed and might explode. “When I saw the man walking up with the flag, I started getting closer,” he said. “I could tell this was going to be very visual, so I just followed along. I wanted to silhouette him, so I waited for him to walk where it was burning.” David Ake, AP’s director of photography, said Cortez’ photo was powerful on many levels. “The upside-down flag is the universal signal of distress and is framed perfectly and backlit by the flames in the background adding to the urgency of the distress,” he said “One foot in either direction and the image would lose that backlight and lose the impact.” Ake also noted that the person holding the flag is unrecognizable. “It could be any person of any age, race, or gender,” he said. “It could be you or me.” Cortez has been with the AP nearly 10 years, including a previous posting in New Jersey.

Floyd's death has sparked days of protests in Minneapolis. President Trump blamed the unrest on ""thugs"" in a tweet that was later hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" Read Obama's full statement below, including a reference to a viral video of a song by Keedron Bryant, who pleads, ""I just want to live, God protect me."" I want to share parts of the conversations I've had with friends over the past couple days about the footage of George Floyd dying face down on the street under the knee of a police officer in Minnesota. The first is an email from a middle-aged African American businessman. ""Dude I gotta tell you the George Floyd incident in Minnesota hurt. I cried when I saw that video. It broke me down. The 'knee on the neck' is a metaphor for how the system so cavalierly holds black folks down, ignoring the cries for help. People don't care. Truly tragic."" Another friend of mine used the powerful song that went viral from 12-year-old Keedron Bryant to describe the frustrations he was feeling. The circumstances of my friend and Keedron may be different, but their anguish is the same. It's shared by me and millions of others. It's natural to wish for life ""to just get back to normal"" as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly ""normal"" — whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park. This shouldn't be ""normal"" in 2020 America. It can't be ""normal."" If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better. It will fall mainly on the officials of Minnesota to ensure that the circumstances surrounding George Floyd's death are investigated thoroughly and that justice is ultimately done. But it falls on all of us, regardless of our race or station — including the majority of men and women in law enforcement who take pride in doing their tough job the right way, every day — to work together to create a ""new normal"" in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.

1620523741,2020-05-29 18:41:02,Trump's tweet about rioters echoes 1960s Miami police chief,https://www.wsls.com/news/politics/2020/05/29/trumps-tweet-about-rioters-echoes-1960s-miami-police-chief/,en,False,,90694,wsls.com,http://www.wsls.com/#spider,"CHICAGO – President Donald Trump's tweeted warning Friday amid unrest in Minneapolis that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” echoes the language of a Miami police chief in 1967 who made clear his distaste for civil rights activists and his belief that violent protests should be met with deadly force. The language has also been attributed to segregationist presidential candidate George Wallace in a 1968 campaign speech in Pittsburgh. Trump said he was unaware of the origins of the language. About 13 hours after his provocative tweet, he took to Twitter again to claim that he wasn’t suggesting the shooting of rioters. Instead, he said he was referring to gun violence that has been spurred by the unrest. The phrase first made headlines when Miami Police Chief Walter Headley uttered it in a 1967 speech outlining his department’s efforts to “combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.” “We don’t mind being accused of police brutality,” he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. Trump, in his follow-up tweets, appeared to be referring to the deadly shooting of a man outside a Minneapolis pawn shop on the second night of protests there and to the wounding of people in Louisville, Kentucky, when gunfire broke out at a Thursday protest stemming from the March police shooting death of a 26-year-old black woman. “Looting leads to shooting, and that’s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot,” Trump tweeted. “I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means.” Speaking to reporters at the White House later on Friday, Trump said, “I don’t know where it came from or where it originated. “But I’ve heard it for a long time, as most people have,” Trump added. ""And frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die.” Headley, who spent 20 years leading the Miami department, sought to send an unambiguous message to protesters that he had little tolerance for any actions that he deemed over the line. During the 1968 race riots in the Liberty City section of Miami that stemmed from anger in the black community over substandard housing and bleak economic conditions, Headley's language was even more harsh as he reprised the looting-shooting phrase. Police killed three residents during that riot. “There is only one way to handle looters and arsonists during a riot and that is to shoot them on sight,” Headley said. “I’ve let the word filter down: When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and frequent critic of Trump's, said that phrase has reverberated in the South and was “always used about civil rights protesters.” Sharpton said Trump’s “race-tinged” comments reminded him of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley calling on police “to shoot to kill” arsonists and “maim or cripple” looters in the April 1968 riots in the city following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. “I don’t know if the history of it was in his head or someone around him said it and he liked the sound of it,” Sharpton said. “But it’s certainly in his spirit, and it poisons an already volatile situation."" Wallace, who pushed pro-segregationist policies as governor of Alabama, used the same phrase as he campaigned in Pennsylvania in 1968, according to a 2005 column by a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writer who was at the event. ___ Shafner reported from New York.",0.0
1620523736,2020-05-29 18:42:43,Biden ally sees Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate,https://www.wsls.com/news/politics/2020/05/29/biden-ally-sees-klobuchar-as-less-likely-biden-running-mate/,en,False,,90694,wsls.com,http://www.wsls.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON – Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters on Friday that while he believes Klobuchar is “absolutely” qualified to be vice president, “This is very tough timing for her.” Klobuchar was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. During that period, more than two dozen people — mostly minorities — died during encounters with police. Following customary practice at the time, she sent the cases to grand juries, which brought no criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Clyburn, who called his view a “gut feeling,” played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the Democratic Party’s all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress’ highest-ranking black lawmaker. “So often in politics, timing really dictates things. Barack Obama I don’t think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. “And I don’t know whether he could get elected today.” Clyburn helped revive Biden’s badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive win in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party’s presumptive nominee. On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd have “nothing to do with my running mate.” Pressed on whether Floyd’s killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. “And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Klobuchar did not respond to a request Friday by The Associated Press for an interview. On CNN, she sidestepped a question about her vice presidential prospects. “He’s going to make the best decision on whoever he wants to govern with,” she said of Biden. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, spent eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breathe as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. Chauvin's 2006 case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar was elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney’s office. Mike Freeman, Klobuchar's successor as prosecutor, made “all prosecutorial decisions"" about Chauvin, according to a Freeman statement that Klobuchar's office provided Saturday. Klobuchar told MSNBC that she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate “patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing” by the Minneapolis police. ___ AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

'The cop who killed George Floyd,' Facebook and Twitter users claimed, wrongly identifying a man pictured laughing alongside President Donald Trump at a rally as former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin. More fake videos and photos followed as the demonstrations turned violent the next day. Some speculated, without evidence, that Floyd's death was staged or that protesters had been paid to stir up trouble, in tweets collectively shared thousands of times. Others said a video showed a protester driving a car through a shopping complex in Minneapolis, when in fact the footage was taken during an incident at an Illinois mall last year. Since a video of an officer kneeling on Floyd's neck first surfaced, internet troublemakers and even celebrities have posted misleading or unsubstantiated claims around his death and the ensuing protests. The social media inaccuracies have created confusion around the unfolding news, tearing at the already loosely woven seams of America's racial tapestry. 'A good deal of this, if not all of this, is intentionally trying to stoke the racial flame that has been ablaze in the United States almost since slavery started 400-plus years ago,' said Lanier Holt, a communications professor at Ohio State University who studied in Minneapolis. While the falsehoods may have been unwittingly amplified by some, they have likely been planted by those preying on existing racial tensions, Holt said. 'They put out that false information to get that narrative in the minds of people who already have these ... pre-existing biases,' he said. The online misinformation so far appears to have fallen along those racial divides. The day after Floyd died, Twitter and Facebook users shared a photo of a man wearing a 'Make America White Again' red cap, claiming it was Chauvin, who was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. A version of the image was actually first posted online by a pro-Trump internet trickster who has previously duped media outlets into writing fictitious stories. Jonathan Riches confirmed to The Associated Press through messages that he was the man in the photo. Twitter later labeled rapper and actor Ice Cube's tweet with the photo as 'manipulated media.' After protests on Thursday night, the St. Paul Police Department denied rumors trending online that one of its police officers was responsible for breaking windows of an AutoZone store in neighboring Minneapolis. 'We know with precision where that officer has been and who that officer has been with,' St. Paul Police spokesman Steve Linders said. 'He was at work, and not at the location.' Meanwhile, others have posted old or out-of-context photos online and falsely suggested it showed the damage caused by Minnesota protesters. Hundreds of thousands viewed a short video clip circulating online that purported to show a car driving through the Mall of America, the massive shopping complex that sits in a Minneapolis suburb. 'RIP to Mall of America,' one Twitter user wrote. Fact checkers debunked the video, but as of Friday afternoon, people on Facebook and Twitter continued to say that the mall had been looted by protesters. Facebook declined to comment Friday on misinformation on their platform around Floyd's death or the protests. Divisive misinformation around Floyd's death and the resulting protests thrives online because social media users choose who they do "" or don't "" follow and are less likely to be exposed to differing viewpoints outside of their circle of pages, family and friends. 'We thought social media was going to be this great equalizer,' Holt said. 'People find networks of people who are just like them. If they don't actually have literal black friends, this reinforces all the stereotypes that were fed to them.' ___ Associated Press writers David Klepper in Rhode Island, Ali Swenson in Phoenix and Beatrice Dupuy in New York contributed to this story.",0.0

According to the indictment, 39-year-old Joseph Cherry II allegedly fraudulently obtain disaster-related loan benefits in the form of Small Business Administration sponsored Economic Injury Disaster loans and a Paycheck Protection Program loan. The loans resulted in the disbursement of over $190,000 in proceeds from March 2020 to May 2020. These SBA programs under the CARES Act are designed to provide support for small businesses in the community impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our communities in innumerable ways,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “The CARES Act provides emergency relief to help mitigate some of those effects.” “Fraud targeting CARES Act benefits unjustly diverts these resources away from the people and businesses who most need them. EDVA remains steadfastly committed to prosecuting those who seek to exploit this crisis for their own personal gain,” Terwilliger continued. According to the indictment, Cherry allegedly obtained these loans under false pretenses related to fabricating his income, job status, businesses, and prior criminal record. Additionally, in April, Cherry obtained the proceeds of over $190,000, and of that, about $140,000 was exchanged into cash or a cashier’s check within a few days. “Providing false statements to gain access to SBA’s programs will be aggressively investigated by our office,” said Hannibal “Mike” Ware, Inspector General of the U.S. Small Business Administration. “SBA OIG and its law enforcement partners are poised to root out fraud in SBA’s programs and bring wrongdoers to justice. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice,” he said. The Norfolk Police Department Special Operations Team assisted the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force with the arrest. “The immediacy with which the Deputy Marshals responded in making this arrest should send a clear message to those intending to misuse the financial resources our government is providing to those trying to recover from the ongoing pandemic,” said Nick E. Proffitt, U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Virginia. “The public should take comfort in knowing that even in this difficult COVID-19 environment, Deputy United States Marshals are at work each and every day to help ensure the community is safe, and justice is served.” A statement released by the Department of Justice stated that “Cherry is charged in a 10-count indictment with charges of wire fraud, theft of government property, false statements to the small business administration, and money laundering. If convicted, he faces statutory maximums ranging from 10 to 30 years in prison on each count.” Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

1620562194,2020-05-29 20:28:18,Live updates: George Floyd protests grow in cities across the U.S.,https://www.wfxrtv.com/news/live-updates-george-floyd-protests-grow-in-cities-across-the-u-s/,en,False,,576666,virginiafirst.com,http://virginiafirst.com/,"ATLANTA (AP) — Demonstrators marched, stopped traffic and in some cases lashed out violently at police as protests erupted Friday in dozens of U.S. cities following the killing of George Floyd after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted ”“No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “Quit your jobs.” At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said in an emailed statement. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Demonstrators ignored police demands to disperse. Some protesters moved to the city’s major interstate thoroughfare to try to block traffic. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.” “You are disgracing our city,” she told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.” Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King’s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. “We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. In Minneapolis, a curfew did little to stop protesters and others from gathering in several areas of the city, including the battered Lake Street neighborhood where a police precinct was burned the night before. There were scattered small fires and some stores in a strip mall were being broken into near the city’s 5th Precinct. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to take away prisoners. “We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. “Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd. Jimmy Ohaz, 19, came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” See updates from earlier in the evening below (all times ET).

It said it routinely conducts such operations if needed to help other agencies or during natural disasters. The drone returned to its base in Grand Forks, North Dakota, after “the requesting agency determined that the aircraft was no longer needed for operational awareness.” CBP did not identify the agency that requested the assistance. 7:52 p.m. CNN Center in Atlanta Police cars getting literally destroyed in Atlanta outside the CNN Center pic.twitter.com/x5zRxZVQpb — Fernando Alfonso III (@fernalfonso) May 29, 2020 SWAT pushing in in ATL, CNN Center vandalized and has had windows smashed pic.twitter.com/EgMrEaYCTB — intelwave ⚓️ (@inteldotwav) May 29, 2020 Atlanta protesters burn American flag in front of CNN Center #GeorgeFloyddeath pic.twitter.com/89FLqW0GYt — ivan (@ivan8848) May 29, 2020 7:41 p.m. New York City protesters reach CNN The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0

(WAVY) — Hundreds of people descended on Downtown Norfolk and Fort Monroe in Hampton Friday evening in protest of the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a Minneapolis Police officer earlier this week. Black Lives Matter 757 organized two gatherings in Hampton Roads Friday called “blackout757.” Both began at 7:57 p.m. One was at Fort Monroe in Hampton near the pavilion, and another was in Martin Luther King Jr. Monument Park and the surrounding area in Norfolk. The protests eventually moved to Interstate 64 around 9 p.m., when protesters shut down the lanes near Mallory Street in Hampton. The group went live on Facebook showing the Hampton location filled with people, many holding up their phones and signs. ABOVE: WAVY viewer video shows protesters in Downtown Norfolk. The signs read “Black Lives Matter and” “No justice, no peace, no police brutality.” A livestream on the Black Lives Matter 757 Facebook page showed protesters walking eastbound near the HRBT down the entrance ramp off Mallory Street. A tweet from 511 Hampton Roads around 9 p.m. said all eastbound lanes on Interstate 64 were blocked. Police confirmed an “incident” going eastbound shut down the tunnel. Both directions of traffic were released by 10:10 p.m. Protesters could be seen on the livestream shutting down the westbound lanes of the interstate as well. The protesters shut down the interstate for nearly nine minutes starting around 9 p.m. to represent how long Floyd went without air. During those nine minutes, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter” and “I can’t breathe” while standing among the stopped cars on I-64 near the Mallory Street exit. “I can’t breathe” were some of Floyd’s last words, which were captured on a widely-circulated video on the internet. After stopping traffic, protesters gathered on Mallory Street and chanted “No peace, no sleep” followed by a moment of silence remembering those who died at the hands of police, from suicide or from gun violence. After shutting down the interstate, protesters went to Peninsula Town Center to continue the protest. By 11:20 p.m., Hampton Police were playing a message on a loudspeaker around the intersection of Power Plant Way and Mercury Boulevard saying the gathering had been determined to be unlawful. Police asked the group to disperse. The road was also blocked to traffic. Some officers could be seen with shields and helmets. The crowd began to disperse around 12:30 a.m. Watch WAVY News Reporter Geena Arevalo as she reported live from the protest scene in Hampton Friday night.

1620598866,2020-05-29 21:57:07,Live updates: George Floyd protests grow across the U.S.,https://www.wavy.com/news/national/live-updates-george-floyd-protests-grow-in-cities-across-the-u-s/,en,False,,70270,wavy.com,http://www.wavy.com/#spider,"ATLANTA (AP) — Demonstrators marched, stopped traffic and in some cases lashed out violently at police as protests erupted Friday in dozens of U.S. cities following the killing of George Floyd after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted ”“No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “Quit your jobs.” At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said in an emailed statement. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Demonstrators ignored police demands to disperse. Some protesters moved to the city’s major interstate thoroughfare to try to block traffic. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.” “You are disgracing our city,” she told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.” Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King’s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. “We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. In Minneapolis, a curfew did little to stop protesters and others from gathering in several areas of the city, including the battered Lake Street neighborhood where a police precinct was burned the night before. There were scattered small fires and some stores in a strip mall were being broken into near the city’s 5th Precinct. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to take away prisoners. “We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. “Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd. Jimmy Ohaz, 19, came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” See updates from earlier in the evening below (all times ET).

1620609313,2020-05-29 21:48:17,Stafford mom on the run speaks out about why she disappeared with her kids,https://www.wfxrtv.com/news/commonwealth-news/stafford-mom-on-the-run-speaks-out-about-why-she-disappeared-with-her-kids/,en,False,,576666,virginiafirst.com,http://virginiafirst.com/,"RICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) — Melody Bannister, the 34-year-old Stafford County mother who led U.S. Marshals on a nationwide manhunt and was captured in Indiana, has been extradited back to Virginia. For the first time, she’s speaking out to our sister-station WRIC about why she disappeared with her children. She says she ran because her kids were being abused. Bannister was extradited back to Stafford County to face charges with abducting her children, violating a court order and filing a false police report. According to her lawyer, she remains in custody at Rappahannock Regional Jail. The Stafford mom had been on the run with her kids for eight months. U.S. Marshals caught up with her at a gas station in Indiana with her four children. They were found safe in the car. Talking from the Hendricks County Jail in Indiana, Bannister said she reported to the Stafford County, Virginia Sheriff’s Office that her children were allegedly being sexually abused by a family member and his friends as part of a sex trafficking ring. “They were being beaten and raped. They were forced to perform oral sex on groups of men,” Bannister said. Bannister said she told the Stafford detective on the case she would be heading out of town on a planned family vacation after filing her report. “I knew that there was a chance that my children would be in danger as soon as we went to the police,” explained Bannister. The Stafford County Sheriff’s Office confirmed to WRIC the allegations were investigated by them and child protective services but they were determined to be unfounded. Then when a judge ordered custody of the children to her husband, that’s when the Stafford mom took off across the country with the children in tow. Bannister said, “The highest priority was always, always to keep the kids safe. I could not return to Virginia because it was not safe.” While on the run, Bannister blogged about the alleged abuse and journey. She claimed they were well cared for, fed and housed by a network of supporters. “You know, the concept of the underground railroad is not lost,” Bannister said. A Change.Org petition to help Bannister has more than 46,000 signatures. While in Alabama for a bit, Bannister secured attorney Samuel McLure. “I think any mother that gave a salt about her kids and would have done the exact same thing,” McLure said. McLure had Bannister and her children evaluated by nationally known forensic psychiatrist Dr. Carole Lieberman. She concluded three of the children had been abused physically, sexually and emotionally. “Unlike Child Protective Services in Stafford County, who did a 15-minute interview, Dr. Lieberman spent over eight hours with these children,” McLure said. Hope for Justice, a global anti-human trafficking non-profit has also joined the case. An investigator with the group believes he found evidence supporting Bannister’s claims, as well as writings and artwork from the kids revealing the alleged abuse. Yet, others say Bannister is a false victim, the writings and artwork produced while on the run. They claim she’s unstable, brainwashed the kids and that this was nothing more than an interstate custody battle in a sophisticated plot to leave her husband. Bannister denies that. She says, “This was 100 percent, I need to get my kids safe.” In the meantime, Bannister with the help of her attorney has filed a civil complaint in Alabama alleging human trafficking against several Virginia residents. “I think the truth will come out in time,” said McLure. 8News spoke to Bannister’s husband and he said he couldn’t say much with the ongoing case and that it was not in the best interest of his kids. He did tell WRIC the children are with him and are doing fantastic.

He says the tweets, “exploit black people and black pain,” for political purposes. He says the imagery in the tweets relates directly to events like the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “Point blank, they were designed to perpetuate the idea that blacks are sub-human. This is tied to individuals getting killed on the street. This is tied to individuals getting pulled out of their cars, getting shot in their cars. This is all tied to that.

Georgia’s governor declared a state of emergency in one county to activate up to 500 members of the state National Guard “to protect people & property in Atlanta.” Gov. Brian Kemp said in a pair of tweets early Saturday that the move came at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and in consultation with emergency officials. The Georgia National Guard will deploy “immediately” to assist law enforcement, he said. In Minneapolis, where a police precinct was burned the night before, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring an 8 p.m. curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. As a pair of restaurants and a Wells Fargo branch were set ablaze, a heavy contingent of National Guard, state troopers and police moved in, some on foot and some in vehicles. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted ”“No justice, no peace” and “Say his name.

We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. Protesters gathered outside the White House, with President Donald Trump inside, and some tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue.

About 1,000 protesters gathered in Oakland. They smashed windows, sprayed buildings with ""Kill Cops” graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police. Oakland Police were notifying a crowd that the demonstrationwas an unlawful assembly. Authorities said officers were injured when projectiles were thrown and that they were asking people to leave the area. Demonstrators in Los Angeles scuffled at times with police, with a few protesters detained and one officer receiving medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and CNN reported that someone wrote “killer” on a patrol car. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was being treated at a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, he and police officials said. Liccardo said his own officers shared the community's outrage over Floyd's in-custody death. “It was a horrible injustice. I’d venture to guess that every police officer out there feels much of the same anger about what happened in Minneapolis,” he told The Associated Press. Thirty miles to the west, Santa Cruz police chief Andrew G. Mills said in a statement that the actions by Minneapolis officers in Floyd's death “are the antithesis of what we view as good policing.”",0.0

(WRIC) — Hundreds of people gathered in downtown Richmond Friday evening in protest of the death of George Floyd. The protest, which began around 8:30 p.m., was in response to the events that led to Floyd’s death, who is seen on video being pinned down by three Minneapolis officers while in police custody. One officer, Derek Chauvin, is seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he continuously yells in distress. Following the nationwide outrage, Chauvin was fired and has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. In Richmond, protesters lined Broad Street and Franklin Street before making their way towards the area of the Governor’s Mansion. 8News reporter Sierra Fox was live near the Virginia State Capitol as protesters shouted the name “George Floyd” in unison. Signs of “I Can’t Breathe,” words uttered by Floyd, were also visible. Some protesters yelled profanity and shouted at responding police officers.

1620621648,2020-05-29 19:39:59,Biden ally sees Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate,https://www.progress-index.com/ZZ/news/20200529/biden-ally-sees-klobuchar-as-less-likely-biden-running-mate?rssfeed=true,en,True,,147801,progress-index.com,http://progress-index.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters on Friday that while he believes Klobuchar is 'absolutely' qualified to be vice president, 'This is very tough timing for her.' Klobuchar was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. During that period, more than two dozen people "" mostly minorities "" died during encounters with police. Following customary practice at the time, she sent the cases to grand juries, which brought no criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Clyburn, who called his view a 'gut feeling,' played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the Democratic Party's all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress' highest-ranking black lawmaker. 'So often in politics, timing really dictates things. Barack Obama I don't think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. 'And I don't know whether he could get elected today.' Clyburn helped revive Biden's badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive win in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party's presumptive nominee. On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd have 'nothing to do with my running mate.' Pressed on whether Floyd's killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. 'And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Klobuchar did not respond to a request Friday by The Associated Press for an interview. On CNN, she sidestepped a question about her vice presidential prospects. 'He's going to make the best decision on whoever he wants to govern with,' she said of Biden. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, spent eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breathe as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. Chauvin's 2006 case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar was elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney's office. Mike Freeman, Klobuchar's successor as prosecutor, made 'all prosecutorial decisions"" about Chauvin, according to a Freeman statement that Klobuchar's office provided Saturday. Klobuchar told MSNBC that she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate 'patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing' by the Minneapolis police. ___ AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

WAVE 3 News reporter Kaitlin Rust appeared to have been hit by pepper balls, reportedly fired by a police officer, during a Friday night protest in downtown Louisville, Kentucky. (Source: WAVE/Gray News) It was previously reported that the officer was firing rubber bullets, but LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said the department’s officers do not use rubber bullets, and it was likely that was Rust and Dobson were hit with pepper balls. Halladay commented again on the incident during a Saturday morning briefing with Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. “We believe it was one of our SRT officers; we are still trying to identify which officer,” Halladay said. “Targeting the media is not our intention. There was a lot going on last night, and to be fair to both the officer and to Kaitlin, we need to take a deeper look at what happened and what prompted that action. So we have said that we will do that and if there needs to be discipline we will address it.” In response to what happened to Rust and Dobson, WAVE 3 News General Manager Ken Selvaggi issued a statement saying, “We strongly condemn the actions of the LMPD officer who tonight repeatedly fired at and hit our reporter and cameraman, both of whom were courageously and lawfully covering breaking news in their community. There is simply no justification for the Louisville police to wantonly open fire, even with pepper balls, on any journalists under any circumstances.” The statement also said “When the officer fired at Ms. Rust and Mr. Dobson, the two had been following police instructions, were standing behind the police line when they were fired upon, and were not disrupting or otherwise interfering with law enforcement.” During night two of several hundred protesters gathering downtown in wake of protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, crowds appear to be larger and police are continuing their efforts to clear the area. A WAVE vehicle was found vandalized downtown as the crowd intensified. Louisville protesters want action taken against three LMPD officers involved in the death of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor, a black woman, in March. She was shot during a no-knock warrant that was being served at her home. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced Friday morning no-knock warrants would be suspended in the city. “To people who gathered downtown last night to protest,” Fischer said, “and to many more throughout our city and throughout our country who feel angry, hurt, afraid, frustrated, tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law-enforcement, I hear you.” He also spoke of unity and thanked Taylor’s family for speaking out against the Thursday night protests that resulted in seven people being hit by gunfire and vandalism. “This is the challenge of our time that we must rise to,” Fischer said. “So let’s rise to the challenge of this moment and work for the truth, work for peace, work for justice for Breonna Taylor, her family and for all of the people of our city. They deserve it. We deserve it.” Copyright 2020 WAVE via Gray News. All rights reserved.",0.0
1620630215,2020-05-29 22:53:09,Online grocery ordering & delivery for SNAP launches in Virginia; some say it’s overdue,https://www.wavy.com/news/virginia/online-grocery-ordering-delivery-for-snap-launches-in-virginia-some-say-its-overdue/,en,False,,70270,wavy.com,http://www.wavy.com/#spider,"RICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) — For the first time on Friday, the 750,000 Virginians currently on SNAP can buy food online for delivery. The program allows SNAP recipients to order from Amazon and Walmart, though they cannot use their benefits to cover the cost of delivery. Eddie Oliver, the executive director for the Federation of Virginia Food Banks, said the option is long overdue. “It’s really something that should’ve been in place a while ago. Folks in the anti-hunger community have been advocating for this because it’s part of a larger access issue,” Oliver said. “There’s no reason that low-income families shouldn’t be able to get groceries the same way anyone else does.” Oliver said the online purchasing pilot is the latest step in a long evolution for SNAP, following the transition from stigmatized food stamps to a card system. That evolution took on more urgency because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Toni Blue Washington. Blue Washington, the Virginia Department of Social Services Division of Benefits Director, said that the 2014 Farm Bill paved the way for the online purchasing pilot program. Before the pandemic, she said the U.S. Department of Agriculture had only approved a handful of states for it. “So here comes COVID and it’s like–woah–we need to do something now,” Blue Washington said. In an effort to keep vulnerable populations out of grocery stores, Blue Washington said the federal government decided to fast track approval for additional states. She said Virginia applied in late March and–after getting the green light–DSS got the program online at a speed that’s “unheard of.” Blue Washington said the state is pushing the federal government to approve more vendors in addition to Amazon and Walmart. “We don’t have the power to approve but we do have the power to influence so we are at the table,” she said. Lisa Coles from Goochland, Virginia relies on her local food bank and SNAP benefits to feed her five kids. She said she’d like to see Sam’s Club offer the service, where she feels she can get more for her money. Coles has diabetes and high-blood pressure–conditions that make going to the grocery store right now risky. “It’s scary. So going online is the best way to get your items,” Coles said. Despite that fear, Coles said delivery fees could prevent her from regularly using the online purchasing option. “That will block me from really using it because sometimes those delivery fees can be really high,” Coles said. “You could take that extra money and use it for something else.” Blue Washington said she is concerned that these fees will make delivery inaccessible for the most vulnerable, though certain vendors offer it for free for large purchases. “In order to get it stood up quickly that’s something that we had to forgo but it’s on our list of concerns,” she said. “I just had a conversation literally yesterday about ideas for facilitating change in that area.” LATEST HEADLINES:",0.0

One officer, Derek Chauvin, is seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he continuously yells in distress. Following the nationwide outrage, Chauvin was fired and has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. In Richmond, protesters lined Broad Street and Franklin Street before making their way towards the area of the Governor’s Mansion. 8News reporter Sierra Fox was live near the Virginia State Capitol as protesters shouted the name “George Floyd” in unison.

Protests were largely peaceful as demonstrators marched in the streets from Los Angeles to New York, but in Atlanta, demonstrators set a police car ablaze and broke windows at CNN’s headquarters. Protesters used barricades to break police vehicle windshields and jumped from car to car in Atlanta. Hundreds of the protesters confronted police outside CNN headquarters. They spray-painted the large, iconic CNN logo outside the building, breaking a windowed entrance.

Protesters were also walking on the interstate in downtown Atlanta and appeared to be trying to block traffic. The Georgia State Patrol has responded. Earlier, as the protest appeared more calm, Kaity Brackett, 27, said she came out to the protest because she thinks the entire criminal justice system needs to be overhauled, starting with policing. She said the Ahmaud Arbery killing was a catalyst for her and referred to his death as a lynching. Arbery was killed on Feb. 23 by a former district attorney investigator and his son, who were not arrested until after video emerged months later. Brackett wore a blue mask and sat with her partner and a friend. She was less concerned about the threat from the coronavirus. “We risk our lives going to the grocery store, going to get gas,” she said. “This is more important than all of that.”",0.0

Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the ""abject failure"" of the response to this week's violent protests and called for swift justice for police involved in the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white officer knelt on his neck. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it's time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said, adding. ""Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching."" The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district ""on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" which prompted a warning from Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard's mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources ""never came,"" he said. ""You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,"" Walz said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd's death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis ""under control,"" calling the protesters ""thugs"" and tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform's rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the ""total lack of leadership"" in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: ""What's the plan here?"" ""With regard to?"" Frey responded. Then he added: ""There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable."" He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, ""We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace."" He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were ""clearing the streets and restoring order,"" and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were ""a clear violation of their First Amendment rights."" Firefighters worked Friday to contain a number of blazes as National Guard troops blocked access to streets where businesses had been damaged. They marched side by side and block by block as they expanded a perimeter around a heavily damaged area. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Minutes after the precinct burned, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a ""key objective"" was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York's coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd's death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: ""Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?"" In a follow-up tweet, he said he ""didn't see anything unreasonable."" The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk"" and said he was ""not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd's death.

Protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody Monday, broke out in Minneapolis for a third straight night. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency in one county to activate up to 500 members of the state National Guard ""to protect people & property in Atlanta."" Gov. Brian Kemp said in a pair of tweets early Saturday that the move came at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and in consultation with emergency officials. The Georgia National Guard will deploy ""immediately"" to assist law enforcement, he said. In Minneapolis, where a police precinct was burned the night before, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring an 8 p.m. curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. As a pair of restaurants and a Wells Fargo branch were set ablaze, a heavy contingent of National Guard, state troopers and police moved in, some on foot and some in vehicles. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: ""He said I can't breathe. Justice for George."" They chanted """"No justice, no peace"" and ""Say his name. George Floyd."" One person was killed in downtown Detroit after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters, a Detroit police spokeswoman said Saturday. The shooting occurred about 11:30 p.m. Friday near Detroit’s Greektown entertainment district as officers were confronted with dozens of protesters, said Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood, a police department spokeswoman. She said an officer wasn’t involved in the shooting. Kirkwood said the victim was a 19-year-old man, who was pronounced dead at the hospital. After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting ""Quit your jobs."" At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: ""This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr."" ""You are disgracing our city,"" she told protesters. ""You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home."" Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King's daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. ""We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?"" he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. Protesters gathered outside the White House, with President Donald Trump inside, and some tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to carry off those they arrested. ""We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. ""Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don't ever want to see another night like this."" The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. ""It's my duty to be out here,"" said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. ""Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we're going to be heard."" In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Among them was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. ""My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we're not oppressed."" Tensions rose in several West Coast cities as night fell and protesters blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland. About 1,000 protesters gathered in Oakland. They smashed windows, sprayed buildings with ""Kill Cops"" graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police. Oakland Police were notifying a crowd that the demonstrationwas an unlawful assembly. Authorities said officers were injured when projectiles were thrown and that they were asking people to leave the area. Demonstrators in Los Angeles scuffled at times with police, with a few protesters detained and one officer receiving medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and CNN reported that someone wrote ""killer"" on a patrol car. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was being treated at a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, he and police officials said. Liccardo said his own officers shared the community's outrage over Floyd's in-custody death. ""It was a horrible injustice. I'd venture to guess that every police officer out there feels much of the same anger about what happened in Minneapolis,"" he told The Associated Press. Thirty miles to the west, Santa Cruz police chief Andrew G. Mills said in a statement that the actions by Minneapolis officers in Floyd’s death “are the antithesis of what we view as good policing.” Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON – Police fired pepper spray at demonstrators near the White House and the D.C. National Guard was called in as pockets of violence and vandalism erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response to it. Hundreds of people converged on the White House and marched along the National Mall, chanting “Black Lives Matter,” “I can't breathe” and “No justice, no peace.” Protesters threw water bottles, traffic cones, scooters, even tear gas cans at police lines. They set fire to a car and a trash bin and smashed windows, including at Bay Atlantic University. “What are you doing? That's a school,” one man yelled. An American flag hanging at the Export-Import Bank was taken down, burned and replaced with a Black Lives Matter banner. The D.C. demonstration was one of several around the country responding to the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement to disperse protesters Saturday night. He commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and he also said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” “Let New York’s Finest be New York’s Finest,” Trump said on Twitter after returning to the White House from Florida, where he watched the launch of a SpaceX rocket. He did not talk to reporters upon his return and it was not clear if he could hear the protest over the sound of his helicopter. But for at least part of the flight, televisions on Air Force One were turned to Fox News and its coverage of the protests. Earlier in the day, he had belittled the protesters and pledged to “stop mob violence.” “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,” the president said after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. “Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the missions at hand.” Police were in tactical gear. The D.C. National Guard was activated at the direction of the secretary of the Army and at the request of the Park Police to help maintain order near the White House, Commanding Gen. William J. Walker said in a post on the Guard's Facebook page. “We're sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said. “They're wild. There's just been too many dead boys,” she said. Some vocal protesters directed their comments at a black police officer. “Do you support this violence?” they asked him. “How are you going to protect your kids?” The officer got emotional to the point he had to be relieved. An activist wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt put himself between police and the protesters and yelled, “Stop. This is what they want.” Speaking over a megaphone earlier in the evening, Cameron McCall said, “We don’t need violence. All we need are our voices.” While some protesters stayed near the White House, others marched through the streets chanting, “No justice and no peace.” and “Say his name: George Floyd.” The mood was angry and several speakers implored marchers to remain peaceful. The march paused between the the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Demonstrators sat down in the street for a moment of silence lasting for the eight minutes or more that the Minneapolis police officer reportedly knelt on Floyd's neck. At the Lincoln Memorial, one organizer spoke over a megaphone. “Look to the left and to the right and thank that person. We can't hug anybody because of COVID, but I love you anyway.” Many of the protesters wore masks, but did not socially distance themselves. Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. In a series of tweets earlier Saturday, Trump doubted protesters' allegiance to Floyd’s memory, saying they were “professionally managed.” He offered no evidence to back his assertion, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: “Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” Trump later rejected the suggestion that he was stoking a potential conflict between protesters and his supporters. “I was just asking. But I have no idea if they are going to be here,"" he said. “MAGA is Make America Great Again. By the way, they love African American people. They love black people.” At Saturday's demonstration, there was no evidence of a counter-move by Trump supporters. Trump said he had “watched every move” from inside the executive mansion during Friday's protest and “couldn't have felt more safe” as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, “but whenever someone ... got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard — didn't know what hit them.” The president also criticized the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. Trump said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “is probably a very good person, but he’s a radical, left mayor.” He then described how he watched as a police station in the city was overrun. “For that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I’ve never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life,"" Trump said when speaking briefly to reporters at the White House. He said Minnesota officials have to get tougher with rioters, and that by doing so they would be honoring the memory of Floyd. The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested in Washington and “multiple” officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Saturday called the protesters “criminals” who committed “acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.” Late Saturday and early Sunday, protesters vented their rage by breaking into tony shops of Georgetown, on the western edge of the District, and in downtown Washington, breaking windows and glass doors of many stores and looting some of them. In his tweeting, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were “just waiting for action” and ready to unleash “the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen."" His reference to “vicious dogs” potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation’s capital, called Trump’s remarks “gross” and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation’s fight against segregation. “I call upon our city and our nation to exercise restraint, great restraint, even as the president tries to divide us,” she said. “I feel like these comments are an attack on humanity, an attack on black America, and they make my city less safe.” In contrast with the president’s tweets, the Secret Service said it “respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.” ___ AP video journalist Nathan Ellgren contributed to this report.",0.0

Chiu) ATLANTA – Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country convulsed through another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. — In Indianapolis, police were investigating “multiple shootings” downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. — In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. — In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. — In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah’s governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. — In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. — And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city’s waterfront. “We don’t tolerate excessive use of force,” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to “quell this situation.” Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. “Quite frankly I’m ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. “Yes, you caught us off balance once. It’s not going to happen twice.” This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would “have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has tried to walk back his post-midnight “thugs” tweet about Minneapolis protesters that added to outrage over the police killing of a black man. Trump's repeated condemnation of the killing and outreach to the man's family was a marked change in tone from his earlier comments that also invoked a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump had written in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence.” Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. “Frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump's explanation did little to satisfy hundreds of protesters who gathered outside the White House into early Saturday, shouting “No justice, no peace” as well as an obscene chant directed at the president. Trump's whiplash comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, following three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. And they underscored Trump’s complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order mantle while looking to appeal to black voters during an election year. They also highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department’s efforts to “combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.” In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful “because I've let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" “We don’t mind being accused of police brutality,” he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. Trump, after hours of backlash, said Friday evening that he was unaware of the origins of the phrase. “But I’ve heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said. Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd's family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man's killing, which he called “a terrible insult to police and to policemen.” “I just expressed my sorrow,” Trump told reporters. “He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn’t breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it."" Still, Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful. “The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,"" he said. “Law and order will prevail."" Criticism of the Trump's tweet had been swift, with his presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden saying it was “no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.” “It’s not helpful,"" said Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. “Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.” Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed a chance to help the public cope with “two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.” Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump — who rarely holds his tongue — has been silent in the face of a long list of high-profile killings by police of black men, including Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold and whose dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) He spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players for kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And in one speech he appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after Biden suggested last week that black voters who support Trump “ain’t black.” A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference — and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president’s charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign's plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Twitter's decision to flag Trump's tweet — the second time it has acted this week — came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant's protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, accusing the White House of promoting violence. Supporters of the president balked at the move. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of “purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.”",0.0
1620703217,2020-05-30 02:38:59,"Biden speaks of racial 'open wound,' contrasting with Trump",https://www.wsls.com/news/politics/2020/05/30/biden-speaks-of-racial-open-wound-contrasting-with-trump/,en,False,,90694,wsls.com,http://www.wsls.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON – Joe Biden lamented the “open wound” of the nation's systemic racism on Friday as he responded to the police killing of a black man in Minnesota. He drew an implicit contrast with President Donald Trump, who has suggested authorities could respond with violence to the protests that followed George Floyd’s death. “The original sin of this country still stains our nation today,” Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in remarks broadcast from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. ""It’s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.” Biden announced his bid for the presidency last year arguing he’s uniquely positioned to unite a deeply divided country. He pointed to Trump’s response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as unworthy of America’s people and values. As the country endures another spasm of racial unrest, the central premise of Biden’s campaign is being tested. Biden is responding by positioning himself as an empathetic counter to Trump, who often struggles to convey emotion or connect on a personal level during moments of crisis. Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family and demanded justice for his death while calling for “real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet.” The president later said that he, too, had spoken with Floyd's family and called them “terrific people.” Trump initially condemned police actions in Floyd’s death but later agitated the unrest by tweeting that protesters could be met with violent police resistance. He threatened to take action to bring Minneapolis “under control,” called violent protesters outraged by the killing “thugs” and revived a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump wrote in a tweet that was flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence.” The White House said the president “did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it.” By Friday afternoon, Trump sought to acknowledge the shocking circumstances of Floyd’s death while commending law enforcement. “He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn’t breathe,” the president said of Floyd. “It was a very, very sad thing for me to see it. We also know that most policemen, you see the great job they do."" Biden, without mentioning Trump by name, made clear he would approach the presidency differently. “This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence,” Biden said. “This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism.” Later appearing on PBS, Biden pointed more openly at Trump: “I think this president has stoked racism.” Rep. Val Demings, a Florida Democrat considered a potential Biden running mate, criticized Trump's response. “America is on fire,” she said in an interview Friday. “And this president is standing there with gasoline. He is dangerous. He’s destructive, he’s dangerous and he can’t even rise to this occasion.” Amid the outrage, Biden tried to make the rest of the country feel what it was like to be African American in modern U.S. society. “Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering who will be next,” he said, adding, “the anger and the frustration and the exhaustion — it’s undeniable.” Biden must go beyond establishing himself as a calming alternative to the president and demonstrate that he will take action that spurs the unity he's promised. It’s a feat he may have to accomplish in a hurry if he wants to inspire African Americans to turn out for him in November. The task is especially critical after Biden suggested last week that African American voters who were still undecided between him and Trump “ain't black,” a comment that some black leaders said were interpreted as taking their votes for granted. Biden quickly said he regretted the comment. NAACP President Derrick Johnson said he believes the nation is in chaos because of a lack of leadership in the White House. But he said change will only come by putting people in positions of power who will be willing to boldly address the needs of affected communities. “I think the real question is, what are people going to do about it and how are those who are in positions of authority, and those who are seeking positions of authority, how are they going to lay out a plan moving forward?” Johnson said. “It’s about what is the collective will of this society to address the systemic deficits that we all know so well but lack the political will to address.” Moments of acute racial tension have afforded platforms for leadership from presidential candidates in the past.

He drew an implicit contrast with President Donald Trump, who has suggested authorities could respond with violence to the protests that followed George Floyd's death. 'The original sin of this country still stains our nation today,' Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in remarks broadcast from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. ""It's time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.' Biden announced his bid for the presidency last year arguing he's uniquely positioned to unite a deeply divided country. He pointed to Trump's response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as unworthy of America's people and values. As the country endures another spasm of racial unrest, the central premise of Biden's campaign is being tested. Biden is responding by positioning himself as an empathetic counter to Trump, who often struggles to convey emotion or connect on a personal level during moments of crisis. Biden said he spoke with Floyd's family and demanded justice for his death while calling for 'real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet.' The president later said that he, too, had spoken with Floyd's family and called them 'terrific people.' Trump initially condemned police actions in Floyd's death but later agitated the unrest by tweeting that protesters could be met with violent police resistance. He threatened to take action to bring Minneapolis 'under control,' called violent protesters outraged by the killing 'thugs' and revived a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts,' Trump wrote in a tweet that was flagged by Twitter as violating rules against 'glorifying violence.' The White House said the president 'did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it.' By Friday afternoon, Trump sought to acknowledge the shocking circumstances of Floyd's death while commending law enforcement. 'He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn't breathe,' the president said of Floyd. 'It was a very, very sad thing for me to see it. We also know that most policemen, you see the great job they do."" Biden, without mentioning Trump by name, made clear he would approach the presidency differently. 'This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence,' Biden said. 'This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism.' Later appearing on PBS, Biden pointed more openly at Trump: 'I think this president has stoked racism.' Rep. Val Demings, a Florida Democrat considered a potential Biden running mate, criticized Trump's response. 'America is on fire,' she said in an interview Friday. 'And this president is standing there with gasoline. He is dangerous. He's destructive, he's dangerous and he can't even rise to this occasion.' Amid the outrage, Biden tried to make the rest of the country feel what it was like to be African American in modern U.S. society. 'Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering who will be next,' he said, adding, 'the anger and the frustration and the exhaustion "" it's undeniable.' Biden must go beyond establishing himself as a calming alternative to the president and demonstrate that he will take action that spurs the unity he's promised. It's a feat he may have to accomplish in a hurry if he wants to inspire African Americans to turn out for him in November. The task is especially critical after Biden suggested last week that African American voters who were still undecided between him and Trump 'ain't black,' a comment that some black leaders said were interpreted as taking their votes for granted. Biden quickly said he regretted the comment. NAACP President Derrick Johnson said he believes the nation is in chaos because of a lack of leadership in the White House. But he said change will only come by putting people in positions of power who will be willing to boldly address the needs of affected communities. 'I think the real question is, what are people going to do about it and how are those who are in positions of authority, and those who are seeking positions of authority, how are they going to lay out a plan moving forward?' Johnson said. 'It's about what is the collective will of this society to address the systemic deficits that we all know so well but lack the political will to address.'

1620733367,2020-05-30 01:50:56,Trump walks back his incendiary Minneapolis 'thugs' post,https://www.progress-index.com/ZZ/news/20200530/trump-walks-back-his-incendiary-minneapolis-thugs-post?rssfeed=true,en,True,,147801,progress-index.com,http://progress-index.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" President Donald Trump has tried to walk back his post-midnight 'thugs' tweet about Minneapolis protesters that added to outrage over the police killing of a black man. Trump's repeated condemnation of the killing and outreach to the man's family was a marked change in tone from his earlier comments that also invoked a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts,' Trump had written in a tweet that was quickly flagged by Twitter as violating rules against 'glorifying violence.' Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. 'Frankly it means when there's looting, people get shot and they die,' he said. Trump's explanation did little to satisfy hundreds of protesters who gathered outside the White House into early Saturday, shouting 'No justice, no peace' as well as an obscene chant directed at the president. Trump's whiplash comments came after protesters torched a Minneapolis police station on Thursday night, following three days of searing demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, who was captured on video pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. And they underscored Trump's complicated relationship with race as he tries to maintain a law-and-order mantle while looking to appeal to black voters during an election year. They also highlighted his refusal to avoid controversy or cede the spotlight even as the battered nation tries to make sense of another killing and reels over the mounting COVID-19 death toll. Trump, in his tweets, borrowed a phrase once used by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department's efforts to 'combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.' In the speech, Headley said his department had been successful 'because I've let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" 'We don't mind being accused of police brutality,' he said in the same speech, according to news reports from the time. Trump, after hours of backlash, said Friday evening that he was unaware of the origins of the phrase. 'But I've heard it for a long time, as most people have. And frankly it means when there's looting, people get shot and they die,' he said. Trump also revealed that he had been in touch with Floyd's family as he continued to denounce the circumstances of the man's killing, which he called 'a terrible insult to police and to policemen.' 'I just expressed my sorrow,' Trump told reporters. 'He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn't breathe. And it was very obvious to anybody that watched it."" Still, Trump called on protesters to keep their demonstrations peaceful. 'The family of George is entitled to justice, and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety,"" he said. 'Law and order will prevail."" Criticism of the Trump's tweet had been swift, with his presumptive Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden saying it was 'no time for incendiary tweets, no time to incite violence.' 'It's not helpful,"" said Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. 'Anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging.' Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said that, as the country passed the grim milestone of more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, Trump had missed a chance to help the public cope with 'two viruses: One is the coronavirus and the other is the virus of racial animus.' Trump has been accused of stoking racial tensions and exploiting divisions for personal gain since long before he ran for president, beginning with the full-page ads he ran in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of assaulting a white jogger. Trump "" who rarely holds his tongue "" has been silent in the face of a long list of high-profile killings by police of black men, including Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold and whose dying words, 'I can't breathe,' became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. (Trump has instead invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.) He spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players for kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And in one speech he appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. At the same time, Trump and his campaign have tried to make inroads with black Americans, particularly after Biden suggested last week that black voters who support Trump 'ain't black.' A bedrock of the Democratic base, black Americans are unlikely to embrace Trump en masse, but his campaign believes even a marginal shift could make a difference "" and send a message to white voters uneasy about the president's charged rhetoric. Meanwhile, the unrest complicates the Trump campaign's plans for Minnesota, one of the key swing states he hopes to win in November. Twitter's decision to flag Trump's tweet "" the second time it has acted this week "" came a day after he signed an executive order challenging the social media giant's protections against lawsuits as he accuses it of stifling conservative voices. The warning label prevented the tweet from being shared or liked, though it could still be viewed by users. The White House, trying to skirt the blockage, reposted the message on its own official Twitter account Friday morning. Twitter quickly flagged that tweet, too, accusing the White House of promoting violence. Supporters of the president balked at the move. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale accused the media, Biden and other Democrats of 'purposefully misrepresenting what the President had said, and showing once again that they are incapable of resisting their base impulse of dividing Americans, solely for the purpose of political gain, ratings, and cable news profit.'",0.0

National Guard was called in as pockets of violence and vandalism erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response to it. Hundreds of people converged on the White House and marched along the National Mall, chanting 'Black Lives Matter,' 'I can't breathe' and 'No justice, no peace.' Protesters threw water bottles, traffic cones, scooters, even tear gas cans at police lines. They set fire to a car and a trash bin and smashed windows, including at Bay Atlantic University. 'What are you doing? That's a school,' one man yelled. An American flag hanging at the Export-Import Bank was taken down, burned and replaced with a Black Lives Matter banner. The D.C. demonstration was one of several around the country responding to the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement to disperse protesters Saturday night. He commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and he also said police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' 'Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest,' Trump said on Twitter after returning to the White House from Florida, where he watched the launch of a SpaceX rocket. He did not talk to reporters upon his return and it was not clear if he could hear the protest over the sound of his helicopter. But for at least part of the flight, televisions on Air Force One were turned to Fox News and its coverage of the protests. Earlier in the day, he had belittled the protesters and pledged to 'stop mob violence.' 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,' the president said after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. 'Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the missions at hand.' Police were in tactical gear. The D.C. National Guard was activated at the direction of the secretary of the Army and at the request of the Park Police to help maintain order near the White House, Commanding Gen. William J. Walker said in a post on the Guard's Facebook page. 'We're sick of it. The cops are out of control,' protester Olga Hall said. 'They're wild. There's just been too many dead boys,' she said. Some vocal protesters directed their comments at a black police officer. 'Do you support this violence?' they asked him. 'How are you going to protect your kids?' The officer got emotional to the point he had to be relieved. An activist wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt put himself between police and the protesters and yelled, 'Stop. This is what they want.' Speaking over a megaphone earlier in the evening, Cameron McCall said, 'We don't need violence. All we need are our voices.' While some protesters stayed near the White House, others marched through the streets chanting, 'No justice and no peace.' and 'Say his name: George Floyd.' The mood was angry and several speakers implored marchers to remain peaceful. The march paused between the the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Demonstrators sat down in the street for a moment of silence lasting for the eight minutes or more that the Minneapolis police officer reportedly knelt on Floyd's neck. At the Lincoln Memorial, one organizer spoke over a megaphone. 'Look to the left and to the right and thank that person. We can't hug anybody because of COVID, but I love you anyway.' Many of the protesters wore masks, but did not socially distance themselves. Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. In a series of tweets earlier Saturday, Trump doubted protesters' allegiance to Floyd's memory, saying they were 'professionally managed.' He offered no evidence to back his assertion, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: 'Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???' Trump later rejected the suggestion that he was stoking a potential conflict between protesters and his supporters. 'I was just asking. But I have no idea if they are going to be here,"" he said. 'MAGA is Make America Great Again. By the way, they love African American people. They love black people.' At Saturday's demonstration, there was no evidence of a counter-move by Trump supporters. Trump said he had 'watched every move' from inside the executive mansion during Friday's protest and 'couldn't have felt more safe' as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, 'but whenever someone ... got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard "" didn't know what hit them.' The president also criticized the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. Trump said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey 'is probably a very good person, but he's a radical, left mayor.' He then described how he watched as a police station in the city was overrun. 'For that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I've never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life,"" Trump said when speaking briefly to reporters at the White House. He said Minnesota officials have to get tougher with rioters, and that by doing so they would be honoring the memory of Floyd. The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested in Washington and 'multiple' officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Saturday called the protesters 'criminals' who committed 'acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.' Late Saturday and early Sunday, protesters vented their rage by breaking into tony shops of Georgetown, on the western edge of the District, and in downtown Washington, breaking windows and glass doors of many stores and looting some of them. In his tweeting, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were 'just waiting for action' and ready to unleash 'the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen."" His reference to 'vicious dogs' potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation's capital, called Trump's remarks 'gross' and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation's fight against segregation. 'I call upon our city and our nation to exercise restraint, great restraint, even as the president tries to divide us,' she said. 'I feel like these comments are an attack on humanity, an attack on black America, and they make my city less safe.' In contrast with the president's tweets, the Secret Service said it 'respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.' ___ AP video journalist Nathan Ellgren contributed to this report.",0.0

Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) MINNEAPOLIS – Fires burned unchecked and thousands protesting the police killing of George Floyd ignored a curfew as unrest overwhelmed authorities for another night in Minneapolis, and the governor acknowledged Saturday that he didn't have enough manpower to contain the chaos. The new round of tumult — which has also spread to other cities — came despite Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz vowing Friday to show a more forceful response than city leaders had the day before. But by early Saturday morning, Walz said he didn’t have enough troops, even with some 500 National Guardsmen. “We do not have the numbers,” Walz said. “We cannot arrest people when we are trying to hold ground.” Walz said he was moving quickly to mobilize more than 1,000 more Guard members, for a total of 1,700, and was considering the potential offer of federal military police. But he warned that even that might not be enough, saying he expected another difficult night Saturday. The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to the city on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The rare step came as the violence spread to other cities: A man shot dead in Detroit, police cars battered in Atlanta and skirmishes with police in New York City. Criminal charges filed Friday morning against the white officer who held his knee for nearly nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed at the time, did nothing to stem the anger. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Minneapolis police said shots had been fired at law enforcement officers during the protests but no one was injured. As the night dragged on, fires erupted across the city's south side, including at a Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank and an Office Depot. Many burned for hours, with firefighters again delayed in reaching them because areas weren't secure. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence, one day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. On Thursday, protesters had torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and went on to burn or vandalize dozens of businesses. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association urged Gov. Walz to accept any help. “You need more resources,” the group said in a tweet. “Law enforcement needs leadership.” Not all the protests were violent. Downtown, thousands of demonstrators encircled a barricaded police station after the 8 p.m. Friday curfew. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” Some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. Anger filled the streets of Minneapolis. Ben Hubert, a 26-year-old local resident, said he wasn’t surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. “I’m outraged,” he said of the Floyd case. “But I’m also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It’s been swelling for years.” Chauvin was also accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he pleaded that he could not breathe, while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case four days after Floyd’s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. Trump said Friday that he’d spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow.” He called video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City. He was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd’s death. ___ Associated Press writers Amy Forliti, Steve Karnowski, and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, Bernard Condon in New York, and James LaPorta in Delray Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.",0.0

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings) LOUISVILLE, Ky. – Kentucky’s governor on Saturday called in the National Guard to “help keep the peace” in Louisville after a second night of protests sparked by the police shooting of a black woman led to widespread damage. Gov. Andy Beshear said he didn’t want to silence protesters but decided to activate the Guard to quell the actions of “outside groups” that are “trying to create violence.” His action came after the unrest Friday night spread through parts of downtown Louisville, resulting in windows being shattered and small fires being set. Police said six people were arrested during Friday’s protest, which began peacefully but grew more destructive as the night went on. During the protests, a police officer was seen on camera firing what appeared to be pepper balls at a news crew during a live television broadcast. A crew from WAVE-TV was on air when reporter Kaitlin Rust was heard yelling off-camera: “I’ve been shot! I’ve been shot!” Video shows a police officer aiming directly at the camera crew, as Rust describes the projectiles as “pepper bullets.” A clip of the WAVE-TV broadcast posted to Twitter amassed more than 8 million views in less than six hours, and was retweeted more than 50,000 times, including by other journalists and rapper Ice-T. Louisville Police spokeswoman Jesse Halladay apologized for the incident. Halladay said police would review the video and “if we need to do any investigation for discipline, we will do that.” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, standing in front of a business with broken windows Saturday morning, imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Kentucky’s largest city. “The tone clearly changed last night. The number of people on our street clearly changed last night, as well,” Fischer said. “This turned from being a peaceful protest into violence and terrorism and looting on the streets of our city.” Several downtown businesses had windows shattered and graffiti sprayed on walls. About 350 National Guard members will be sent to Louisville to assist police Saturday afternoon. Louisville’s protests followed the release of a 911 call by shooting victim Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend made March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in her home. Taylor’s death has captured national headlines alongside the killings of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia in February and George Floyd, the black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes as he pleaded for air. Protesters carried signs calling for justice for Taylor and Floyd, whose death has touched off protests across the country this week. The use of nonlethal force on the WAVE-TV crew happened the same day CNN employees were arrested live on air while covering protests in Minnesota. Gunfire erupted during earlier Louisville protests on Thursday night, wounding seven people. Beshear, a Democrat, has pledged to listen to the frustrations of protesters and to “do everything I can to help moving forward.” But he said he wants to make sure that “we are all safe” in deciding to call in guardsmen to reinforce Louisville police. “The demonstrations in Louisville have all started peacefully, but what we have seen, especially last night, and what our intelligence says is going to happen, are outside groups moving in, trying to create violence to harm everybody who is on those streets,” Beshear said Saturday. “We cannot let Breonna’s legacy be marred by violence, and we can’t let our streets turn violent.”",0.0

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (David Joles/Star Tribune via AP) MINNEAPOLIS – Years of dialogue about police and criminal justice reforms in Minneapolis had improved the relationship between the African American community and law enforcement, activists say — before the police killing this week of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes as he pleaded for air. Floyd's death and footage of his neck pinned under the officer's knee have unleashed protests and violent clashes with law enforcement — exposing simmering frustration and the fact that there’s much work still ahead, several advocates and leaders told The Associated Press. “Progress and change can ebb and flow,” said Jeremiah Ellison, who won a City Council seat after participating in past protests against police killings of African Americans in Minnesota. The four nights of unrest this week — including the torching of a police station that officers abandoned — “proved to me that we’ve regressed to the point of 2015,” Ellison said, referring to the year that also saw protests after the death of Jamar Clark, a black man killed by police. Minneapolis — a city of nearly 430,000 that is 60% white, 19% black and 9% Hispanic — has a long history of economic and educational disparities that have marginalized black residents for decades, despite its reputation for progressive values. It is one of the most segregated cities in the country for its size, and schools suffer from stubborn achievement gaps. The city appointed its first black chief of police nearly three years ago, after slow progress toward making the department more inclusive. Earlier this year, a statewide task force made up of activists, people representing victims of police brutality, and law enforcement leaders released recommendations for policing reforms. That task force was formed in the wake of several high-profile fatal shootings of black men by police in the Minneapolis area. Those included Clark, who was killed during a struggle with two white Minneapolis officers, and Philando Castile, who was fatally shot by a Hispanic suburban police officer during a traffic stop in 2016. While Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and former president of the Minneapolis NAACP, acknowledges that progress, she said that many old habits are still entrenched. “The system itself has not changed,"" Armstrong said. ""The culture within the Minneapolis Police Department has not changed.” The city’s police department of more than 800 officers is still predominantly white, she said. The department did not respond to a request for up-to-date figures, but the Star Tribune reported in 2014 that the force, including cadets in field training, was 78.9% white, 9.2% black, 5.2% Asian, 4.1% Hispanic and 2.5% American Indian. Some leaders, including former Mayor R.T. Rybak and state Sen. Jeff Hayden, have blamed the city's police union in recent days for fostering a culture that protects brutal officers and resists efforts at reform. The union's president, Lt. Bob Kroll, did not return a call seeking comment. The eruption of anger in Minneapolis reflects frustration over these realities, despite some progress, said Teqen Zéa-Aida, a longtime activist in the city. But the images themselves also demanded a “public response,” he said, though he pushed for protests to happen online given the risks of gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. “We saw his eyes ... we saw a lynching. George Floyd is Emmett Till, 2020,” he said, referring to the black 14-year-old who was abducted, beaten and killed in 1955 after he was accused of whistling at a white woman in Mississippi, a lynching that helped spur the civil rights movement. Bystander video and photos of the arrest show Floyd on the ground with his neck under Officer Derek Chauvin's knee, while Chauvin ignores his pleas for help. Two other officers appear to help hold him down, and a fourth attempts to keep space around the scene. “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe,” Floyd says in the video before eventually becoming motionless. Police initially said they arrested Floyd because he matched the description of a man suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a grocery store and that he resisted arrest. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, according to the criminal complaint detailing charges against Chauvin. In addition to igniting the turmoil in Minneapolis, Floyd’s death has garnered national attention, and it drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and also said he could not breathe. The delay in Chauvin's arrest may have also helped to drive the protests, which turned markedly more violent than those that followed the deaths of either Clark or Castile. Authorities arrested Chauvin and charged him Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His attorney had no comment when reached by the AP. The other three officers involved have not been charged, but the investigation is continuing. All four were fired Tuesday shortly after the video began circulating. Some activists and community leaders said they expected the protests to continue to push for the arrests of and charges for the three other officers. Floyd’s death “just touched people in a way that they didn’t expect,” said Armstrong. “We must get to the underlying solutions or we will be right back here in a fairly short time,” said Keith Ellison, the state's first African American attorney general, whose son is the Minneapolis city councilman. “We’ve got to literally shift policing.” Ramsey County Undersheriff Bill Finney, who in 1992 became the first African American police chief in Minnesota when he was appointed to the job in neighboring St. Paul, said even when the relationship between police and the black community improves, all sides must guard against complacency. “You have to constantly make deposits into the community bank of goodwill,” Finney said. “You want to get to a place where the community stops considering you as ‘the police’ and starts seeing you as their police.” ___ Morrison and Nasir are members of the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

Several hours after the 8 p.m. curfew began, there were ""no reported injuries of consequence,"" Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told the media. He acknowledged that the situation could change as the night continued. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey reported at least two dozen arrests were made Saturday night and said it was too early to say whether the curfew would be extended another night. Earlier Frey said even peaceful protests weren't welcome after the curfew. Highways were closed and officials urged all residents to stay home, saying it was necessary to separate peaceful protesters from those intending to cause further damage to a city reeling after days of fiery demonstrations. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Minnesota governor Tim Walz said. Local officials' increasingly strict stance comes after days of violence in the city, with Thursday night's unrest being the most chaotic as protesters breached a police precinct building and set it on fire. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer kept his knee pressed into his neck for more than eight minutes, sparking dozens of protests against police brutality across the country. City-by-city look:George Floyd protests continue Saturday, cities begin issuing curfews Thousands of people took to the streets nationwide and hundreds were arrested Friday and into early Saturday morning, resulting in injuries to protesters and officers. By sunrise, at least three people had died amid the protests. Demonstrations continued throughout the day Saturday in dozens of cities, and more protests were planned and curfews issued for Saturday evening. Follow USA TODAY reporters Trevor Hughes and Tyler Davis for reports from the scene. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. Here are the latest developments: Minnesota Department of Transportation announced multiple highway closures in the Twin Cities, starting at 7 p.m. Saturday. ""Routes will remain open for motorists to exit downtown areas,"" the department tweeted. Officials expected demonstrators to set fires, use deadly force and use ""civilians as shields from law enforcement,"" the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted before and after curfew began. As part of the state's increased enforcement, the Minnesota National Guard said more than 4,100 service members had been deployed to the Twin Cities and projected more than 10,000 would soon be called up. Who is causing the violence? Extremists are hijacking peaceful protests, officials say Read this: Experts say knee-to-neck restraint is dangerous, but Minneapolis allows it. Tear gas, smoke bombs and explosions near Fifth Precinct Hundreds of protesters sat to await the arrival of law enforcement as curfew approached near Fifth Precinct. One commented that police couldn't arrest the whole group. Soon, black-clad law enforcement approached to the sound of explosions. Some demonstrators chanted “Hands up, don’t shoot!” Police officers fired nonlethal projectiles toward masses of people, including a crowd of media gathered in an alley next to a looted store. Protesters reported tear gas being used. Some people hobbled away from an intersection appearing to be injured. ""State Patrol troopers are moving in to secure the Fifth Precinct. Go home and obey the curfew order now,"" Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. An empty street fills as curfew falls near Lake Street Minneapolis' Lake Street was the scene of running battles between protesters, law-enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard on Friday night. But as curfew began Saturday, it was nearly empty and eerily quiet. Smoke still wafted from some of the burned-out buildings, including the Third Precinct police substation. Earlier in the day, hundreds of volunteers swept clean the debris that once clogged the streets. Soon, the area was filled with people again as a crowd materialized. A group headed across the Mississippi River bridge on Lake Street from Minneapolis toward Saint Paul, initially with no sign of law enforcement. Moments later, police pushed back the large protest group. Under a heavy barrage of flash-bangs and smoke grenades, the group quickly retreated, chanting “We come in peace, we mean no harm.” Officials walk back claims about out-of-state arrests Walz and Carter alleged early Saturday that many of the protesters inciting violence and causing destruction were from outside the state but later acknowledged current data does not support that claim. A civil arrest list provided by the public information officer of the St. Paul Police Department shows 12 of the 18 people arrested from Thursday through 6 a.m. Saturday were from Minnesota. Five of them are from St. Paul, three are from Woodbury (part of the Twin Cities metropolitan area), two are from Minneapolis, one is from Mankato and one is from St. Louis Park. Four are from out of state and two did not have cities of residence listed. Carter said his statements were based on data he later learned was inaccurate. Walz said arrests made Saturday night will give officials a “much bigger data set” of where protestors are from. As grocery stores close in Minneapolis, volunteers offer help Volunteers on the north side of Minneapolis on Saturday afternoon turned parking lots into makeshift markets to combat a dearth of grocery stores in the area. At the intersection of West Broadway and Emerson avenues, about 250 people filled the lots at U.S. Bank and Episcopal Church in Minnesota to drop off and pick up donations from members of the community. Amanda Kelli, 18, has relatives who live on the north side and said it’s been a struggle to find food the past few days. “My family has been looking for somewhere to go grocery shopping — my mom, my dad my grandma,” she said, as she held her baby and chowed on pizza. “But we couldn’t find nothing so we came here.” All businesses along Broadway appeared to be closed as of Saturday afternoon due to violent protests the past two nights. Breyonne Golding, a community planner, called the donation effort “healing” for a low-income area usually starved of resources, but even more so now. “On the north side, there’s only three grocery stores. All of them are boarded up,” said Golding, a native of Connecticut. “It’s about to be the first of the month, where are they gonna get food?” Omar to Minneapolis residents: ‘Stay home tonight’ Rep. Ilhan Omar asked Minneapolis residents to stay home Saturday night in an effort to isolate ""agitators"" she says are destroying minority owned business during protests over the death of Floyd. Omar, D-Minn., represents the district where Floyd was killed. ""Right now, our grief and pain is being exploited. People primarily from outside our city are destroying black and minority-owned businesses in our city,” Omar said. “We can’t let them. Let us all prioritize justice for George Floyd, police reform, alongside the safety of our community and the prevention of more violence. I urge people to stay home tonight so we can better target and isolate these agitators.” – Sean Rossman Minnesota National Guard plans to deploy as many as 10,000 soldiers The Minnesota National Guard planned to deploy as many as 10,000 troops to respond to unrest in Minneapolis, a massive increase over the 850 now on duty. Meanwhile, the Pentagon offered to assist Minnesota with active-duty troops. So far, Walz has not sought help from federal troops, according to a statement from Jonathan Hoffman, a Defense Department spokesman. Walz said this morning that he had spoken with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on Saturday, as well as with mayors across the country, and was ""fully mobilizing"" the state's National Guard for the first time in Minnesota's history. Walz alleged that the protests were fueled by elements of domestic terrorism, ideological extremists and international destabilization. 'Stay home tonight,' officials and community leaders plead In an afternoon news conference, Minnesota officials asked residents to forgo protests and stay home after 8 p.m. Saturday night so that law enforcement could ""remove those folks who are harming us."" Community and faith leaders – including reverends, rabbis, imams and representatives of the state's Latino, Asian, and Native American communities, as well as the uncle of Philando Castile – encouraged residents to observe the curfew. ""We need to create the space for people to be able to grieve, to come together, to mourn the loss of George Floyd,"" Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said in an afternoon news conference. ""We cannot do that until community can gather safely ... Stay home tonight so that we can remove those folks who are harming us."" Flanagan said that some of the protesters were ""detractors,"" ""white supremacists"" and ""anarchists."" ""They are not from our state, and they're coming from the outside,"" and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. ""We cannot move forward when people are burning down our city."" Volunteers begin cleaning up Across Minneapolis, groups of volunteers spontaneously appeared to begin cleaning up the damage Saturday morning. Leaning on her shovel while talking, social worker Kara Vangen, 58, said no one should mistake the cleanup as a criticism of the protests themselves. ""I’m supporting the protesting, completely. And this is my neighborhood, so this is part of the healing,"" she said, over the scrape of shovels clearing rubble from a burned-out Walgreens. Wearing face masks, Anton Reuter and Beno Boda, both 17, picked up trash strewn in the street. The two, who live nearby, said they had heard reports that troublemakers from outside downtown Minneapolis have been flooding into the area last night causing damage. They wanted people to know that those who live here care about this neighborhood. ""It’s not going to get better waiting on the government,"" Boda said. Morning in Minneapolis: Firefighters put out blazes, clear rubble As Saturday morning dawned in Minneapolis, authorities had moved back into some formerly contested areas, and firefighters with the Minneapolis Fire Department poured water onto a still-smoldering gas station in the Hiawatha area as a small crowd watched. No police were present. Over on Lake Street at Columbus Avenue, members of the Minnesota National Guard controlled access to the streets, their Humvees and trucks blocking the road as firefighters and public works officials tried to shut off leaking gas lines and clear rubble from the road. Because some areas lost power, drivers collided yesterday when speeding through stoplights that weren’t working, and their abandoned crashed cars were then set ablaze. Broken glass from shattered windows and bus stops crunched underfoot. ""This is sad. It’s very emotional right now. I just had to come down and see it,"" said Brian Ledin, 58, who lives in a nearby suburb but was born in the area. Smoke rose from an O’Reilly Auto Parts store and CenterPoint energy workers searched for broken gas lines. Report: Military police could be dispatched to Minnesota The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to Minneapolis on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, the Associated Press reports, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. According to the AP report, soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called. Soldiers in Fort Carson in Colorado and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. Fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin arrested, booked Derek Michael Chauvin, 44, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection to Floyd's death. He was booked into the Ramsey County Jail. A criminal complaint that references body cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. Read more.",0.0
1621035549,2020-05-30 12:45:22,AP Explains: Trump actions on Hong Kong just threats for now,https://www.wsls.com/news/politics/2020/05/30/ap-explains-trump-actions-on-hong-kong-just-threats-for-now/,en,False,,90694,wsls.com,http://www.wsls.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has announced what he said are “significant actions” regarding U.S. relations with Hong Kong. But the measures are still just a warning, at least for now. He said he would direct his administration to begin eliminating the policies that give the semi-autonomous Chinese territory a distinct trade and legal relationship with the United States. But he didn't say when. He also mentioned there would be a “few exceptions” but he didn’t take any questions at his announcement Friday. So, while tensions are high, the status quo seems to hold. A look at where things stand: WHAT EXACTLY DID TRUMP ANNOUNCE? The president, in a brief Rose Garden appearance, announced a series of moves that included withdrawing U.S. financial support for the World Health Organization, in protest of its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, and the suspension of visas for some Chinese graduate students suspected of gathering research on behalf of their country's military. He said he would direct his administration to “begin the process of eliminating policy exemptions that give Hong Kong different and special treatment” in its relations with the U.S. Trump said this would “affect the full range of agreements” between the U.S. and Hong Kong. Trump specifically mentioned only the extradition treaty that dates to Hong Kong's days as a British colony, and technology export controls and said there would be “few exceptions.” ___ WHY IS THIS HAPPENING NOW? Trump came into office with a hostile view of China and an oft-stated desire to overhaul U.S. trade policies that he believes have hurt the American economy. Some of that eased in January when he signed a trade deal with China. But the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan province and Trump's suspicion that the Chinese government hid the severity of the situation have added a degree of volatility to long-standing points of tension between the two countries over a number of issues, including human rights abuses and the status of Hong Kong. U.S. officials and members of Congress have expressed increasing alarm about Hong Kong, and there have been widespread protests there over a series of moves by China to exert greater control over the territory. Under the terms of a China-Britain agreement, Hong Kong was to have enjoyed significant autonomy from the communist government in Beijing for 50 years, starting in 1997. The Trump administration argues that agreement has been undermined by a new security law imposed by the Chinese government that eliminates some of the limited political freedoms people of Hong Kong had enjoyed. “Hong Kong is no longer sufficiently autonomous to warrant the special treatment that we have afforded the territory since the handover,"" Trump said Friday. ___ WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC STAKES IN HONG KONG? American law commits the United States to treat Hong Kong as separate from the rest of China in a variety of political and economic areas as long as Hong Kong is “sufficiently autonomous” from the rest of China. As a result, the U.S. has bilateral agreements on trade, investment, law enforcement with Hong Kong. Hong Kong is exempt from the tariffs applied to goods from the mainland, and the U.S. has a large trade surplus with the territory. Hundreds of American companies have offices there, and about 85,000 American citizens live in Hong Kong. Last year, Congress, where there is strong bipartisan support for penalizing China over human rights abuses, passed legislation directing the administration to impose penalties on Chinese officials involved in cracking down in Hong Kong. ___ WHAT HAPPENS NOW? It's unclear. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified Congress this ;past week that the administration no longer regards Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China. That set the stage for the U.S. to withdraw its preferential trade and financial status in consultation with Congress. But it's likely to be a long process that serves to put China on notice that Hong Kong's perks are in jeopardy. Trump said he directed his administration to “begin” the process of eliminating the exemptions that benefit Hong Kong but he did not say when this would happen. Much will depend on those “few exceptions” that he referenced in his remarks Friday. He did say the administration would punish Chinese officials involved in the Hong Kong crackdown — something that Congress had already directed the administration to do — and that seems likely to be the next step.",0.0

Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (AP) — As unrest spread across dozens of American cities on Friday, the Pentagon took the rare step of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis, where the police killing of George Floyd sparked the widespread protests. Soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders. Soldiers in Fort Carson, in Colorado, and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. The people did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The get-ready orders were sent verbally on Friday, after President Donald Trump asked Defense Secretary Mark Esper for military options to help quell the unrest in Minneapolis after protests descended into looting and arson in some parts of the city. Trump made the request on a phone call from the Oval Office on Thursday night that included Esper, National Security Advisor Robert O’ Brien and several others. The president asked Esper for rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to one of the people, a senior Pentagon official who was on the call. ”When the White House asks for options, someone opens the drawer and pulls them out so to speak.” the official said. The person said the military units would be deployed under the Insurrection Act of 1807, which was last used in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial. “If this is where the president is headed response-wise, it would represent a significant escalation and a determination that the various state and local authorities are not up to the task of responding to the growing unrest,” said Brad Moss, a Washington D.C.-based attorney, who specializes in national security. Members of the police units were on a 30-minute recall alert early Saturday, meaning they would have to return to their bases inside that time limit in preparation for deployment to Minneapolis inside of four hours. Units at Fort Drum are slated to head to Minneapolis first, according to the three people, including two Defense Department officials. Roughly 800 U.S. soldiers would deploy to the city if called. Protests erupted in Minneapolis this week after video emerged showing a police officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck. Floyd later died of his injuries and the officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. The protests turned violent and on Thursday rioters torched the Minneapolis Third Police Precinct near where Floyd was arrested. Mayor Jacob Frey ordered a citywide curfew at 8 p.m. local time, beginning on Friday. In that city, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring the curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. The unrest has since spread across the country, with protests, some violent, erupting in cities including Washington DC, Atlanta, Phoenix, Denver and Los Angelas. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz ordered 500 of his National Guard troops into Minneapolis, St. Paul, and surrounding communities. But a Pentagon spokesman said Walz did not ask for the Army to be deployed to his state. “The Department has been in touch with the Governor and there is no request for Title 10 forces to support the Minnesota National Guard or state law enforcement,” the spokesman said, Title 10 is the U.S. law that governs the armed forces, and would authorize active duty military to operate within the U.S. Alyssa Farah, the White House director of strategic communications, said the deployment of active-duty military police is untrue. “False: off the record – title 10 not under discussion,” said Farah in an email response. No off-record agreement was negotiated with The Associated Press. The 16th Military Police Brigade forwarded the AP’s questions to the Defense Department. The three officials with direct knowledge of the potential deployment say the orders are on a classified system, known as the Secret Internet Protocol Router or SIPR for short. Active-duty forces are normally prohibited from acting as a domestic law enforcement agency. But the Insurrection Act offers an exception. The Act would allow the military to take up a policing authority it otherwise would not be allowed to do, enforcing state and federal laws, said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor who specializes in constitutional and national security law. The statute “is deliberately vague” when it comes to the instances in which the Insurrection Act could be used, he said. The state’s governor could ask President Donald Trump to take action or Trump could act on his own authority if he’s determined that the local authorities are so overwhelmed that they can’t adequately enforce the law, Vladeck said. “It is a very, very broad grant of authority for the president,” he added.

Joyce Beatty, Columbus City Council President Hardin pepper-sprayed during protest",https://www.wfxrtv.com/news/rep-joyce-beatty-columbus-city-council-president-hardin-pepper-sprayed-during-protest/,en,False,,576666,virginiafirst.com,http://virginiafirst.com/,"COLUMBUS (WCMH) — Columbus City Council President Shannon Hardin says he, Franklin County Commissioner Kevin Boyce and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty were sprayed with mace or pepper spray during a protest in downtown Columbus Saturday morning. Council President Hardin tweeted a video with Rep. Beatty saying that they are okay, and called on people on both sides of the protest to remain calm. Beatty said in an interview later Saturday that the pepper spray was “prolific.” “I don’t remember hearing anyone saying, ‘Move or we’re going to pepper spray,’” Beatty said. “Councilman Hardin got the brunt of it and he was in the middle of the sidewalk.” She added that she didn’t think the pepper spray was necessary. “I heard no warning,” she said. “Obviously if someone had said and held up a pepper spray and said, ‘I’m gonna pepper spray,’ we would have moved. Nobody wants to be pepper sprayed, trust me.” A spokesperson for Beatty told NBC4 that while the protest was underway, someone started scuffling with police. Police took that person down, which made other protesters angry. Beatty stepped in to try and calm the situation when police started spraying. Hardin and Boyce pulled Beatty out of the fray. “We understand that tensions are high. Our tensions are high as well. We are angry, and we need change. But the only way we will get change is by peaceful demonstrations,” said Hardin. “While it was peaceful, there were times where people got off the curb, into the street, said Beatty. “Too much force is not the answer this.” Beatty said Saturday’s protest was more peaceful than the protests on Friday night, when stores and businesses were damaged, saying she wanted to be there to support the organizers of Saturday’s protest. “I can tell you 95 percent of the folks were amazing,” Beatty said. She said that in the last 20 minutes she was in the area are when things began to take a turn with the arrival of police on bicycles. “Whatever happened last night, which I am totally against – breaking into buildings, marking up city hall – I am totally against that,” Beatty said. “But there was none of that today and I kept saying to the officers, ‘Do not excite them, do not excite them.’” Beatty added that a handful of protesters got off the sidewalks and into the streets, which is what prompted the police response. “Before we knew it, the bikes were going up against a young sister standing next to me,” she said. “A gentleman was knocked to the ground and then you know what happened. People start pushing and shoving. I got caught in the middle of it. Beatty said Hardin was pepper sprayed more than she was, adding Boyce was there and managed to get Beatty out of the way. Just want to let folks know that when @RepBeatty @VoteBoyce and I were down at the protest we did get sprayed with mace or pepper spray. We are all ok, and we want to encourage folks, both police and protestors, to stay calm. pic.twitter.com/RDQ1p4YDRY — Shannon Hardin (@SG_Hardin) May 30, 2020 Beatty said she came out to support those protesting injustice. “The message we want to have is we need to be in this together,” Beatty said. “We need to be fighting against the injustices, fighting against racism and tensions are high when you think about George Floyd, but when you are out there and you come in an antagonistic way, it only excites a riot.” She is asking protesters to stop “tearing up” the city and asking officers to stop antagonizing protesters, adding the officers were too aggressive toward excited protesters who were on the sidewalk who “may have had a toe off the sidewalk.” “I was there because I wanted the young protesters to know that in solidarity that I stand with them,” Beatty said. “You know, I’m a grandmother, I’m an elected official, but I’m a black woman first and I felt the pain. So I was there on the edge of the sidewalk when it all happened, wanting to support and feeling the need to protect this young sister. She was very vocal, but that’s freedom of speech. To push and shove and use a bicycle against her, I just think there could have been a better way.” Thanks to whoever gave me that milk. pic.twitter.com/q82XcPChaY — Shannon Hardin (@SG_Hardin) May 30, 2020 Hardin released the following statement Saturday night: “I’m angry and frustrated. Folks are being shot down while jogging and suffocating under the knee of injustice. Today, I saw with my own eyes that 99 percent of protesters were just trying to make their voices heard, while some individuals in the crowd were attempting to take advantage of the situation. I also saw police going too far, and that’s unacceptable. The people have spoken, and I hear you. The time for commissions and studies is over. The time to institute real police reform is now.  “Columbus needs to establish independent investigations into police use of force, including negotiating a Civilian Review Commission into the next police contract. Columbus needs to change the use of crowd dispersal techniques, as recommended by the Matrix report. And finally, Columbus needs to quickly move forward to implement the Community Safety Advisory Commission’s recommendations and the rest of the Matrix report.” The Matrix report is a review of Columbus law enforcement conducted by a team of consultants, employees of the Division of Police, city staff and the community working together since the winter of 2018-19. Beatty urged the protesters to recognize the difference between standing up to injustices and causing injustice. “If you’re going to be out there causing injustice and destroying property and looting and doing any of those things, that it is more destructive and that’s not the way we gain what we’re all in this for and that’s to bring justice,” she said. “I’ll be the first to stand with them, but we cannot tear up our own communities and our own buildings because that’s not going to accomplish anything.”",0.0

(WAVY) — Hundreds of people descended on Downtown Norfolk and Fort Monroe in Hampton Friday evening in protest of the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a Minneapolis Police officer earlier this week. Black Lives Matter 757 organized two gatherings in Hampton Roads Friday called “blackout757.” Both began at 7:57 p.m. One was at Fort Monroe in Hampton near the pavilion, and another was in Martin Luther King Jr. Monument Park and the surrounding area in Norfolk. The protests eventually moved to Interstate 64 around 9 p.m., when protesters shut down the lanes near Mallory Street in Hampton. The group went live on Facebook showing the Hampton location filled with people, many holding up their phones and signs. ABOVE: WAVY viewer video shows protesters in Downtown Norfolk. The signs read “Black Lives Matter and” “No justice, no peace, no police brutality.” A livestream on the Black Lives Matter 757 Facebook page showed protesters walking eastbound near the HRBT down the entrance ramp off Mallory Street. A tweet from 511 Hampton Roads around 9 p.m. said all eastbound lanes on Interstate 64 were blocked. Police confirmed an “incident” going eastbound shut down the tunnel. Both directions of traffic were released by 10:10 p.m. Protesters could be seen on the livestream shutting down the westbound lanes of the interstate as well. The protesters shut down the interstate for nearly nine minutes starting around 9 p.m. to represent how long Floyd went without air. During those nine minutes, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter” and “I can’t breathe” while standing among the stopped cars on I-64 near the Mallory Street exit. “I can’t breathe” were some of Floyd’s last words, which were captured on a widely-circulated video on the internet. After stopping traffic, protesters gathered on Mallory Street and chanted “No peace, no sleep” followed by a moment of silence remembering those who died at the hands of police, from suicide or from gun violence. After shutting down the interstate, protesters went to Peninsula Town Center to continue the protest. By 11:20 p.m., Hampton Police were playing a message on a loudspeaker around the intersection of Power Plant Way and Mercury Boulevard saying the gathering had been determined to be unlawful. Police asked the group to disperse. The road was also blocked to traffic. Some officers could be seen with shields and helmets. The crowd began to disperse around 12:30 a.m. Watch WAVY News Reporter Geena Arevalo as she reported live from the protest scene in Hampton Friday night.

(WFXR) — About 100 people gathered in front of the Lynchburg Community Market Saturday morning and marched to the police station to protest the death of George Floyd. “See us,” said Black Lives Matter protest organizer Mirgina Sheffey. “Hear us. Give us a voice.” “It’s all the recent black deaths,” she said, explaining why she organized the protest, “but on top of that, it’s just being in my skin every day. That’s like the greatest motivation.” She reflected on a video that shows George Floyd being killed in Minneapolis when a police officer kept his knee on Floyd’s neck. “Everybody waits until the videos come out, so that we can seek justice for the people, but black people live these lives every day,” she said. “It’s about time that people start appreciating that, like value life.” Lynchburg Resident Tameka Brown attended the protest and said it made her feel empowered.  “My heart’s been heavy,” she said. “Like, I grieve for the family of George Floyd and all the other victims, that this continues to keep happening. There’s no justice in what’s happening, and that we need to change it, and in order to do that, we have to keep speaking out.” Brown spoke in front of the crowd, urging unity.  “All of us, no matter if you’re black, you’re white, you’re gay, you’re straight, it doesn’t matter. We’re all in this together.” Tabitha Cawthorne, a Lynchburg resident, also spoke, saying, “I just think it’s so important for white people. This is not your job as a brown or Asian person to have to do this alone, because you didn’t ask for this.” Sheffey spoke about police brutality, saying, “It’s not all police, but the bad ones. The police that racism is ingrained in them.” As the protest was beginning, Lieutenant Luke Bryan approached Sheffey, giving her a statement from Police Chief Ryan Zuidema, which Zuidema released yesterday. Sheffey says Bryan told her to reach out to him if the protest “goes in a direction that you don’t feel comfortable with” and she needed help. “He was friendly,” said Sheffey, “and he let us know that he’s on our side. You know, he’s a human being, too. Take off the badge, take off the uniform. He’s a human being, and he validated us today. So, yeah.

Israeli police shot dead a Palestinian near Jerusalem's Old City who they had suspected was carrying a weapon but turned out to be unarmed. (AP Photo/Mahmoud Illean) JERUSALEM – Israeli police shot dead an unarmed autistic Palestinian man in Jerusalem's Old City on Saturday after saying they suspected he was carrying a weapon. The shooting drew broad condemnations and revived complaints alleging excessive force by Israeli security forces. On social media, some compared the shooting to police violence in the U.S. Relatives identified the deceased man as Iyad Halak, 32. They said he suffered from autism and was heading to the school for students with special needs where he studied each day when he was shot. “They killed him in cold blood,” Halak's mother, Rana, told Israel's Channel 12 TV. In a statement, Israeli police said they spotted a suspect “with a suspicious object that looked like a pistol.” When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire, the statement said. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld later said no weapon was found. Channel 12 said members of Israel's paramilitary border police force fired at Halak's legs and chased him into a dead-end alley. It said a senior officer ordered a halt in fire as they entered the alley, but that a second officer did not listen and fired six or seven bullets from an M-16 rifle, killing Halak. The report said both officers were taken into custody and interrogated for several hours. AP video from the scene showed three bullet holes in a white wall at the end of the alleyway. Halak's father, Kheiri, said police raided the family's home after the shooting. “They found nothing,” he said, claiming that police had cursed his daughter when she became upset at them. Lone Palestinian attackers with no clear links to armed groups have carried out a series of stabbings, shootings and car-ramming attacks in recent years. Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups have long accused Israeli security forces of using excessive force in some cases, either by killing individuals who could have been arrested or using lethal force when their lives were not in danger. “We must resist the expected cover-up and make sure that the police will sit in jail,” Ayman Odeh, the leader of the main Arab party in parliament, wrote on Twitter. “Justice will be done only when the Halak family, their friends and the rest of the Palestinian people know freedom and independence.” On social media, some pro-Palestinian activists compared the shooting to this week's killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black Minnesota man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck. His death has set off violent protests across the U.S. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, whose daughter is autistic, said Halak’s death was “heartbreaking.” “The death of a young person with special needs is heartbreaking and all of Israel bows their heads. This is not our way,” he tweeted. In west Jerusalem, about 150 protesters, some pounding drums, gathered to demonstrate against police violence. “A violent policeman must stay inside,” they chanted in Hebrew. At a smaller protest in Tel Aviv, one poster read “Palestinian lives matter."" The shooting came a day after Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank who they said had tried to ram them with his vehicle. No Israelis were wounded in either incident. Saturday’s shooting occurred in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 war along with the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Tensions have risen in recent weeks as Israel has pressed ahead with plans to annex large parts of the West Bank in line with President Donald Trump's Middle East plan, which strongly favors Israel and was rejected by the Palestinians. Netanyahu has said he plans on moving ahead with the plan in July. The Palestinian Authority, which governs autonomous enclaves in the West Bank, said last week that it was no longer bound by past agreements with Israel and the United States and was cutting off all ties, including longstanding security coordination, to protest the annexation plan. The Trump plan would allow the Palestinians to establish a capital on the outskirts of the city, beyond Israel's separation barrier. It would grant them limited statehood in a cluster of enclaves surrounded by Israel, but only if they meet a long list of stringent conditions. The annexation plan has also drawn widespread condemnations from Israeli allies in Europe and across the Arab world.",0.0

The protest in Tucson was similar to those in numerous cities across the United States following George Floyd's death while in custody of the Minneapolis police on Memorial Day in Minnesota. (Josh Galemore/Arizona Daily Star via AP) LOS ANGELES – On two straight nights of unruly protests against police brutality, officers retreated from their posts in some American cities, while in others, they deployed batons, flash-bang grenades and tear gas to quell the unrest. The wide range of responses exacerbated tensions with the protesters in several locations and brought global attention to the tactics that American police use during riots as they try to find a balance between keeping the peace and protecting the safety of officers and the public. The protests came in the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee into the 46-year-old black man's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day. Floyd was handcuffed as Officer Derek Chauvin pushed his face into the pavement amid his pleas for help. Tensions rose throughout the week and reached a crescendo Friday night as protests erupted in cities across America. On their smart phones, social media feeds and TVs, viewers saw the extremes in tactics play out all through the night Thursday and Friday, even as the majority of cops nationwide tried to keep the peace without retreating or shoving people to the ground. In Minneapolis, leaders decided to evacuate a police precinct Thursday and surrender it to protesters who set it on fire. Protesters also broke into the police headquarters Friday in Portland, Oregon, and ignited a fire. In New York, officers used batons and shoved protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared the streets. One video showed an officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. In Louisville, a police officer fired what appeared to be pepper balls at a news crew, and a clip of the video amassed more than 8 million views on Twitter in less than six hours. Los Angeles police arrested more than 500 protesters on Friday night. Minneapolis police and Mayor Jacob Frey have been sharply criticized for the noticeably non-confrontational strategy Thursday in handling the protests after Floyd’s death. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with murder. To some, the act of protesters taking over the evacuated Minneapolis precinct amid fires could stoke further flames. “You’ve got to defend that,” said former Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Michael Downing. “That’s your command operation. Symbolically, it looks very bad if you have to give that up.” Downing would know: He witnessed the Los Angeles riots firsthand in 1992 following the acquittal of four officers accused of beating black motorist Rodney King. In Los Angeles, the center of the uprising was an intersection, Florence and Normandie avenues, and the violence spiraled into five days of riots and fires. More than 60 people died, including 10 who were fatally shot by law enforcement. In 1992, then-Lt. Downing would typically oversee that intersection, but he was on vacation studying for a promotional exam. A different lieutenant was in charge instead. The lieutenant made a decision: He ordered his officers to abandon the intersection. An hour later, a truck driver was pulled from his vehicle and brutally beaten by rioters. “I think that sent a signal to the rest of the city,” said Downing, who immediately rushed to work. “When you have that coupled with political leadership saying ‘show your anger, go to the streets’ it was kind of like permission to go out and misbehave and be violent.” Nearly 30 years later, police officers around the country are confronted with an eerily similar dilemma, with cities aflame, violent protests erupting and another challenging night ahead Saturday as National Guard troops start arriving in some cities. The mere presence of armed National Guard troops on the streets in Minneapolis and elsewhere brings back memories of the civil rights and anti-war protests of the 1960s and '70s, but they are only there as a support to local law enforcement and do not have the authority to make arrests. They can use their weapons in “self defense” but are trained in less lethal crowd control tactics that attempt to de-escalate tensions, unlike the combat techniques that have largely been abandoned since the Kent State University shootings in Ohio in 1970 when the state’s National Guard killed four students and wounded nine. Alex Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College, said that when deciding how to manage large protests, police and political leaders look for ways to facilitate “legitimate outpourings of anger” while trying to limit the likelihood of injury and property destruction. But he said the difficulty is trying to strike that balance. “The crisis of police legitimacy has become so great that then to use the police to manage the situation just enflames the problem,” said Vitale, who has studied the policing of protests for two decades. In Minneapolis and other cities around the nation where high-profile police killings of black people have prompted protests, the rage felt by protesters is understandable, said Ed Gonzalez, sheriff of Harris County, Texas. “We keep promising real change but not delivering it on a consistent basis,” he said. “We see the resulting emotions and anger and calls for change that occur, only for it to happen again.” Edward Maguire, a criminology and criminal justice professor at Arizona State University whose research focuses primarily on policing and violence, said mass arrests are almost always a bad idea during protests. But so is not making arrests in the face of violence and property damage. He said police departments should be continuously engaged in building connections with minority communities, faith representatives and social justice leaders so that they have a degree of social capital and open communications when protests break out. In other recent protests, police found themselves in a similar situation as those on the front lines this week. Police were criticized in Baltimore and Charlottesville, Virginia, for taking too much of a hands-off approach during protests in 2015 and 2017. In Minneapolis, Frey said he made the decision to evacuate the third precinct that was later torched because of “imminent threats” to both officers and the public. “Brick and mortar is not as important as life,” Frey said. Even as law enforcement nationwide harshly condemned Chauvin's actions in unprecedented language earlier in the week, they denounced the violence of the fiery protests and pleaded for calm. “You can’t allow anarchy just because this horrible injustice has occurred,” said Stephen Downing, Michael Downing’s father and also a retired LAPD deputy chief. “You can’t let your city burn. You just can’t.” ___ AP writer Sarah Rankin contributed to this report from Richmond, Virginia.",0.0

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A rocket ship built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company thundered away from Earth with two Americans on Saturday, ushering in a new era in commercial space travel and putting the United States back in the business of launching astronauts into orbit from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade. NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send Apollo crews to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they slipped safely into orbit. “Let's light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the words used by Alan Shepard on America's first human spaceflight, in 1961. The two men are scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth, on Sunday for a stay of up to four months, after which they will come home with a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would be a morale-booster. “Maybe there’s an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said before launch. With the on-time liftoff by the 260-foot rocket, SpaceX, founded by Musk, the Tesla electric-car visionary, became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA, the longest such hiatus in its history. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. In the intervening years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. Musk said earlier in the week that the project is aimed at “reigniting the dream of space and getting people fired up about the future.” Ultimately, NASA hopes to rely in part on its commercial partners as it works to send astronauts back to the moon in the next few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. A launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather in Florida threatened another postponement for most of the day, but then the skies began to clear in the afternoon just in time. Before setting out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV — another Musk product — Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket's first-stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast, to be reused on another flight. “Thanks for the great ride to space,” Hurley told SpaceX ground control. His crewmate batted around a sparkly purplish toy, demonstrating that they had reached zero gravity. SpaceX controllers at Hawthorne, California, cheered and applauded wildly. Bridenstine pronounced it “just an amazing day.” “It’s been nine years since we’ve launched American astronauts on American rockets from American soil — and now it’s done. We have done it. It’s been way too long,” he said. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence flew in for the launch attempt for the second time in four days. “I’m so proud of the people at NASA, all the people that worked together, public and private. When you see a sight like that it’s incredible,” Trump said after liftoff. Inside Kennedy Space Center, attendance was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the small crowd of a few thousand was a shadow of what it would have been without the threat of COVID-19. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators gathered along beaches and roads hours in advance. Among them was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville. “It’s pretty historically significant in my book, and a lot of other people’s books. With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” Wight said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” Because of the coronavirus, the astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months before liftoff. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And at the launch center, the SpaceX controllers wore masks and were seated far apart. Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Hurley piloted the shuttle on the last launch of astronauts from Kennedy, on July 8, 2011. In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. In preparation for Saturday's flight, SpaceX sent up a Dragon capsule with only a test dummy aboard last year, and it docked smoothly at the orbiting outpost on autopilot, then returned to Earth in a splashdown. During the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and shuttle programs, NASA relied on aerospace contractors to build spacecraft according to the agency’s designs. NASA owned and operated the ships. Under the new, 21st-century partnership, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate the spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) “What Elon Musk has done for the American space program is he has brought vision and inspiration that we hadn’t had” since the shuttle’s retirement, Bridenstine said. The mission is technically considered by SpaceX and NASA to be a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. Saturday's first human flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But the project encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks.",0.0

Veteran astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are making the historic trip. At one point, weather threatened Saturday’s launch just as it did Wednesday when the countdown of the rocket and its bullet-shaped Dragon capsule was halted at just under 17 minutes because of the threat of lightning. President Donald Trump attended Saturday’s launch. NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 to taxi astronauts to and from the space station, under contracts totaling $7 billion. Both companies launched their crew capsules last year with test dummies. SpaceX’s Dragon aced all of its objectives, while Boeing’s Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was almost destroyed because of software errors. As a result, the first Starliner flight carrying astronauts isn’t expected until next year.

1621106758,2020-05-30 14:47:00,Minnesota To Deploy Record Guard Force To Contain Unrest Over Death Of George Floyd,https://www.wmra.org/post/minnesota-deploy-record-guard-force-contain-unrest-over-death-george-floyd,en,False,,144825,wmra.org,http://wmra.org/,"Updated at 4:41 p.m. ET Faced with a fourth straight night of massive protests over the death of George Floyd, Minnesota on Friday deployed its largest law enforcement operation in state history, including more than 700 members of the National Guard. ""It was not enough,"" Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — ""an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,"" according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. ""We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,"" the governor said Saturday. ""But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life."" The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd's death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order ""to help keep peace in Louisville."" ""I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,"" Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. ""But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe."" President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd's memory is for authorities to ""get tougher"" on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called ""radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can't do this."" ""They've got to be tough, they've got to be smart,"" Trump said of state officials. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military."" In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump's comments, saying that though the outrage is ""real and legitimate,"" the protests are ""being hijacked by violent radical elements."" ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,"" Barr said. ""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.""

Also termed “the meat rack” by some, the Block was a late-night outdoor gay cruising spot that shifted its location over the years in an attempt to avoid police interference. This “out in the open” pick-up site complemented various other meeting places that catered to LGBTQ+ nightlife at the time, including bars like Eton’s, Marroni’s and Renee’s. This is some of the seldom documented LGBTQ+ history that the Richmond’s Pride Ride hopes to highlight this year. Unlike last year’s Pride Ride, which featured a group cycling tour around the city that culminated in a cookout, the second annual event is a DIY affair in light of the pandemic. Through maps that can be found online or in a zine format, cyclists can tour the city independently to learn about Richmond’s LGBTQ+ history. A limited number of maps will be distributed at 10 Little Free Libraries around town in a zine format. Cosponsored by Women Trans Femme Ride RVA, Rag & Bones Bicycle Co-op and cycling initiative VCU RamBikes, the map was researched and created by Alexa Santisteban, Sera Erickson and Elise Ketch. The idea for a map of historical sites came about as a way to celebrate Richmond’s LGBTQ+ community while still practicing social distancing during the pandemic. “We thought, ‘How can we still send people on a Pride Ride by themselves?’ and thought that it would be cool to investigate some of the history surrounding the LGBTQ movement in Richmond,” says Erickson, a longtime mechanic and organizer with Rag & Bones and bicycle program coordinator for VCU RamBikes. “This kind of starts in 1969, the same year as the Stonewall riots.” Through research pulled from Beth Marschak and Alex Lorch’s 2008 book “Lesbian and Gay Richmond,” the website OutHistory.org and other sources, Santisteban chose 20 locations to highlight north of the James River. “[There were] a lot of interesting sites that I didn’t expect to find, because it’s not as accessible,” says Santisteban, a mechanic who helps with programming with VCU RamBikes. “There’s not a lot of written history about the community here in Richmond, and so it was really interesting to go through and find some of these locations.” In March of 1969, months before the Stonewall Riots in Greenwich Village that would foment the gay liberation movement, Richmond experienced a crackdown of its LGBTQ+-friendly bars, with the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control revoking the beer and wine licenses of Renee’s at the Capitol Hotel and the Rathskeller in Carytown for serving gays, according to Marschak and Lorch’s book. These closures led to the first open protest of anti-gay action in Richmond. Later organizing efforts, such as the formation of groups like Lesbian Womyn of Color, Richmond Lesbian Feminists, Richmond Black Pride and the Gay Alliance of Students are also included on the map. Other points of interest include cultural sites like Diversity Richmond, Richmond Triangle Players and the now-defunct early lesbian bookstore Labrys Books on North Allen Avenue. Santisteban says it was enlightening to see where events from Richmond’s LGBTQ+ past had taken place around the city. “I didn’t know that I was walking by buildings where history had happened so many years ago,” they say. As a queer transgender person of color, Santisteban was especially intrigued to learn about the formation of Lesbian Womyn of Color in 1993. The group began as a social, political and cultural organization to address the needs of lesbians of color. “Knowing that they existed was a really cool piece of history that I wasn’t expecting to find,” they say. “That’s one of the spots that I was really excited to put on the map.” More than anything, Santisteban hopes the map and the Pride Ride get people interested in the city’s often neglected LGBTQ+ past. “Hopefully this can lead to more efforts to have more written history about what has happened here in Richmond,” they say. “We hope that people document their rides and share it with us, because we definitely want to see people enjoying it.” The map for Richmond’s 2020 Pride Ride can be found at tinyurl.com/rvaprideride.",0.0

The wide range of responses exacerbated tensions with the protesters in several locations and brought global attention to the tactics that American police use during riots as they try to find a balance between keeping the peace and protecting the safety of officers and the public. The protests came in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee into the 46-year-old black man’s neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day. Floyd was handcuffed as Officer Derek Chauvin pushed his face into the pavement amid his pleas for help. Tensions rose throughout the week and reached a crescendo Friday night as protests erupted in cities across America. On their smart phones, social media feeds and TVs, viewers saw the extremes in tactics play out all through the night Thursday and Friday, even as the majority of cops nationwide tried to keep the peace without retreating or shoving people to the ground. In Minneapolis, leaders decided to evacuate a police precinct Thursday and surrender it to protesters who set it on fire. Protesters also broke into the police headquarters Friday in Portland, Oregon, and ignited a fire. In New York, officers used batons and shoved protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared the streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. In Louisville, a police officer fired what appeared to be pepper balls at a news crew, and a clip of the video amassed more than 8 million views on Twitter in less than six hours. Los Angeles police arrested more than 500 protesters on Friday night. Minneapolis police and Mayor Jacob Frey have been sharply criticized for the noticeably non-confrontational strategy Thursday in handling the protests after Floyd’s death. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with murder. To some, the act of protesters taking over the evacuated Minneapolis precinct amid fires could stoke further flames. “You’ve got to defend that,” said former Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Michael Downing. “That’s your command operation. Symbolically, it looks very bad if you have to give that up.” Downing would know: He witnessed the Los Angeles riots firsthand in 1992 following the acquittal of four officers accused of beating black motorist Rodney King. In Los Angeles, the center of the uprising was an intersection, Florence and Normandie avenues, and the violence spiraled into five days of riots and fires. More than 60 people died, including 10 who were fatally shot by law enforcement. In 1992, then-Lt. Downing would typically oversee that intersection, but he was on vacation studying for a promotional exam. A different lieutenant was in charge instead. The lieutenant made a decision: He ordered his officers to abandon the intersection. An hour later, a truck driver would be pulled from his vehicle and be brutally beaten by rioters. “I think that sent a signal to the rest of the city,” said Downing, who immediately rushed to work. “When you have that coupled with political leadership saying ‘show your anger, go to the streets’ it was kind of like permission to go out and misbehave and be violent.” Nearly 30 years later, police officers around the country are confronted with an eerily similar dilemma, with cities aflame, violent protests erupting and another challenging night ahead Saturday as National Guard troops start arriving in some cities. Alex Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College, said that when deciding how to manage large protests, police and political leaders look for ways to facilitate “legitimate outpourings of anger” while trying to limit the likelihood of injury and property destruction. But he said the difficulty is trying to strike that balance. “The crisis of police legitimacy has become so great that then to use the police to manage the situation just enflames the problem,” said Vitale, who has studied the policing of protests for two decades. In Minneapolis and other cities around the nation where high-profile police killings of black people have prompted protests, the rage felt by protesters is understandable, said Ed Gonzalez, sheriff of Harris County, Texas. “We keep promising real change but not delivering it on a consistent basis,” he said. “We see the resulting emotions and anger and calls for change that occur, only for it to happen again.” Edward Maguire, a criminology and criminal justice professor at Arizona State University whose research focuses primarily on policing and violence, said mass arrests are almost always a bad idea during protests. But so is not making arrests in the face of violence and property damage. He said police departments should be continuously engaged in building connections with minority communities, faith representatives and social justices leaders so that they have a degree of social capital and open communications when protests break out. In other recent protests, police found themselves in a similar situation as those on the front lines this week. Police were criticized in Baltimore and Charlottesville, Virginia, for taking too much of a hands-off approach during protests in 2015 and 2017. In Minneapolis, Frey said he made the decision to evacuate the third precinct that was later torched because of “imminent threats” to both officers and the public. “Brick and mortar is not as important as life,” Frey said. Even as law enforcement nationwide harshly condemned Chauvin’s actions in unprecedented language earlier in the week, they denounced the violence of the fiery protests and pleaded for calm. “You can’t allow anarchy just because this horrible injustice has occurred,” said Stephen Downing, Michael Downing’s father and also a retired LAPD deputy chief. “You can’t let your city burn. You just can’t.” ___ AP writer Sarah Rankin contributed to this report from Richmond, Virginia. Latest News",0.0
1621118697,2020-05-30 15:38:33,"Cities brace for increasing unrest, call in National Guard",https://www.wavy.com/news/national/cities-brace-for-increasing-unrest-call-in-national-guard/,en,True,,70270,wavy.com,http://www.wavy.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Protesters set police cars ablaze, smashed businesses’ windows and skirmished with baton-wielding officers in streets from Atlanta to Los Angeles, as anger over George Floyd’s death spread across the country. Authorities were bracing for more violence Saturday, with some calling in the National Guard to beef up overwhelmed forces. In Minneapolis, the city where Floyd died Monday after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck and kept it there for more than eight minutes, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” On Friday alone, more than two dozen cities — from New York to Oakland, California, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon — experienced protests, many peaceful but some of which turned violent. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. President Donald Trump did little to tamp down the anger, firing off a series of tweets ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would … have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. The arrest and charging of the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck on Friday appears to have provided little balm. Georgia’s governor, meanwhile, declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler also declared an emergency and ordered a nighttime curfew for the city. The Guard was also on standby in the District of Columbia. Some protesters tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue, and threw bottles and other objects at officers wearing riot gear, who responded with pepper spray. “I just feel like he’s just one of many names that we’ve had to create hashtags and T-shirts and campaigns for and I feel like nothing has changed,” district resident Abe Neri said of Floyd. “And so that’s why I’m out here. Yeah, when you say nothing you’re taking the side of the oppressor.” A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. In Portland, Oregon, protesters broke into police headquarters and authorities said they lit a fire inside. In Virginia’s capital, a police cruiser was set on fire outside Richmond police headquarters, and a city transit spokeswoman said a bus set ablaze was “a total loss,” news outlets reported. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp tweeted that up to 500 members of the Guard would deploy immediately “to protect people & property in Atlanta.” He said he acted at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who earlier appealed in vain for calm. In scenes both peaceful and violent across the nation, thousands of protesters chanted “No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” They hoisted signs reading: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” Some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters in downtown Atlanta. At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said, as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at Del Frisco’s restaurant in the Buckhead neighborhood several miles north because of protesters there. “This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr.,” Bottoms said. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Bottoms was flanked by King’s daughter, Bernice King, and rappers T.I. and Killer Mike. “We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” said Killer Mike, crying as he spoke. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, scrawled graffiti across its charred body and set it aflame again as officers retreated. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. “There will be a full review of what happened tonight,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted, referring to the Brooklyn protest. “We don’t ever want to see another night like this.” The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one whose tooth was knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Protesters in Houston, where Floyd grew up, included 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas: “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” Demonstrators on the West Coast blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland, California. About 1,000 protesters in Oakland smashed windows, sprayed buildings with “Kill Cops” graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police, who said several officers were injured by projectiles. One Los Angeles officer received medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and at least one city bus was vandalized. Police declared an unlawful assembly throughout downtown, where aerial footage from KTLA-TV showed scored of people corralled by police. An LAPD spokesman told The Associated Press they were still tallying arrests. Portland, Oregon, police said at least one shooting was tied to the protest, although details weren’t immediately released. Mayor Wheeler tweeted a plea to protesters to remain peaceful and said that, while he had left the city to attend to his dying mother, he was heading back. He later declared a state of emergency. “Portland, this is not us,” he wrote. “When you destroy our city, you are destroying our community. When you act in violence against each other, you are hurting all of us. How does this honor the legacy of George Floyd?” Latest News",0.0

(Nicole Hester/Mlive.com/Ann Arbor News via AP) DETROIT (AP) — One person was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes, a Detroit police spokeswoman said Saturday. The shooting occurred about 11:30 p.m. Friday near Detroit’s Greektown entertainment district as officers were confronted with dozens of protesters, said Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood, a police spokeswoman. She said an officer wasn’t involved in the shooting. A police report released Saturday said the shooting victim, a 21-year-old man, was sitting in the driver’s seat of a silver Dodge Caliber in a parking lot with two other male occupants when an unknown person fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot. Police earlier said that based on preliminary information, the shooting suspect had pulled up in a Dodge Durango and fired shots into a crowd. Kirkwood said the victim was pronounced dead at a hospital and that police were still investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting. Police made more than 60 arrests during Friday’s protest. The majority of those arrested live in Detroit’s suburbs and not the city itself, Kirkwood said. “We know that the individuals from outside the city of Detroit who converged at the protest location don’t represent this city,” Police Chief James Craig told reporters Friday evening. The demonstration began earlier in the day and was peaceful as protesters marched by Detroit Police Headquarters. As evening wore on, some in the crowd became belligerent and a police commander was struck with a rock Friday evening and hospitalized. Officers, many in riot gear, confronted the demonstrators and formed lines across streets during the demonstration, but by midnight, the crowd had thinned considerably as police shot canisters of gas toward the protesters. The violence in Detroit and many other cities was sparked by anger over over Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on Monday, which was captured on cellphone video. It led to the firing Tuesday of the four police officers who were arresting Floyd on for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill and to third-degree murder and manslaughter charges being filed Friday against the officer who used his knee to pin Floyd down by his neck for more than eight minutes, even as Floyd pleaded for air and went limp. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said Saturday in a statement that “an overwhelming number of people were engaged in peaceful protest” during Friday’s protests over Floyd’s death — a death which she said “has profoundly affected our nation.” Worthy said that while peaceful protests over Floyd’s death are “absolutely warranted,” acts of violence are not. And she urged protesters to engage in “safe, peaceful and civil protest of his murder.” “The point of protesting what happened to Mr. Floyd can be lost when violence becomes the narrative of the protest,” she said.

Veteran astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are making the historic trip. At one point, weather threatened Saturday’s launch just as it did Wednesday when the countdown of the rocket and its bullet-shaped Dragon capsule was halted at just under 17 minutes because of the threat of lightning. President Donald Trump attended Saturday’s launch. NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 to taxi astronauts to and from the space station, under contracts totaling $7 billion. Both companies launched their crew capsules last year with test dummies. SpaceX’s Dragon aced all of its objectives, while Boeing’s Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was almost destroyed because of software errors. As a result, the first Starliner flight carrying astronauts isn’t expected until next year. (The Associated Press contributed to this report)",0.0

(WFXR) — About 100 people gathered in front of the Lynchburg Community Market Saturday morning and marched to the police station to protest the death of George Floyd. “See us,” said Black Lives Matter protest organizer Mirgina Sheffey. “Hear us. Give us a voice.” “It’s all the recent black deaths,” she said, explaining why she organized the protest, “but on top of that, it’s just being in my skin every day. That’s like the greatest motivation.” She reflected on a video that shows George Floyd being killed in Minneapolis when a police officer kept his knee on Floyd’s neck. “Everybody waits until the videos come out, so that we can seek justice for the people, but black people live these lives every day,” she said. “It’s about time that people start appreciating that, like value life.” Lynchburg Resident Tameka Brown attended the protest and said it made her feel empowered.  “My heart’s been heavy,” she said. “Like, I grieve for the family of George Floyd and all the other victims, that this continues to keep happening. There’s no justice in what’s happening, and that we need to change it, and in order to do that, we have to keep speaking out.” Brown spoke in front of the crowd, urging unity.  “All of us, no matter if you’re black, you’re white, you’re gay, you’re straight, it doesn’t matter. We’re all in this together.” Tabitha Cawthorne, a Lynchburg resident, also spoke, saying, “I just think it’s so important for white people. This is not your job as a brown or Asian person to have to do this alone, because you didn’t ask for this.” Sheffey spoke about police brutality, saying, “It’s not all police, but the bad ones. The police that racism is ingrained in them.” As the protest was beginning, Lieutenant Luke Bryan approached Sheffey, giving her a statement from Police Chief Ryan Zuidema, which Zuidema released yesterday. Sheffey says Bryan told her to reach out to him if the protest “goes in a direction that you don’t feel comfortable with” and she needed help. “He was friendly,” said Sheffey, “and he let us know that he’s on our side. You know, he’s a human being, too. Take off the badge, take off the uniform. He’s a human being, and he validated us today. So, yeah. I appreciate him.” Group of protesters gather in Downtown Lynchburg About 100 #BlackLivesMatter protestors marching through #Lynchburg.

Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Fires burned unchecked and thousands protesting the police killing of George Floyd ignored a curfew as unrest overwhelmed authorities for another night in Minneapolis, and the governor acknowledged Saturday that he didn’t have enough manpower to contain the chaos. The new round of tumult — which has also spread to other cities — came despite Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz vowing Friday to show a more forceful response than city leaders had the day before. But by early Saturday morning, Walz said he didn’t have enough troops, even with some 500 National Guardsmen. “We do not have the numbers,” Walz said. “We cannot arrest people when we are trying to hold ground.” Walz said he was moving quickly to mobilize more than 1,000 more Guard members, for a total of 1,700, and was considering the potential offer of federal military police. But he warned that even that might not be enough, saying he expected another difficult night Saturday. The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to the city on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The rare step came as the violence spread to other cities: A man shot dead in Detroit, police cars battered in Atlanta and skirmishes with police in New York City. Criminal charges filed Friday morning against the white officer who held his knee for nearly nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed at the time, did nothing to stem the anger. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Minneapolis police said shots had been fired at law enforcement officers during the protests but no one was injured. As the night dragged on, fires erupted across the city’s south side, including at a Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank and an Office Depot. Many burned for hours, with firefighters again delayed in reaching them because areas weren’t secure. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence, one day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. On Thursday, protesters had torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and went on to burn or vandalize dozens of businesses. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association urged Gov. Walz to accept any help. “You need more resources,” the group said in a tweet. “Law enforcement needs leadership.” Not all the protests were violent. Downtown, thousands of demonstrators encircled a barricaded police station after the 8 p.m. Friday curfew. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” Some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. Anger filled the streets of Minneapolis. Ben Hubert, a 26-year-old local resident, said he wasn’t surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. “I’m outraged,” he said of the Floyd case. “But I’m also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It’s been swelling for years.” Chauvin was also accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he pleaded that he could not breathe, while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case four days after Floyd’s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. Trump said Friday that he’d spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow.” He called video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City. He was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd’s death. Latest News",0.0

(WAVY) — Four individuals, including two adults and two juveniles, were arrested after protesters descended in Fort Monroe in Hampton Friday evening in protest of the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by a Minneapolis Police officer earlier this week. Black Lives Matter 757 organized two gatherings in Hampton Roads Friday called “blackout757.” The demonstration began at approximately 7:57 p.m. and the crowd moved on foot along the seawall at Fort Monroe to the gazebo. Police say the crowd eventually dispersed from the interstate but reconvened in the area of Peninsula Town Center. After marching through the streets of the Peninsula Town Center, the group made its way onto Cunningham Drive, and eventually onto W. Mercury Boulevard near the Interstate 64 interchange around 9 p.m. Their signs read “Black Lives Matter” and “No justice, no peace, no police brutality.” A livestream on the Black Lives Matter 757 Facebook page showed protesters walking eastbound near the HRBT down the entrance ramp off Mallory Street. Before the protest, Hampton Police say they reached out to the organizers prior to the event to make sure the planned demonstrations would be safe and peaceful. According to reports, the crowd split into two groups. One group comprised of Black Lives Matter 757 coordinators made its way back to the Peninsula Town Center and dispersed peacefully. The second group remained in the area of W. Mercury Boulevard. That crowd confronted officers in the Lidl parking lot who went to that area for security, and the police say demonstrators physically blocked traffic in both directions on W. Mercury Boulevard. That group was instructed to disperse, however, the crowd refused to comply and some began to throw items at officers on the scene, police say. Four individuals, including two adults and two juveniles, were arrested for charges including assault on law enforcement and disorderly conduct. The situation was resolved just before 2:30 a.m. Hampton Police say that although they support the demonstrators’ right to peacefully protest, demonstrations that insight violence and mayhem “cannot and will not be tolerated.” Protestors have gathered again at Peninsula Town Center. @WAVY_News pic.twitter.com/xzDiL9Rh1Q — Geena Arevalo (@GeenaA_WAVY) May 30, 2020 Latest Posts",0.0

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) ATLANTA – When the United States erupted in unrest following Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in 1968, his hometown of Atlanta was one of the few major cities to maintain relative peace. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms invoked that history in a passionate and deeply personal plea for protesters to go home. “When Dr. King was assassinated, we didn't do this to our city,” Bottoms said Friday night. “If you care about this city, then go home.” The protests are quickly becoming a high-stakes leadership test for Bottoms just as her national profile is rising. She is under consideration to be presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s running mate — and even if she isn’t tapped for that role, many Democrats view Bottoms as a rising star within the party. Protests in Atlanta over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white officer in Minneapolis pressed a knee into his neck, turned violent before Bottoms spoke. Police cars were smashed and CNN’s headquarters was vandalized as protests shook a city that prides itself as the birthplace of the civil rights movement. Bottoms addressed the crowds both as a mayor and a mother. “I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old,” Bottoms said. “When I saw the murder of George Floyd, I hurt like a mother.” When she heard of the potential of protests, Bottoms said she called her son to find out where he was. “I said, ’I cannot protect you and black boys shouldn’t be out today,'"" she said. Her message to protesters: “You’re not going to out-concern me ... about where we are in America. I wear this each and every day.” Bottoms’ remarks were widely praised. TJ Ducklo, the Biden campaign's national press secretary, said the presumptive nominee “has been grateful for Mayor Bottoms’ support and counsel since the earliest days of our campaign.” ""Her passion, her empathy and her strong and steady leadership are shining through during this difficult moment, and the city of Atlanta is lucky to have her leading the way,” Ducklo said. Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, a conservative Republican ally of President Donald Trump, tweeted that the mayor had issued a “strong” statement. The 50-year-old Bottoms was elected mayor in 2017 and previously served on the City Council. During a recent interview with The Associated Press before the protest, she spoke of Atlanta as a ""special place where people of color are able to break traditional molds and change the landscape of who we are as a country.” Until now, her national profile among Democrats has been eclipsed by fellow Georgian Stacey Abrams, the voting-rights activist who narrowly lost her bid in 2018 to become America's first black female governor. But Bottoms has engaged in national issues during her time in City Hall. She was among the big-city mayors to blast Trump’s immigration policies, and she ended the city jail’s contract with federal immigration enforcement. She’s leading the U.S. Conference of Mayors’ efforts on the census and housing policy. Bottoms was one of Biden's earliest endorsers, providing backing that was helpful at a time when the Democratic field included dozens of candidates who spanned generations, genders and races. She was a precinct captain in overwhelmingly white Iowa, where Biden finished an embarrassing fourth, before going on to the Southern states that reversed his fortunes and helped him become the presumptive nominee. Biden has pledged to pick a woman as his running mate and is under growing pressure following Floyd's death to make sure that selection is a black woman. Beyond Bottoms, he's believed to be considering Abrams, California Sen. Kamala Harris and Florida Rep. Val Demings. Several white women are also contenders, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. The prospect of another white vice presidential hopeful, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, may fade given her time as a prosecutor in the county that includes Minneapolis. South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn told reporters on Friday that this is “very tough timing for her.” Clyburn, whose endorsement of Biden was crucial to his commanding victory in the South Carolina primary, has spoken positively of Bottoms. Asked during the AP interview what she'd bring to the ticket with Biden, Bottoms, a former judge and City Council member, noted that she’s served in each branch of government, with her executive tenure overlapping with a massive cyberattack on city government’s technology infrastructure and now the coronavirus pandemic. “You’ve got to have proven leadership that’s been tested in the midst of crisis,” she said. ___ Sloan reported from Washington.

1621150964,2020-05-30 17:28:22,"Before Floyd death, activists saw progress on police reforms",https://www.wavy.com/news/national/before-floyd-death-activists-saw-progress-on-police-reforms/,en,True,,70270,wavy.com,http://www.wavy.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Years of dialogue about police and criminal justice reforms in Minneapolis had improved the relationship between the African American community and law enforcement, activists say — before the police killing this week of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes as he pleaded for air. Floyd’s death and footage of the officer pressing a knee into his neck for several minutes have unleashed protests and violent clashes with law enforcement — exposing simmering frustration and the fact that there’s much work still ahead, several advocates and leaders told The Associated Press. “Progress and change can ebb and flow,” said Jeremiah Ellison, who won a City Council seat after participating in past protests against police killings of African Americans in Minnesota. The four nights of unrest this week — including the torching of a police station that officers abandoned — “proved to me that we’ve regressed to the point of 2015,” Ellison said, referring to the year that also saw protests after the death of Jamar Clark, a black man killed by police. Minneapolis — a city of nearly 430,000 that is 60% white, 19% black and 9% Hispanic — has a long history of economic and educational disparities that have marginalized black residents for decades, despite its reputation for progressive values. It is one of the most segregated cities in the country for its size, and schools suffer from stubborn achievement gaps. The city appointed its first black chief of police nearly three years ago, after slow progress toward making the department more inclusive. Earlier this year, a statewide task force made up of activists, people representing victims of police brutality, and law enforcement leaders released recommendations for policing reforms. That task force was formed in the wake of several high-profile fatal shootings of black men by police in the Minneapolis area. Those included Clark, who was killed during a struggle with two white Minneapolis officers, and Philando Castile, who was fatally shot by a Hispanic suburban police officer during a traffic stop in 2016. While Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and former president of the Minneapolis NAACP, acknowledges that progress, she said that many old habits are still entrenched. “The system itself has not changed,” Armstrong said. “The culture within the Minneapolis Police Department has not changed.” The city’s police department of more than 800 officers is still predominantly white, she said. The department did not respond to a request for up-to-date figures, but the Star Tribune reported in 2014 that the force, including cadets in field training, was 78.9% white, 9.2% black, 5.2% Asian, 4.1% Hispanic and 2.5% American Indian. Some leaders, including former Mayor R.T. Rybak and state Sen. Jeff Hayden, have blamed the city’s police union in recent days for fostering a culture that protects brutal officers and resists efforts at reform. The union’s president, Lt. Bob Kroll, did not return a call seeking comment. The eruption of anger in Minneapolis reflects frustration over these realities, despite some progress, said Teqen Zéa-Aida, a longtime activist in the city. But the images themselves also demanded a “public response,” he said, though he pushed for protests to happen online given the risks of gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. “We saw his eyes … we saw a lynching. George Floyd is Emmett Till, 2020,” he said, referring to the black 14-year-old who was abducted, beaten and killed in 1955 after he was accused of whistling at a white woman in Mississippi, a lynching that helped spur the civil rights movement. Bystander video and photos of the arrest showed Floyd on the ground, while Officer Derek Chauvin kneels on his neck, ignoring his pleas for help. Two other officers appear to help hold him down, and a fourth attempts to keep space around the scene. “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts … I can’t breathe,” said Floyd, who eventually becomes motionless. Police initially said they arrested Floyd because he matched the description of a man suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a grocery store and that he resisted arrest. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, according to the criminal complaint detailing charges against Chauvin. In addition to igniting the turmoil in Minneapolis, Floyd’s death has garnered national attention, and it drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and also said he could not breathe. The delay in Chauvin’s arrest may have also helped to drive the protests, which turned markedly more violent than those that followed the deaths of either Clark or Castile. Authorities arrested Chauvin and charged him Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His attorney had no comment when reached by the AP. The other three officers involved have not been charged, but the investigation is continuing. All four were fired Tuesday shortly after the video began circulating. Some activists and community leaders said they expected the protests to continue to push for the arrests of and charges for the three other officers. Floyd’s death “just touched people in a way that they didn’t expect,” said Armstrong. “We must get to the underlying solutions or we will be right back here in a fairly short time,” said Keith Ellison, the state’s first African American attorney general, whose son is the Minneapolis city councilman. “We’ve got to literally shift policing.” Ramsey County Undersheriff Bill Finney, who in 1992 became the first African American police chief in Minnesota when he was appointed to the job in neighboring St. Paul, said even when the relationship between police and the black community improves, all sides must guard against complacency. “You have to constantly make deposits into the community bank of goodwill,” Finney said. “You want to get to a place where the community stops considering you as ‘the police’ and starts seeing you as their police.” Latest News",0.0

Floyd died after a police officer knelt on his neck in Minnesota during an arrest for suspected forgery. In Roanoke, hundreds of demonstrators with the Black Lives Matter movement gathered at 3 p.m. Saturday at Washington Park and members of the city’s NAACP chapter spoke before they marched up Gainsboro Road, holding signs and chanting “hands up, don’t shoot.” One Roanoke protester has been detained. Charges against them are unknown at this time. Demonstrators then made their way across the bridge into downtown Roanoke onto Campbell Ave., toward the Roanoke City Police Department. Below are videos that were taken live by our teams in the field as demonstrations unfolded: Members of the Roanoke chapter of the NAACP spoke to a crowd of protestors as demonstrations began. The group then made their way up Gainsboro Road as officers with the Roanoke City Police Department suited up with riot gear. Protesters then made their way to the Roanoke City Police Department in downtown Roanoke, where officers set up a barricade that demonstrators went around. Officers could be heard telling protesters to leave or they could be arrested. Demonstrators could be heard chanting “hands up, don’t shoot” in front of the Roanoke City Police Department, where the line was drawn on Campbell Ave. in front of the station. An officer was seen passing out tear gas canisters as authorities told protesters to get back behind the line. Protests have erupted across the nation, including in Richmond on Friday, as well as other cities across the commonwealth throughout the weekend. Demonstrators marched, stopped traffic and in some cases lashed out violently at police as protests erupted Friday in dozens of U.S. cities following the killing of George Floyd after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota. Georgia’s governor declared a state of emergency in one county to activate up to 500 members of the state National Guard “to protect people & property in Atlanta.” At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said In Minneapolis, where a police precinct was burned the night before, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring an 8 p.m. curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted ”“No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.”",0.0

Brown NNPA Newswire Senior Correspondent @StacyBrownMedia Like very few others, Ice Cube is celebrated for his groundbreaking accomplishments in music, film, sports and entrepreneurship. The legendary South-Central Los Angeles-born megastar is currently celebrating the 30th anniversary of his debut solo album, Amerikka’s Most Wanted, and the release of his 31st feature film, The High Note, which stars Cube, Tracee Ellis Ross and Dakota Johnson. On Thursday, May 21, Cube sat for an exclusive interview with the National Newspaper Publishers Association (NNPA). The discussion was broadcast live on Facebook and YouTube (facebook.com/blackpressusa/live and youtube.com/nnpa) and archived to various platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, and Vimeo.com. “The NNPA is pleased excited to do this live stream with our Brother Leader Ice Cube on behalf of the Black Press of America,” said Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr., NNPA president and CEO. “Cube continues to spit truth to power in his lyrics, videos, music and the genius of his creative talent and high energy. In addition to learning more about his latest project, our discussion is especially important in light of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic and the increased racial tension between African Americans and the police.” “Thirty years ago, Ice Cube dropped his debut solo album, Amerikkka’s Most Wanted. After leaving N.W.A., he became an instant solo star, and his first video for Who’s the Mack, even takes a shot at Trump,” noted Andrew Barber, the founder of the influential music blog, Fake Shore Drive, in a tweet this week. “A true visionary and trendsetter.” Born in 1969, Cube’s rise to superstardom began in the 1980s as a member of the group, N.W.A., which featured Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, DJ Yella, and MC Ren. As young visionaries, N.W.A. took the music world by storms with cutting and hard-hitting lyrics that included the 1988 blockbuster, Straight Outta Compton, which sold north of 3 million copies. One of N.W.A.’s most successful and controversial singles, F… tha Police, delved into the divide between young Black men and law enforcement. A divide that has evolved into a chasm with police shootings of unarmed African Americans occurring almost daily. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading. When asked in a recent interview about the song, Cube reiterated why he and his bandmates believed the song was important in 1988, and why it still resonates today. “At the time, Daryl Gates, who was the chief of police over at the LAPD, had declared a war on gangs. A war on gangs, to me, is a politically correct word to say a war on anybody you think is a gang member,” Cube told the website, Colorlines. “So, the way we dressed and the way we looked and where we come from, you can mistake any kid for a gang member. Any good kid. Some of them dress like gangbangers, and they go to school every day because that’s the fashion in the neighborhood,” Cube stated. “So, to declare that, it meant a war on every black kid with a baseball hat on, with a T-shirt on, some jeans and some tennis shoes. So, it was just too much to bear, to be under that kind of occupying force, who was abusive. It’s just; enough is enough. Our music was our only weapon. Nonviolent protest.” After his debut solo album, Cube took the big screen by storm with a stirring performance in John Singleton’s 1992 movie, Boyz n the Hood. Cube has established a long-standing reputation for developing film franchises that are both critically-acclaimed and commercially successful, including Barbershop, Friday, Ride-A-Long, and Are We There, Yet? “I keep the fire in me,” Cube has said. “You gotta be able to survive in whatever environment you find yourself.

Police cars and government buildings burned, the National Guard was deployed, and some of the country's largest cities instituted curfews. In one Midwest city, a person was killed and at least two more shot. More than 1,400 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday, the Associated Press reported. Former officer Derek Chauvin faces the charges in Floyd's death, but activist groups say they are inadequate. Video from a bystander showed Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The demonstrations Saturday were part of a National Day of Protest against Chauvin and police brutality inflicted nationwide. Protesters also called out the names of other people of color killed by police, including Louisville's Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old ER tech who was shot and killed by police in March. Here is a city-by-city look at what's happening across the country. Indianapolis: One dead after shooting One person was killed Saturday and at least two more shot during a second night of protests downtown, Indianapolis Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed in a hastily called late-night press conference. ""Enough is enough,"" Taylor said as sirens blared and fire trucks raced past on the street. ""Indianapolis, we are better than this. Downtown is not safe at this time.” Police did not have details on the individual who was killed nor the conditions of the others shot. Shortly before 1 a.m., the department tweeted again that it was investigating additional reports of shootings downtown. The shootings did not involve officers, police said. Protests during the day Saturday had been peaceful. — Staff of The Indianapolis Star Nashville: Fires at courthouse and City Hall building Fires in Nashville led Mayor John Cooper to declare a state of civil emergency. Police announced a 10 p.m. curfew for the city, and Gov. Bill Lee deployed the National Guard. Dozens of protesters had gathered on the steps of Nashville's criminal courthouse and City Hall after a rally and march. Demonstrators smashed windows with rocks and other materials, drawing a swarm of police. The situation at the building appeared to subside around 7:30 p.m. By 8:15 p.m., fire was visible from a first-floor office at the courthouse. A short time later, police with riot gear arrived as a fire burned inside a window at City Hall. Officers deployed tear gas as demonstrators clustered in the center of Public Square Park. — Staff of The Tennessean Reno, Nevada: Fires at City Hall; National Guard, curfew in place The Nevada National Guard is en route to downtown Reno, the city's police chief said, after protests there turned violent Saturday. Gov. Steve Sisolak tweeted he activated the Nevada National Guard. A group of people broke windows at Reno City Hall Saturday night and set fires there following hours of protest in the area. Responding Reno police fired tear gas into City Hall. Items such as a couch inside were on fire but soon put out. Police dispersed the protesters as some chanted ""Hands up, don't shoot."" Washoe County residents, which includes all residents in Reno and Sparks, are under curfew until 7 a.m. Sunday, police said Saturday evening. — Amy Alonzo, Siobhan McAndrew and Benjamin Spillman, Reno Gazette Journal New York City: Videos show vehicle's confrontation with crowd Hundreds of protesters walked against traffic in Manhattan on Saturday afternoon, temporarily stalling vehicles on 7th Ave. The group chanted: “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.” Late Saturday, videos circulated on social media that show a police vehicle driving into a crowd of protesters, after objects were thrown at the vehicle. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the video ""upsetting"" and said he wishes the officer ""hadn't done that."" He added: ""It’s clear that a different element has come into play here, who are trying to hurt police officers and trying to damage their vehicles."" He said the situation was started by a group of protesters converging on the police car and attacking it. Other video showed at least one vehicle on fire. An initially peaceful demonstration in the city had spiraled into chaos Friday, as protesters skirmished with police officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. Video posted to social media on Friday showed officers using batons and shoving protesters as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed an officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her. Denver: Car crashes into police; weapons confiscated Three officers and a civilian were ""severely"" injured when a car crashed into a Denver police vehicle, the police department tweeted late Saturday. Police said they were searching for a Chevrolet compact car with Wyoming plates. The city had enacted a curfew from 8 p.m. until 5 a.m. A few agitators, the department said, were ""hijacking"" Floyd's memory. Police shared photos of a gun, a gas canister and a hatchet — all of which were confiscated Saturday. ""Last night, agitators brought crowbars, baseball bats, assault rifles, hand guns and improvised flash-bangs which were thrown at police officers and protesters,” Chief Paul Pazen said in a statement on Saturday. Police on Saturday announced 34 arrests over the last two nights in Denver amid Floyd protests. San Francisco: Fireworks outside mayor’s apartment after curfew Videos from the scene show protesters lighting fireworks outside of San Francisco Mayor London Breed’s apartment. Late Saturday, Breed made an announcement alongside the city’s police chief, sheriff and fire chief implementing a curfew from 8 p.m. until 5 a.m. She also said the National Guard is on standby for the city. “If you are home, please stay home. If you are in our city from other places, please go back to the city that you live in. Please do not come into San Francisco and destroy our city,” Breed said. Breed said there were peaceful protests early Saturday, but the violence and vandalism exhibited later in the day are “something we will not tolerate.” Chief Bill Scott said officers were dealing with looting and people breaking windows.

Police arrested 74 people on charges of inciting a riot, the department tweeted. An additional 15 people were arrested on charges of vandalizing buildings.

Protesters marched and chanted ""No justice! No peace!"" and ""I can't breathe!"" – a phrase Floyd was heard saying before his death – in Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House and along surrounding streets. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., stood with peaceful protesters outside the White House during the afternoon. Protesters stood facing a line of police wearing helmets and holding shields, the officers with their backs to the White House. At times, some protesters tried to knock over barriers or attacked officers around the White House perimeter, although none scaled the surrounding fence, according to the Secret Service. ""Multiple"" special agents and uniformed officers were injured when some protesters threw bricks, rocks, bottles and fireworks at officers, officials said. Officers responded by firing tear gas to break up the crowds. President Donald Trump attended the historic SpaceX rocket launch in Florida during the afternoon, but arrived back at the White House around 8:30 p.m. as protests raged outside. As the presidential helicopters buzzed overheard near the White House grounds, some demonstrators shouted obscenities and shook their fists.

Mayor Muriel Bowser tweeted Saturday that the city's police department would protect everyone, regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. — Nicholas Wu, David Jackson, Courtney Subramanian and John Fritze, USA TODAY Cincinnati: Violence, clashes with police as night falls Another wave of civil unrest hit Cincinnati’s streets Saturday as peaceful protests gave way to violence for the second consecutive night, with police firing tear gas and making arrests. Tensions between police and demonstrators boiled over outside District 1 police headquarters after 9 p.m., when some protesters began throwing debris at officers who had gathered outside the entrance with riot shields. Police responded by pushing the crowd away, firing tear gas and bean bag rounds as they marched forward. At one point, some in the crowd tried to build a makeshift barrier with trash cans, but police pushed through and arrested several people. Others fled down streets and alleys. — Dan Horn, Madeline Mitchell, Cameron Knight and Sharon Coolidge, The Cincinnati Enquirer Des Moines, Iowa: Protesters throw fireworks at police Police in riot gear met protesters marching on the state’s Capitol building. Some protesters could be seen throwing fireworks at police. At the Polk County Courthouse, protesters scattered after police fired tear gas into the crowd. There were conflicting reports about whether a protester managed to get into the courthouse. One person was seen breaking a glass window. — Des Moines Register staff Minneapolis: Projectiles fired to clear protesters The National Guard started moving into downtown Minneapolis on Saturday, after days of unrest. ""The situation in Minnesota is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cites,"" Gov. Tim Walz said in a press conference. An 8 p.m. curfew would be strictly enforced, major highways would be closed and those on the streets Saturday night could be subject to arrest, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Saint Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said Saturday night. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Walz said. As curfew approached, hundreds of protesters sat to await the arrival of law enforcement near Fifth Precinct. One commented that police couldn't arrest the whole group. Soon, black-clad law enforcement approached to the sound of explosions. Some demonstrators chanted: “Hands up, don’t shoot!” Police officers fired nonlethal projectiles toward masses of people, including a crowd of journalists gathered in an alley next to a looted store. Protesters reported tear gas being used. Some people hobbled away from an intersection appearing to be injured. ""State Patrol troopers are moving in to secure the Fifth Precinct. Go home and obey the curfew order now,"" Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. — Trevor Hughes and Jordan Culver, USA TODAY Los Angeles: Looting and destruction mount, mayor sets curfew Looting and property destruction mounted Saturday in Los Angeles as police worked to disperse protesters after the third evening of mass demonstrations. City Mayor Eric Garcetti set a curfew from 8 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. throughout the whole city. Police set up skirmish lines throughout the downtown area and fired non-lethal ammunition in at least one incident, City News Service reported. Garcetti requested the National Guard. Protesters looted several downtown businesses, including a Target store, a Rite Aid, a Starbucks and jewelry stores near Sixth Street and Broadway. Fires were ignited near the intersection of Hill and Seventh Street, and in one case, a person threw the hose being used by a firefighter into a smoldering fire. Garcetti urged residents to go home. “When things burn, it is not the time to stay,” he said. Taking part in civil unrest, he added, does a disservice to Floyd's memory. He noted Los Angeles has seen unrest over racial issues before, a nod to the Watts Riots in 1965 and the disturbance after the Rodney King verdict that exonerated the police officers who were videotaped beating him in 1992. — Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY Fayetteville, North Carolina: Reporter injured as looters break into J.C. Penney Protests turned violent in Fayetteville even after police opted to close access to downtown areas of the city. People reportedly went to a local mall and were seen running in an out of the J.C. Penney amid reports of looting.

When police horses entered the area, a chaotic few seconds followed: Police barricades tumbled to the ground and people fell down. Glass bottles flew through the air. At one point the crowd chanted: ""No justice, no peace."" The standoff was a dramatic contrast from a peaceful protest march earlier in the evening. That demonstration had apparently ended without arrests, and the police had largely let it play out on its own, without interference. Most of the crowd from the protest march left around 9 p.m. — Laura Testino, Desiree Stennett, Daniel Connolly, Corinne S Kennedy and Samuel Hardiman, Memphis Commercial Appeal Detroit: Day starts peacefully, turns violent Saturday, in the light of day, the protesting crowd appeared to be mostly peaceful, with police following marching protesters closely and even handing out masks, a coronavirus precaution, to those who did not have them. The situation changed late in the evening. A new — and larger — crowd filled downtown and turned violent. In the skirmishes, Detroit Free Press reporters were exposed to tear gas, and a phone was violently knocked out of a photographer's hand. Police in riot gear, supported by armored cars, moved toward protesters. Crowds began to gather at about 4:30 p.m. Most wore masks, and many carried signs, some with angry slogans. By about 8 p.m., and just after a moment of tension between protesters and police, the crowd began to disperse, with a few folks saying they'd be back again for a third day of demonstrations at 4 p.m. Sunday.

The police department asked residents to stay away from Miami's downtown and Wynwood areas, citing a ""situation involving large crowds of protestors."" The Miami Herald reported protests in the area started peacefully but eventually devolved into violence. Flint, Michigan: Sheriff walks with protesters Video showed Genessee County Sheriff Christopher Swanson walking with protesters Saturday after taking off his riot gear. He joined the demonstration to cheers from attendees. In a video posted to Facebook, Swanson told the gathered protesters, ""We want to be with y'all, for real. I took the helmet off; they laid the batons down. We want to make this a parade."" As Swanson was talking, the crowd began to chant, ""Walk with us!"" Swanson began walking with the crowd, saying he could walk all night. Chicago: Demonstration outside Trump Tower; curfew in place Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced a curfew for the city, effective between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Earlier, hundreds of protesters gathered downtown at Federal Plaza on Saturday afternoon for a demonstration organized by Black Lives Matter.

There were no agitators or counter-protesters. The News Leader is still at the court house interviewing people. We'll have more in-depth coverage later. 8:25 p.m. Ophie Kier is now speaking.

This disturbing image is one that I personally will never forget. I truly cannot imagine the pain and anguish that must be felt by Mr. Floyd's family and friends. ""While it is difficult to make sense of the sudden loss of anyone's life, it is simply reprehensible when that life is taken away at the hands of a uniformed police officer who has taken a solemn oath to protect and serve his community. The basic principles of law enforcement require that officers only use physical force when it is absolutely necessary and then they must only use the minimum necessary force with which to effect an arrest. 'I realize that watching such a disturbing scene involving a police officer committing such an atrocity will make some people question whether something like this could happen in their own community. ""As your police chief, I would like to assure you that the men and women of the Staunton Police Department are highly motivated and well-trained, and committed to enforcing the law while treating all citizens of and visitors to the City of Staunton respectfully, fairly and impartially. ""Our department has worked hard to establish genuine relationships and build trust in our community, and we ask you to continue to partner with us as we all work together through these challenging times. While we are not perfect, we will continue to strive to be a police department our community can trust to carry out our vital mission."" 7:57 p.m. “No justice, no peace,” being chanted by the crowd.

All black lives matter, not just the ones in big cities."" ""I want Staunton PD to understand that it is not enough to be neutral in times like these or in fact any time, they must be proactive in their condemnation of brutality and transparent in their efforts to remain ethical and nonviolent,"" Lipscomb wrote. ""Derek Chauvin put George Floyd face down on the ground and pressed his knee into that man's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds while Mr. Floyd begged and pleaded for his life,"" Lipscomb wrote. ""Derek Chauvin knew he was being recorded and still murdered George Floyd in cold blood."" Lipscomb said the 6th leading cause of death of young men regardless of race in 2019 was police violence. 7:21 p.m. The crowd has grown to about 25 people. Lipscomb asked The News Leader not to “ask anyone's name or identifying information in attendance tonight. They will be instructed to only speak to the media on the condition of anonymity.” The News Leader doesn’t use anonymous quotes. A few have already given me their names and talked with me. 7:12 p.m. I’m in downtown Staunton where members of the community are gathering for “Justice for George Floyd” rally. It is supposed to begin at 7:30. We’re in the BB&T parking lot. Small crowd so far of about 12, most still in their cars. pic.twitter.com/GYwYF9141j — Patrick Hite (@Patrick_Hite) May 30, 2020 7:00 p.m. Numerous Facebook posts say the rally will start at 7:30 p.m. at the BB&T parking lot on Augusta Street. One post says the march will then move on downtown. An earlier post said the march would go to the police station, but more recent posts said the march would go to the Augusta County courthouse, which has been the anchor-point of many social justice marches in the city. Posts say ""PPE req"" so organizers are apparently intent on some form of social distancing during the march. Benjamin Lipscomb, the point of contact mentioned in the posts, would not offer any comment on a request for more details. Support local journalism today.

In Richmond, at least one car, a Dumpster and a GRTC Pulse bus were set afire. Protests continued in pockets of the city long after the first demonstration had dispersed. By 1 a.m., officers in full riot gear were guarding Richmond police headquarters on W. Grace Street, which protesters had surrounded hours earlier. Blocks away, officers used pepper spray to move demonstrators off the street near the intersection of Monroe and Broad, where a GRTC Pulse bus had been set on fire. “You want to die, bro?” one officer yelled at a demonstrator as the blaze grew larger. “Back up.” Some of the protesters began to chant “Black lives matter” as the bus — powered by natural gas — went up in a jet of flames. Gunshots were fired in the air by protesters, police said, though there were no known injuries, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. Capitol Square remained closed today. “A window was broken in the Barbara Johns Building, which houses the Office of the Attorney General, and the Virginia Capitol Visitor’s Entrance, Virginia Supreme Court Building and Washington Building were vandalized as crowds surrounded Capitol Square,” Capitol Police said in a statement. In Hampton Roads, demonstrators temporarily shut down the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel, The Virginian-Pilot Reported. ”All lives won’t matter until black lives matter,” one demonstrator told the paper. This morning in Richmond, several shops along Broad Street were cleaning up broken glass and crews were working to haul away the burned out GRTC bus. Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck in a video captured by a bystanders, was arrested Friday on murder and manslaughter charges. In a statement Friday, Gov. Ralph Northam said it had been “such a sad and emotional week, with too many violent and blatant reminders of how far our country is from genuine equity and fair treatment. “George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and many others have been wrongfully killed, simply for being black. People all over our country are hurting and angry, and rightly so,” Northam said. “People are crying out for justice and healing. But those aren’t feelings—they’re actions, and we have a lot of work to do in this country and in our commonwealth.” Mercury reporter Ned Oliver contributed to this story.",0.0

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune via AP) CHICAGO – Several police cars were damaged, including at least one set on fire, as protests continued Saturday over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Officers struck multiple demonstrators with batons amid the protest near the Trump Tower on the city's Near North Side, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Video sent out by another local reporter also showed police in tactical gear walking on a downtown street. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced a 9 p.m curfew that runs until 6 a.m. Sunday. Lightfoot condemned Floyd's death during a Saturday night news conference and defended the idea of demonstrating to honor him. But she added that a peaceful protest has “devolved into criminal conduct” and police will be aggressive with arrests for anyone caught damaging property. “When you or anyone else behaves in this way, we all lose by giving the very same forces of oppression we are fighting against the false validation that they crave,” the mayor said. The crowd of thousands converged on Chicago's Loop for Saturday's protest march. The demonstration began at 2 p.m. and protesters began marching north about 90 minutes later, the Chicago Tribune reported. Saturday's demonstration came after Chicago officials, following overnight clashes with protesters, asked that additional protests remain peaceful. Demonstrations are expected throughout the weekend over Floyd's death. Chicago police Superintendent David Brown said peaceful protests that began Friday afternoon turned more confrontational as the night wore on, resulting in 108 arrests. Protesters blocked traffic along major streets, threw bottles and other objects at police vehicles and shattered the windows of downtown businesses. About a dozen squad cars were damaged and some officers suffered minor injuries, including a broken wrist. The violence in Chicago and many other cities was sparked by anger over over Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on Monday, which was captured on cellphone video. It led to the firing Tuesday of the four police officers who were arresting Floyd for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill and to third-degree murder and manslaughter charges being filed Friday against the officer who used his knee to pin Floyd down for more than eight minutes, even as Floyd pleaded for air and went limp.",0.0

Trump is en route to Kennedy Space Center for the SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) The Latest on the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck: ___ INDIANAPOLIS - Authorities are investigating “multiple shootings,” including one that left a person dead, in downtown Indianapolis on Saturday amid protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed the shootings during a late night news conference, but didn’t offer any more details. Police later tweeted that no officers were involved. Protests became dangerous for a second straight night in Indianapolis as buildings were damaged, officers deployed tear gas and at least one business was briefly on fire. ___ Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence in a statement, as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. “It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.” ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Officials in Minneapolis say they’ve succeeded for now in stopping the violent protests that ravaged parts of the city for several days after the death of George Floyd. Police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in to break up protests after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days where police mostly declined to engage with protesters. It also came after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard members and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. As Minneapolis streets appeared largely quiet, Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the heavy response would remain as long as it takes to “quell this situation.” Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes. ___ RICHMOND, Va. — The Richmond, Virginia, police headquarters was the target of protesters for the second night in a row as officers formed a barricade around the building late Saturday night. A dumpster was set afire near the police headquarters, which had its front windows broken out Friday night. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the police fired tear gas to move crowds away from the building. Several blocks away near Virginia Commonwealth University hundreds of protesters blocked streets chanting “George Floyd,” referring to the black man who died Monday after an arresting officer in Minneapolis pushed his knee into Floyd’s neck while he was on the ground handcuffed. Media reports showed video of protesters hurling what appeared to be water bottles at a police car, which moved through the crowd and sped away. A police cruiser was burned in the violence on Friday night, along with a city bus. ___ LOS ANGELES -- The mayor of Los Angeles says the National Guard will be deployed overnight to help local law enforcement quell violence in the nation’s second-largest city. Mayor Eric Garcetti says he asked California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday to send 500 to 700 members of the Guard. Crowds of demonstrators have torched police cars, vandalized and burglarized stores and clashed with lines of officers. Hundreds of people have been arrested since Friday night. ___ SALT LAKE CITY — Protests are continuing in Salt Lake City despite a curfew issued by the mayor and National Guard troops deployed by Utah’s governor. Police officials say they are prepared to give people time to leave, but they plan to arrest people who refused to comply. What started as a peaceful demonstration Saturday against the death of George Floyd turned destructive. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. A second car was later set on fire. Police officials say six people have been arrested and that a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. ___ RENO, Nevada -- City officials in Reno instituted an immediate mandatory curfew Saturday night after protesters broke windows at City Hall and set fires. Police fired tear gas into the building, the Rene Gazette Journal reported, and a SWAT team arrived to help disperse the crowd. The fires were extinguished. In announcing the curfew in a statement, city officials asked residents to avoid the downtown area, where a “heavy police presence” would be in force overnight. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. — More than 1,000 people marched in downtown Raleigh on Saturday night, breaking windows as police in riot gear released tear gas and pepper spray to disburse the crowds. WRAL-TV showed video of throngs of people in front of the Wake County Courthouse, some walking with signs, others on bikes and skateboards to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a police officer on Monday. Protesters gathered in late afternoon marching peacefully north from the courthouse chanting “No Justice, No Peace.” But tension grew after nightfall as some people threw rocks at windows and spray painted anti-police slogans on walls. Fayetteville Street was the focus of most of the vandalism with multiple buildings along the street having windows broken out. ___ MIAMI — A student at Florida International University said the protest was largely peaceful with the crowd of about 500 “singing, we were doing poetry” and urging each other not to “break windows” or hurt businesses. But when they arrived at the police station, another group of protesters also converged there and things escalated within minutes. “There was a sniper on the roof with the police chief standing next to him and they started throwing smoke bombs to the crowd,"" 27-year-old Liseth Hatta said. “Most of them were kids. They couldn’t’ have been older than 21. Everyone ran away screaming;” They tried to flee and rushed to the train station to head home, but police closed down the entrance. “A lot of people tried to get back on the train to leave and they weren’t letting us,” Hatta said. “They basically trapped us in.” ___ ATLANTA — An Atlanta police officer was struck by someone riding an ATV in downtown Atlanta during protests that continued despite a curfew, and police said they were still trying to determine whether the crash was deliberate. Police spokesman Carlos Campos said it happened about 10:30 p.m.; the mayor had set a 9 p.m. curfew. The officer suffered significant injuries and was in stable condition, Campos said. The ATV drive suffered minor injuries and was taken into custody, Campos said. ___ LOS ANGELES — Police have arrested nearly 1,400 people in 17 U.S. cities as protests continue over the death of George Floyd. Floyd died Monday in Minnesota after a police officer put his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes. The officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder. But the arrest has done little to quell protests across the country. Most have been peaceful. But a few have erupted in violence. An Associated Press tally of arrests found at least 1,383 people have been arrested since Thursday. The actual number is likely higher as protests continue Saturday night. ___ WASHINGTON — The National Guard has been called out in Washington, D.C., as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump’s reaction to it. Hundreds of protesters converged on the White House during the day Saturday and marched on the National Mall, chanting “Black Lives Matter,” “I can’t breathe” and “No justice, no peace.” Police used pepper spray to try to disperse the crowd but the standoff continued. Protesters dragged away barricades and some broke up concrete to use as projectiles. At one point, a trash bin was set on fire. National Guard troops took up position around the White House on Saturday night.___ WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump appears to be cheering on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement around the country to confront sometimes violent demonstrators joining in protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. On Saturday, the president commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” He also said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” In a tweet, Trump said: “Let New York’s Finest be New York’s Finest.” He was commenting on Twitter from the White House while crowds of protesters gathered outside. ___ NASHVILLE, Tennessee — The mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, has declared a state of civil emergency after protesters set a fire inside the Metro Courthouse in the state’s capital city. Thousands had rallied near the Capitol building Saturday afternoon to peacefully protest police brutality and racism. But things turned violent after darkness fell, with protesters breaking windows in government buildings and causing other property damage. The Tennessean newspaper says demonstrators also pulled down a statue outside the Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views. Police deployed tear gas and began warning demonstrators that the protest was unlawful. Gov. Bill Lee issued an order Saturday night for the National Guard to mobilize “in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville.” ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Police in Minneapolis are confronting protesters out after curfew on the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd. A group of marchers was moving north toward downtown on a city street when officers fired tear gas Saturday night. The group immediately retreated. Soon after, officers fired tear gas and moved in to push away throngs of protesters who were milling around the city police’s 5th Precinct. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not more strongly confronting violent and damaging protests. Minneapolis has been the epicenter of protests since the death Monday of Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for some eight minutes. The protests have spread to cities across the United States. ___ CHICAGO — Chicago’s mayor has announced an overnight curfew in the city running from 9 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday, and she says police will crack down on any violence. Mayor Lori Lightfoot says that peaceful protesting over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has “devolved into criminal conduct.” She says police will be aggressive with arrests for anyone caught damaging property. In the mayor’s words: “We can have zero tolerance for people who came prepared for a fight and tried to initiate and provoke our police department.” ___ MIAMI — An initially peaceful protest in Miami over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has turned violent, with some demonstrators setting fire to police cars. Witnesses to the clash Saturday say officers responded with tear gas and fireworks to disperse the crowd. The mayor has declared a 10 p.m. curfew. At one point, Interstate 95 was shut down as protesters stood on the busy highway. Police also used bicycles to push back an increasingly rowdy crowd throwing rocks. Elsewhere in Florida, protesters in Tampa smashed store windows and set a gas station ablaze Saturday night after a peaceful demonstration during the day. Some broke into AT&T and Gold N Diamond stores. ___ Curfews are in effect or imminent in more than a dozen U.S. cities facing rising unrest following the death of George Floyd. The start times Saturday evening range from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People are being told to get off the streets beginning at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. in Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle. A curfew is in effect for a second night in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died earlier this week after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes during an arrest. Thousands ignored the Friday night curfew and peaceful protests gave way to violence late into the night. ___ PHILADELPHIA — Authorities in Philadelphia say a peaceful demonstration protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis later turned violence, and at least 13 police officers have been injured amid incidents of arson and store break-ins in the city's doqwntown. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw says at least four police vehicles were set ablaze and other fires were set throughout downtown Saturday afternoon. Protesters smashed windows and stole merchandise from stores as police tried to worked to corral the crowd, which Outlaw estimates numbered about 3,000. Protesters also sprayed graffiti on a statue of former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, tried to topple it and set a fire at its base. Rizzo was Philadelphia's mayor from 1972 to 1980 and was praised by supporters as tough on crime but accused by critics of discriminating against minorities. Authorities in Philadelphia have ordered a citywide curfew has been implemented from 8 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday. ___ SALT LAKE CITY — Utah Gov. Gary Herbert has activated the Utah National Guard after protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent during a demonstration at which some participants carried rifles in Salt Lake City. Herbert says in a tweet that the Guard will help control “the escalating situation” in the downtown area following the unrest Saturday afternoon. The protest started out peacefully, but degenerated into violence. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. Some demonstrators smashed eggs and wrote graffiti on the walls of the Salt Lake City police station. Others marched through downtown to the state Capitol. Some people in the protest openly carried rifles, which is legal in Utah. ___ LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has imposed a downtown curfew for Saturday night after some protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent. With protesters were back out Saturday, Garcetti said everyone must be off down town streets by 8 p.m. and stay away until 5:30 a.m. Several police cars were torched Saturday afternoon as some protesters ignored authorities’ call for peaceful demonstrations. That followed a night of violence during which people smashed windows, robbed stores and set fires. Los Angeles police reported arresting 533 people during the night. ___ SEATTLE — The Washington State Patrol has closed Interstate 5 in both directions through downtown Seattle after a protest over the death of George Floyd spilled onto the freeway. Thousands of people gathered in the downtown area Saturday for a largely peaceful demonstration, but some protesters turned rowdier as the afternoon worn on. Police used pepper spray on the demonstrators and deployed flash bang devices. Police said arrests were made but an exact figure wasn’t available. State patrol Chief John Batiste said in a statement that ”the freeway is not a safe or appropriate place for demonstration.” ___ ATLANTA — A crowd has gathered in Atlanta to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and some people have started throwing objects at officers guarding the Georgia governor’s mansion. Hundreds of people stood on a residential sidewalk Saturday evening across the street from the mansion in the city’s affluent Buckhead neighborhood. Cars and motorcyclists continued to sporadically drive by in front of the demonstrators. Authorities responded by taking at least one person into custody. Gov. Brian Kemp was not inside the home Saturday evening. Earlier in the day, Atlanta’s mayor announced a curfew will be in effect in the city from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday. That order followed a night of violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over Floyd's death. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Several Minneapolis City Council members are asking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to appoint the state’s attorney general as a special prosecutor in the death of George Floyd. Six of the council’s 13 members say they support a call from Floyd’s family for Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution of the police officer who held his knee on Floyd’s neck Monday. The council members say they don’t think Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has the public trust necessary for the job. Freeman on Friday charged now-fired officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death. Chauvin is white; Floyd was black. The council members say Freeman waited too long in bringing charge. They say Ellison, who is black, is best qualified to handle the case. They also cite a working group he helped lead on deaths involving police. ___ WASHINGTON — Several hundred people shouting “Black Lives Matter” and “I can’t breathe” have converged on the White House for a second straight day to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump’s response. Trump earlier on Saturday belittled the protesters and he pledged to “stop mob violence.” Speaking in Florida after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket, the president said: “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos are the missions at hand.” Three lines of barricades separate protesters from a loose line of uniformed police officers at Lafayette Park, across from the White House. At one point, the protesters left the park, chanting as they marched up a nearby street. A block from the White House, they held a moment of silence and brief sit-in. ___ ATLANTA -- Atlanta’s mayor has announced a curfew will be in effect from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday following violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the curfew during a news conference Saturday evening. She called it a “very unusual and extreme step” after the violence that rocked Atlanta during Friday night. Several other cities across the nation have order curfews following unrest surrounding demonstrations protesting Floyd's death. Georgia’s governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. In Friday’s protests, some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters downtown. Police say at least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at a restaurant because of crowds of protesters. ___ NEW YORK — Protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have returned to the streets of New York for a third straight day as Mayor Bill de Blasio pleads for calm after a demonstration in Brooklyn the previous night descended into chaos that left people bloodied and vehicles burned. On Saturday, a large crowd marched through Harlem, chanted outside a police precinct and then blocked traffic on the highway along Manhattan’s East River. Demonstrations of several thousand at Union Square and outside Brooklyn’s Prospect Park appeared mostly peaceful. Late in the day, protesters in Brooklyn confronted police, who shoved some of the demonstrators and used an irritating chemical spray. De Blasio expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset over police brutality, but promised an independent review of the Friday night confrontation in which both protesters and police officers engaged in violence. The mayor said he was upset by videos of the clashes in which “protesters were handled very violently” by police and by reports that a state senator and member of the state Assembly were among the people sprayed with irritating chemicals by officers. ___ CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla — President Donald Trump says he will not tolerate mob violence during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The president made the comment as he spoke in Florida after watching the successful launch of a SpaceX rocket Saturday. He turned his attention to the unrest in American cities following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis before he congratulated NASA and others involved in the space mission. Trump says the rule of law is the crown jewel of the country and that “my administration will stop mob violence and we’ll stop it cold.” Trump says that “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred. Justice not chaos are the missions at hand.”",0.0

1621225689,2020-05-30 20:47:00,"Protests heat up across US, governors call in National Guard",https://www.wfxrtv.com/news/protests-heat-up-across-us-governors-call-in-national-guard/,en,True,,576666,virginiafirst.com,http://virginiafirst.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Governors in several states called in National Guard troops as protests over repeated police killings of black men grew Saturday from New York to Cleveland (video above) to Tulsa to Los Angeles, where police fired rubber bullets to scatter crowds and at least one police car burned. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Monday’s death of George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of that city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. But the demonstrations have since become a national phenomenon, as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. In Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. Other peaceful protests were being held in California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. In Tulsa and Wilmington, Delaware, protesters made their way onto nearby interstates and shut them down temporarily. In Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck drove through a crowd of protesters, sending some running and screaming as the vehicle stopped and started and at one point had a person on its hood, police said, but no serious injuries were reported. In Columbia, South Carolina, a television reporter for WIS-TV was injured by rocks thrown Saturday amid protests outside the Columbia Police Department. Several hundred people participated in the demonstration, tearing down the American and state flags in front of the police department’s headquarters. They also swarmed a Columbia police car, breaking its windows, The State reported. In Los Angeles protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move protesters back and shot rubber bullets to scatter the crowd. One man used a skateboard to attempt to break the windshield of a police SUV. A spray painted police car burned in the streets. In Minneapolis, 29-year-old Sam Allkija, said at Saturday’s protest that the destruction that has accompanied protests is a sign of the frustration and rage the black community has felt for a long time. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful protests in dozens of cities. The previous day’s protests, too, had started calmly — in cities from New York to Oakland, California, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon — before many descended into violence. The massive crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for the spread of the coronavirus. Hundreds of people were arrested Friday, and police used batons, rubber bullets and pepper spray to push back crowds in some cities. Many departments reported officers were injured, while social media was awash in images of police using forceful tactics, throwing protesters to the ground, using bicycles as shields, and trampling a protester while on horseback. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals in Los Angeles. During the five days of rioting in 1992, more than 60 died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. On Friday, the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — but that appeared to provide little balm. Many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Comments from President Donald Trump stoked the anger, when he fired off a series of tweets criticizing Minnesota’s response, ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would … have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and offered sympathy for those who were protesting — but as unrest intensified, many spoke of the desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy handed tactics. The unrest prompted responses across the globe. A top Vatican cardinal, Peter Turkson who is from Ghana, urged pastors in the United States to plead for calm, while U.S. national soccer player Weston McKennie wore an armband referencing Floyd’s death while playing for Schalke in Germany’s Bundesliga. Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. The governor is also considering a potential offer of military police, which the Pentagon put on alert. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, and Cincinnati. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. And police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who had climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. Atlanta saw some of the most extreme unrest. While crews in that city worked to clean up glass and debris from rioting the night before, a large electronic billboard on Saturday morning still carried the message, “If you love Atlanta PLEASE GO HOME,” echoing the mayor’s pleas. National Guard members blocked anyone from approaching heavily damaged buildings, including the College Football Hall of Fame and nearby restaurants. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Underscoring that Floyd’s killing is part of a pattern, the names of black people killed by police, including Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Latest Stories Get breaking news, weather, and sports delivered to your smartphone with the WFXR News app available on Apple and Android.",0.0

A second trooper suffered a minor injury when struck in the leg with a rock.” “The protesters were given repeated verbal commands to disperse at that location, but have refused. In an effort to safely disperse the violent crowd, state police has utilized non-lethal tactics, such as OC ‘pepper’ spray and powder.” State police will remain on scene through the night to assist Prince William County Police, Geller said.

Lee Carter (D-50th Manassas) was sprayed with what was likely pepper spray, Saturday at 10:45 p.m., at the Prince William County Black Lives Matter-style protest on Sudley Road in Manassas. While it may have began as a peaceful protest, over time the assembly attracted incidence of violence and unruly behavior. Police determined it an “unlawful protest,” and advised people to avoid the area. In response to the violence, Virginia State Troopers arrived to assist the Prince William Police. According to a live citizen video, Carter, who attended the protest, knelt in front of officers in riot gear. As they stood in a line, he began asking them questions, such as “Why are you here?” No one answered him. Carter said they could answer him now or answer in front of the General Assembly. Carter then asked the reason they had “CS” or tear gas with them. He said he knew what it was because he is a Marine veteran. “I heard them calling for CS,” he said. “I don’t know if you all think it’s a good idea for your agency to lie to a legislator.” Officers started to disperse along Sudley Road, and Carter followed along to ask more questions. At that point, Carter fell back yelling and said that they used the CS on him. ‘They just CSed a member of the General Assembly!’ he cried. A few people ran to help Carter up and they helped him wash his eyes out with milk that they poured from a carton. Around 11:35 p.m., Corinne Geller, spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police said State Troopers used pepper spray and powder at the Manassas assembly. It is a man-made substance derived from hot peppers meant to sting the eyes. “The protesters were given repeated verbal commands to disperse at that location, but have refused. In an effort to safely disperse the violent crowd, state police has utilized non-lethal tactics, such as OC ‘pepper’ spray and powder,” she said. She said that at the time of the release CS gas (a carbon chemical compound) had not been used. Approximately 100 Prince William Police and State Police officers in protective gear were present at the scene. There were a few officers more heavily outfitted. Earlier live VDOT videos showed smoke in the crowd around 10 p.m. In the video that primarily featured Carter, the protesters appeared to be peaceful, except for throwing plastic water bottles. Some used offensive language. Prince William Police asked residents to avoid the area along Sudley Manor Road, saying it had evolved to a police action due to civil unrest. Many witnesses testify to objects being thrown: light objects like plastic water bottles, but also heavy objects such as large rocks and glass bottles. Two Virginia State Troopers were injured by people in the Manassas crowd according a statement. Others said windows of businesses had been broken, and a VDOT video shows a small fire along the road. Prince William Police reported just before 2 a.m., Sunday, that everyone had dispersed. The department will issue a statement later in the day. Bristow Beat will credit the citizen videographer at her request. As of now she asked that her video would not be publicly broadcasted. *Bristow Beat originally said Carter was sprayed with tear gas, but statements from the Virginia State Police suggests it was more likely pepper spray.

1621253437,2020-05-30 20:31:28,Tear gas and burning cars in US cities as unrest continues,https://www.progress-index.com/ZZ/news/20200530/tear-gas-and-burning-cars-in-us-cities-as-unrest-continues?rssfeed=true,en,True,,147801,progress-index.com,http://progress-index.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) "" Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country convulsed through another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. "" In Indianapolis, police were investigating 'multiple shootings' downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. "" In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. "" In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. "" In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. "" In Los Angeles, protesters chanted 'Black Lives Matter,' some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. "" And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. 'The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. 'We don't tolerate excessive use of force,' Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. 'The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,' said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. 'It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.' Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. 'l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: 'Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and saying police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an 'invisible enemy.' The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. 'Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. 'Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice.' This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would 'have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.' Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0
1621253432,2020-05-30 20:37:59,Officials blame differing groups of 'outsiders' for violence,https://www.progress-index.com/ZZ/news/20200530/officials-blame-differing-groups-of-outsiders-for-violence?rssfeed=true,en,True,,147801,progress-index.com,http://progress-index.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" As protests over the death of George Floyd grow in cities across the U.S., government officials have been warning of the 'outsiders' -- groups of organized rioters they say are flooding into major cities not to call for justice but to cause destruction. But the state and federal officials have offered differing assessments of who the outsiders are. They've blamed left-wing extremists, far-right white nationalists and even suggested the involvement of drug cartels. These leaders have offered little evidence to back up those claims, and the chaos of the protests makes verifying identities and motives exceedingly difficult. Police officers across the country were gearing up Saturday for another night of potentially violent clashes in major cities. Some states had even called in the National Guard to aid overwhelmed police. The finger pointing on both sides of the political spectrum is likely to deepen the political divide in the U.S., allowing politicians to advance the theory that aligns with their political view and distract from the underlying frustrations that triggered the protests. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday told reporters he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence and that even drug cartels 'are trying to take advantage of the chaos.' John Harrington, the state's commissioner of public safety, later said they had received intel reports on white supremacists. 'But I cannot say that we have confirmed observations of local law enforcement to say that we've seen cells of white supremacists in the area,' he said Saturday. But federal officials later pointed 'far left extremist groups."" President Donald Trump alleged the violence was 'being led by Antifa and other radical groups.' Antifa, short for anti-fascists, is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Attorney General William Barr later seemed to echo Trump's assertion, saying the violent incidents in Minneapolis were driven by groups using ""Antifa-like tactics."" Barr vowed that federal prosecutors across the country would use federal riots statutes to charge protesters who cross state lines to participate in violent rioting. A Justice Department spokesperson said the attorney general's assertion was based on information provided from state and local law enforcement agencies, but did not detail what that information entailed. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was even more vague, declining to point to any particular ideology in his assessment. His agency has heard that 'a number of different groups are involved in these whether it's Antifa or it's others, frankly,"" he said. The groups appeared to be organized and using tactics that wouldn't normally happen in peaceful protest, he said, though he didn't elaborate. While the motives behind the violence was unclear, there was firmer evidence that some of the protesters were coming to the demonstrations from outside the urban centers that have been the epicenter of the demonstrations. In New York City, federal officials were bringing charges against several suspects, including one of two sisters from upstate New York accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail through the back window of a police van in Brooklyn, a law enforcement official said. The initially peaceful demonstrations in New York City over Floyd's death spiraled into chaos as night fell Friday. Protester confronted police officers, destroying police vehicles and setting fires. In Detroit, 37 of the 60 people who were arrested in overnight protests did not live in the city "" and many came from nearby suburbs, police Chief James Craig said Saturday. Although Detroit is about 80% black, many of those arrested were white. 'We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,' Craig told reporters. 'If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community.' St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said Saturday he'd been told all of those arrested in his city Friday were from outside the state. 'What we are seeing right now is a group of people who are not from here,' he said. Carter expressed the opinion of many black activists in the Twin Cities who have expressed disbelief that local residents would destroy their own neighborhoods, burning down essential services and damaging small businesses. And while it was local protesters and groups that staged initial angry, but peaceful, demonstrations, it was agitators from elsewhere that strategically escalated the tension by causing damage and setting fires, they said. Their beliefs were reinforced by the large numbers of white people in the protests in Minneapolis. 'I think about third of the people are from out of town here to make the city burn,' said Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage. 'It is just putting black people in a crossfire not just between fascists and anarchists -- but putting us in a crossfire with the national guard.' It's exceedingly difficult in the chaos and dark of the events to prove these claims. The challenge is made harder in the Minnesota protest, where very few arrest were made in the first two nights of unrest. St. Paul arrest records showed 18 people were arrested on charges related to civil unrest from Thursday to early Saturday morning. Of those, only four were from outside the state; two were listed as unknown. Still, some civil rights leaders had a clear message for anyone coming to protest, even those who show up to call for justice for Floyd. 'The moment has passed. Go home, stay away from here. We are a vulnerable population. At the end of that day if black folks can't rebuild then the only thing we've done is build more power for white folks,"" said Terrell. ""You're talking about years, decades of work undone by these groups -- and by the officer.' Trump vowed Saturday that the 'radical left criminals, thugs and others' would 'not be allowed to set communities ablaze.' 'I will not allow angry mobs to dominate,' he said.' 'Won't happen.' ___ Hennessey reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Cape Canaveral, Fla., Michael R.

Young, of the Poor People's Campaign, talks about the Justice for George Floyd rally in Staunton. Staunton News Leader STAUNTON - George Hunter is one of the founders of the Shenandoah Valley Juneteenth celebration held annually at Montgomery Hall Park. The event is a celebration of the end of slavery, but Hunter said too many black people in the United States today don't feel like they're truly free. ""It feels like we're still in bondage,"" the Fishersville man said Saturday night about the black experience in America. ""Because we can't do what we want to, we can't go where we want to. If we say something, it's turned inside out. And when we try to defend ourselves, even if we don't have anything on us, we're shot and killed ... that has to stop."" Hunter was one of the speakers at Saturday's Justice for George Floyd rally in downtown Staunton. A post was made on Facebook Friday afternoon to spread the word about the rally. Please support The News Leader. Your subscription helps us continue providing important stories to the community. George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday in Minneapolis after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes. The incident was caught on camera and Floyd could be heard on the recording saying, “I can’t breathe.” Chauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Floyd’s death has sparked protests throughout the country, some of which have turned violent. In Virginia, protests have been reported in Charlottesville, Hampton Roads and Richmond. The Facebook post about Staunton’s protest indicated Benjamin Lipscomb was the person in charge. Lipscomb posted that he wanted the rally in Staunton to be peaceful, and again, before the beginning of the rally, he urged those present to remain peaceful. ""I want Staunton PD to understand that it is not enough to be neutral in times like these or in fact any time,"" Lipscomb wrote on Facebook messenger in response to a question from The News Leader about why he organized the rally. ""They must be proactive in their condemnation of brutality and transparent in their efforts to remain ethical and nonviolent."" Jim Williams, Staunton's chief of police, sent out a statement Saturday evening. That post read, in part, ""I realize that watching such a disturbing scene involving a police officer committing such an atrocity will make some people question whether something like this could happen in their own community. ""As your police chief, I would like to assure you that the men and women of the Staunton Police Department are highly motivated and well-trained, and committed to enforcing the law while treating all citizens of and visitors to the City of Staunton respectfully, fairly and impartially."" In the event that began at 7:30 p.m. and lasted a little over an hour, approximately 50 people marched from the BB&T parking lot along N. Augusta Street to the Augusta County Courthouse. Many held signs high and chanted, ""Say his name, George Floyd,"" as they slowly walked. This woman now talking from the courthouse steps. pic.twitter.com/tGlE8fOqEP — Patrick Hite (@Patrick_Hite) May 31, 2020 Once they arrived, the crowd continued to grow. By the end of the rally, the entire front lawn of the courthouse was covered by protesters. People were also on the courthouse steps and even spilled onto the sidewalk. But throughout, Hunter said he was encouraged that everyone remained peaceful, even though they spoke their minds. ""A lot of times when you see events like this, you never know what you're going to see, what to expect, what type of outcome it's going to be,"" Hunter said. ""The good thing is, there wasn't any looting, there was no busting windows. It was just a lot of people coming together, trying to hear and understand how we go forward, how we can make things better."" More: Notes from live coverage of the march in Staunton for George Floyd More: Observing masks worn and social distancing at Staunton Farmer's Market Ophie Kier, the vice mayor who was voted off of council this past election after serving since 2008, addressed the crowd. Kier lost in an election that saw four conservative members win seats, shifting the balance of power. As a Democrat and the lone black member of the council, Kier told the crowd that he looked around the crowd to ask other council members to raise their hands. ""But I only see one,"" he said, referring to Brenda Mead, who also addressed the crowd. Buy Photo Protestors marched in downtown Staunton to the Augusta County Courthouse Saturday evening.

""It can be done peacefully,"" he said. ""They're intimidated when masses show up. I am hoping that, from this day forward, we do remember George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor."" Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was shot and killed by two white men in February. Arbery was out for a run when he was killed. Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman, was shot and killed in her Kentucky home when police broke down her door in March.

""It said, 'I always wondered why somebody didn't do something about this. Then I realized I was somebody,'"" she said. ""This is somewhere to start, at least. Bring friends with me and we can discuss this. If one of us starts, it's easier for others to come and be a part of something that is bigger than themselves.""

Police ordered an end to the nighttime’s protest after someone threw a flare or firework at officers. The night protests began outside Walmart and Target at Valley View Mall and continued later with stops that included the Sheetz near the Berglund Center and several downtown streets, going by the police headquarters several times. Police report some damage at the Walmart, and city officials say why peaceful protest will be tolerated, unlawful activities will not. Earlier in the day, hundreds of protesters marched along Roanoke streets. The marchers walked toward downtown from the Gainsborough neighborhood, but once they headed down Campbell Avenue, they were kept away from walking down the middle of the street directly in front of Roanoke Police headquarters. After some tense moments, the marchers moved along the sidewalk across the street. Police said the protesters were not allowed to walk down the street since they did not have the necessary permit to do so. RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Protesters in Virginia responding to the death of George Floyd earlier this week in Minneapolis smashed windows at police headquarters and briefly shut down a major highway. In Richmond, a Friday evening protest that began at Monroe Park, near Virginia Commonwealth University, drew hundreds of people who marched through the streets chanting “no justice, no peace.” As the protest ran on, newsoutlets report a police cruiser and a dumpster near Richmond Police headquarters were set on fire. A Richmond television reporter covering the protests was struck by a thrown bottle. Later, a city bus was set ablaze. Police responded by spraying chemicals. Virginia Capitol Police said Saturday that Capitol Square will remain closed Saturday. In Hampton Roads, hundreds of protesters, white and black, marched from Fort Monroe to Interstate 64 to close the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel. They entered the highway shortly before 9 p.m. and stopped traffic in both directions, causing delays before moving on, news outlets reported. The protests in Virginia were similar to those carried out across the nation in response Floyd’s death.

Protests across the country have escalated over the death of George Floyd who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day, May 25. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) LOS ANGELES – A fourth day of violence in Los Angeles prompted the mayor to impose a rare citywide curfew and call in the National Guard after demonstrators clashed repeatedly with officers, torched police vehicles and pillaged businesses in a popular shopping district. Mayor Eric Garcetti said Saturday he asked Gov. Gavin Newsom for 500 to 700 members of the Guard to assist the 10,000 Los Angeles Police Department officers. The Guard members were expected to arrive early Sunday. Garcetti said the soldiers would be deployed “to support our local response to maintain peace and safety on the streets of our city."" Firefighters responded to dozens of fires, and scores of businesses were damaged. One of the hardest-hit areas was the area around the Grove, a popular high-end outdoor mall west of downtown where hundreds of protesters swarmed the area, showering police with rocks and other objects and vandalizing shops. One officer suffered a fractured skull, Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said. When the curfew took effect at 8 p.m., police moved aggressively to get people off the streets and there was no repeat of the late-night rampage that occurred downtown Friday night and led to more than 500 arrests. Community leaders denounced the violence that has accompanied protests over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who was died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee to Floyd's neck. Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn said she lived through two previous seminal LA race riots — Watts in 1965 and 1992 following the acquittal of police officers in the beating of black motorist Rodney King — and remembers the pain the city endured. “We must stand in solidarity against the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of law enforcement,"" she said. “But please don’t destroy our beloved Los Angeles. This is not a protest anymore.” There were protests in cities throughout California, from San Diego to San Francisco. San Francisco's iconic Union Square saw people stealing leather bags from the Coach store and shoes from the Salvatore Ferragamo location, The Mercury News reported. Streets were littered with bras from Victoria's Secret and cushioned jewelry boxes from Swarovski. Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters. San Francisco Mayor London Breed said a citywide curfew would go into effect from 8 p.m. Sunday to 5 a.m. Monday. She also asked the governor to put the National Guard on standby. “People are hurting right now. They’re angry. I’m angry,"" Breed tweeted, “We can’t tolerate violence and vandalism."" San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said he understood why protesters are angry at police. But he warned that if anyone assaulted officers, “we will not tolerate that.” In nearby Oakland, which was wracked by violence Friday night that left 13 officers injured, authorities declared an unlawful demonstration near City Hall late Saturday. Protesters lit a dumpster on fire in the middle of an intersection and police launched tear gas into a crowd. In Emeryville, just east of San Francisco, Mayor Christian Patz said Target, Best Buy and other box stores were burglarized, with thieves stealing electronics and other items. Stores in the city closed early Saturday as part of a shelter-in-place order following violent protests in nearby Oakland the night before. “It’s an explosion of the frustration of the people in the community,” Patz said, “If we’re going to ask people to stay within the bounds of the law, we’re going to have to show that the law applies to everyone."" In Santa Ana, south of Los Angeles, hundreds of demonstrators converged on the police station, throwing objects and setting off firecrackers as police used tear gas to push them back. The scale of the destruction in Los Angeles was being compared to the 1992 riots, when there was more than $1 billion in property damage. There was no estimate of how many businesses suffered damage since protests began Wednesday, but it was clearly extensive. Saturday’s clashes occurred in and near the Fairfax District, where the historic center of LA’s Jewish community mixes with upscale shopping, restaurants and entertainment industry sites that draw locals and tourists from around the world. CBS Television City, the quaint Original Farmer’s Market and the luxury of the Grove are among sights. Trendy Melrose Avenue, which lent its name to the TV show “Melrose Place,” runs through the neighborhood. The rally that preceded the violence was held at Pan-Pacific Park, former site of the 1930s-era Pan-Pacific Auditorium where LA’s professional sports teams played and many of its major events were held before the city’s modern arenas were built. Through the day, crowds of demonstrators faced off with lines of police officers, or broke into businesses and stole merchandise. Patrol cars were battered and set ablaze, and several businesses burned into the night. The huge crowds gradually dissipated, but officers still pursued scattered groups and individuals. On Friday night, protesters roamed through the downtown late at night, smashing windows and robbing jewelry and other stores. On Saturday, a mostly peaceful demonstration early in the day devolved in the afternoon when protesters set several police department cars on fire, broke store windows and climbed on top of a bus. Police used batons to move protesters back and shot rubber bullets to scatter the crowd. “We cannot allow this city to spiral into anarchy,” Moore told ABC7 at the scene of one clash. Garcetti initially imposed a curfew on the downtown area. But he quickly expanded it to the entirety of the city as the violence focused on an area about 6 miles (10 kilometers) to the west. Adjacent Beverly Hills and West Hollywood followed as demonstrations spread into those cities. Other cities in the county also began imposing curfews. Social media video posts showed marchers chanting “Eat the rich"" in Beverly Hills, where a crowd broke into a high-end boutique and fled with merchandise. The governor said earlier that authorities were closely monitoring organizing by violent extremist groups who may be trying to use the protests for their own agendas. “To those who seek to exploit Californians’ pain to sow chaos and destruction, you are not welcome,” he said. “Our state and nation must build from this moment united and more resolved than ever to address racism and its root causes.” In Oakland, a federal contract security officer was killed and another critically injured Friday night when a vehicle pulled up to the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building and someone opened fire. The officers guard the U.S. courthouse as part of their regular duties and were monitoring the protest, Department of Homeland Security officials said. It wasn’t immediately known whether the shooter had anything to do with the protest. “This is not who we are,” Mayor Libby Schaaf said in a videotaped statement Saturday. “We must fight the travesty of racism, but we must do it in a way that works. Let’s not destroy or harm our own community.” The death of the 46-year-old Floyd, who was recorded on video pleading for air, has shocked the country and produced violence in numerous cities. Police chiefs and police unions have called it unjustifiable and excessive force. The officer has been charged with murder",0.0

NBC12′s Karina Bolster reports protests started out peaceful but demonstrators started to get rowdy as the night went on by spray painting buildings and other property and knocking over barricades. A Wells Fargo Bank window was also broken at the intersection of Grace and Second Street. A dumpster and a police cruiser were set on fire near the Richmond Police Department headquarters. Fireworks were also set off at one point in time during the demonstrations.

More people need to come down here and unite. We’re tired of getting killed by the cops,” a demonstrator said. At least two people were put into handcuffs near police headquarters. It is unclear why the two were detained. A protester also physically touched an NBC12 photojournalist and slapped the camera out of his hands.

For several journalists across the country, the demonstrations were taking an ominous, dangerous turn. A reporter for Gray Television-owned WIS-TV in Columbia, South Carolina, was hit in the head by a thrown rock on Saturday. She later tweeted about the experience. Miranda Parnell says a person wearing a MAGA hat showed up at the rally, protesters confronted that person. Rocks were then thrown and one of them hit Parnell. Parnell. was taken from the scene to an area hospital and is okay. Earlier, a journalist in Minneapolis was shot in the thigh by a rubber bullet. Demonstrators also broke windows and vandalized the Atlanta office building where CNN is headquartered, and police in Louisville, Kentucky, apologized after an officer fired what appeared to be pepper bullets at a television news crew with WAVE, also owned by Gray Television. Fox's Leland Vittert was rattled following the Washington attack that he said was clearly targeted at his news organization. “We took a good thumping,” he told The Associated Press. A live shot he was doing was interrupted by a group of protesters who shouted obscenities directed at Fox. Flanked by two security guards, he and photographer Christian Galdabini walked away from Washington's Lafayette Park trailed by an angry group before riot police dispersed them. Vittert said there were no markings on him or the crew's equipment to identify them as from Fox. But he said during the demonstration, one man continually asked him who he worked for. He didn't answer, but the man found a picture of Vittert on his cell phone and shouted to other protesters that he was from Fox. “The protesters stopped protesting whatever it was they were protesting and turned on us,” he said, “and that was a very different feeling.” He compared it to when he was chased away from a demonstration in Egypt during the Arab Spring of 2011 by a group that shouted, “Fox News hates Muslims.” A correspondent from the website The Daily Caller followed Vittert and the demonstrators as they left the park. At one point, someone took Vittert's microphone and threw it at his back. One woman chasing him wore a t-shirt that said, “I can’t breathe,” a reference what Floyd said earlier this week when a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck. Vittert said he was “extremely grateful” to the Daily Caller for documenting the scene; Galdabini’s camera was smashed. “They were putting themselves at risk,” he said. “It makes me proud to do my job and to be a journalist,” he said. “I'm proud to be an organization that is unyielding in our coverage. We're going to keep on telling our story and doing exactly what we're doing.” Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media, said in a memo on Saturday that Fox was taking all necessary security precautions to protect its journalists covering the story. “We are truly living in unprecedented and transformative times and freedom of the press is a vital element to the foundation of our society,” Scott wrote. On Friday, CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his two-person crew were arrested while covering overnight protests in Minneapolis. They were quickly released, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized to CNN. CNN's headquarters in Atlanta was targeted later Friday by a group of protesters who also fought with police and set cars afire. While police tried to keep them away from the CNN Center, demonstrators broke windows there and scrawled obscene graffiti on the network's logo. In Louisville, WAVE-TV was on the air covering a demonstration when video showed a police officer aiming a rifle at reporter Kaitlin Rust and her crew. She was heard yelling, “I’ve been shot! I’ve been shot!” and described them as pepper bullets. Louisville Police spokeswoman Jesse Halladay apologized for the incident, and said police would review the video for potential discipline. Demonstrators surrounded the police department headquarters in Columbia, S.C. on Saturday and a scuffle broke out with someone wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat. Rocks were thrown and Miranda Parnell, a television reporters from WIS-TV, was injured and taken to the hospital, according to a tweet from network anchor Judi Gatson. It was not clear who threw the rock that hit Parnell. In Minneapolis on Saturday, a Swedish journalist was shot in the thigh with a rubber bullet, apparently from a police gun, while covering a protest, according to the Norwegian newspaper VG. ___ AP correspondents Mike Stewart in Atlanta, Jari Tanner in Minneapolis and Bruce Schreiner and Dylan Lovan in Louisville, and Jeffrey S.

People of all races and all ages filled the streets with their chants, signs, and frustrations. “It’s sickening that we have to have these types of demonstrations in order to get a point across,” Activist Don Gathers said. ""This is a incredible show of solidarity, brothers and sisters who have been traumatized.” A large crowd could be seen in front of CPD around 3:30 p.m. Saturday, May 30. People across the country are taking part in #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd, a Minneapolis man who died earlier this week following being handcuffed and detained by several police officers. Video footage of Floyd’s arrest Monday, May 25, shows a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes and ignored his “I can’t breathe” pleas. The black man died later that day. Four officers were fired Tuesday, and on Friday, Officer Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Protesters moved away from the Charlottesville Police Department after about a half hour, marching down Market Street. “Just the mere fact that we have to do this in 2020 is astonishing to me and should be astonishing to everyone,” Gathers said. “Emotions are all over the place right now."" Gathers added that enough is enough: “We’re demanding recognition. We’re demanding to be treated as equals, and as human beings,” he said. Although the turmoil in Minneapolis is more than a thousand miles away, both Gathers and City Councilor Lloyd Snook admit that there are still underlying problems in Charlottesville. “It’s a continuous plethora of things that continue to go on in this community directly that need to be addressed,” Gathers said. Snook and Gathers point out that Charlottesville has much work to do: ""The first thing that we’re going to do is get the Police Civilian Review Board (CRB) up and functioning,” Snook said. “Putting some real teeth into Civilian Review Board, and getting behind there is just as important as anything in light of the recent situations that are going on,” Gathers added. The coronavirus pandemic got in the way of the CRB process, as it eliminated the option of in-person meetings. However, Snook expects it will start back up soon. “The government in Charlottesville understands and wants to be a part of the change,"" the councilor said. ""We’re not trying to oppose change, we’re trying to embrace it.” In order to see words turn into action, Gathers and other protesters demand the release of nonviolent offenders from the Albemarle Regional Jail, and requests that police dig into the minority report more. Gathers says they also want to see, “equal and equitable policing of all communities in this area, not just the minority communities.” The one thing he hopes the Charlottesville police take away from the demonstration is, “don’t discount our blackness, because I’m black doesn’t mean I have a target on my back. I’m still a human being.” The Associated Press contributed to this article.",0.0

(AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) NEW YORK – Street protests spiraled into New York City’s worst day of unrest in decades Saturday, as fires burned, windows got smashed and dangerous confrontations between demonstrators and officers flared amid crowds of thousands decrying police killings. A day that began with mostly peaceful marches through Harlem and neighborhoods in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens descended into chaos as night fell. Demonstrators smashed windows, hurled objects at officers, torched and battered police vehicles and blocked roads with garbage and wreckage. A handful of stores in Manhattan had their windows broken and merchandise stolen. Officers sprayed crowds with chemicals, and video showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators on a Brooklyn street, knocking several to the ground, after people attacked it with thrown objects, including something on fire. It was unclear whether anyone was hurt. It was the third straight day of protests in the city over the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minnesota, a remarkable outburst after most New Yorkers spent the past two months stuck inside as the coronavirus devastated the city. A night earlier, several thousand people faced off with a force of officers on the streets around a Brooklyn sports arena. The NYPD said at least 120 people were arrested and at least 15 police vehicles damaged or destroyed. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, blamed the destruction on a small number of agitators who he said “do not represent this city” and were purposely trying to incite violence against police. “We appreciate and respect all peaceful protest, but now it is time for people to go home,” de Blasio told reporters outside the city's emergency management headquarters just after 11:30 p.m. “What we’re seeing is people coming in from outside, a lot of them are purporting to speak about the issues of communities of color, but a lot of them are not from communities of color,” de Blasio said on the local cable news station NY1. Elsewhere in the state, the mayor in Rochester declared a state of emergency and a 9 p.m. curfew after demonstrators destroyed police cars, setting one on fire, and officers responded with tear gas canisters. Albany police used tear gas and rode horses in efforts to quell demonstrators throwing objects. In Buffalo, numerous storefronts had their windows smashed and a person tried to start a fire in City Hall. The protests in each city were all held in defiance of a statewide ban on gatherings imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus. “This is bigger than the pandemic,” said Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski, referring to the outbreak that, until recently, was killing hundreds of New Yorkers each day. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people. Cops seem as though they’ve been trained to do so.” Earlier in the day, de Blasio had expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset about police brutality, but promised an independent review of demonstrations Friday night in which a mob set fire to a police van and battered police cruisers with clubs and officers beat people with batons. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he had asked the state's attorney general, Letitia James, to lead an inquiry and make a public report. The mayor said he was upset by videos of confrontations “where protesters were handled very violently” by police, including one that showed a woman being needlessly thrown to the ground. But he defended officers in the streets, saying they were being subjected “to horrible, vile things.” Of the video of officers driving into a crowd Saturday, de Blasio said it would be investigated, but that the officers acted because they were being attacked. Violence early Saturday resulted in federal charges against three people suspected of building and throwing Molotov cocktails at police vehicles in two separate incidents in Brooklyn. The U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn said Samantha Shader, 27, of Catskill, New York, admitted under questioning to throwing her device at a van occupied by four officers. It did not ignite and the officers were unharmed, police said. Shader’s sister, Dorian, was also arrested and will face charges in state court, the Brooklyn district attorney’s office said. Colinford Mattis, 32, and Urooj Rahman, 31, both of Brooklyn, are accused of targeting a police van. They were charged under a federal statute regarding the use of fire and explosives to cause damage to a police vehicle and each face 5 to 20 years in prison if convicted. Information on their lawyers was not immediately available. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said more than 200 people were arrested and multiple officers were injured in Friday night's protests, including one who lost a tooth. Asked to comment on videos that showed officers shoving peaceful protesters to the ground and hitting people with batons, Shea said those acts would be investigated. But, he said, “It is very hard to practice de-escalation when there is a brick being thrown at your head.” “It is by the grace of God that we don’t have dead officers today,” he said. In a peaceful gathering Saturday afternoon, the Rev. Al Sharpton addressed several hundred people in Staten Island at the spot where Eric Garner died after being placed in a chokehold by a police officer in 2014. He was accompanied by Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr. Sharpton noted that Floyd, who died Monday in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee into his neck, had also fallen unconscious gasping for air. “Right at this spot is where we heard Eric Garner say what six years later was said by George: ‘I can’t breathe.’” Cuomo noted that Floyd's death was just the latest in a long list of similar deaths, and he said he shared in the outrage over “this fundamental injustice.” “But violence is not the answer. It never is the answer,"" he said. “The violence obscures the righteousness of the message and the mission.” ___ Associated Press writers Karen Matthews, Jennifer Peltz, Michael R.

The Ministry of Islamic Affairs said mosques will open to the public for prayers from May 31 until June 20, except in Mecca, with precautionary measures and instructions. (AP Photo/Amr Nabil) LOS ANGELES – In hindsight, Rosa Jimenez Cano realizes that attending a protest against police brutality was risky — and not just for the usual reasons. “This can be kind of a tinderbox for COVID,"" the 39-year-old venture capitalist said after attending a demonstration in Florida, one of many around the country sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. As more beaches, churches, mosques, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, the sudden and mass civil unrest in the United States is raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. And it’s not just in the U.S. — London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday where demonstrators violated social distancing rules. Rosa Jimenez Cano said she planned to self-quarantine for 14 days, worrying she was perhaps “irresponsible” when she attended Saturday night's protest in Miami, where she exposed herself to crowds of people. Protests over Floyd's death — the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America — have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. “There’s no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets ... it’s not healthy,"" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” ""Two weeks from now across America, we’re going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not.” The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was very concerned that the protests in the nation’s capital and elsewhere could provide fertile ground for a new series of outbreaks. Many of the protesters were wearing masks, but there were no attempts at social distancing. “We’ve been working very hard in these last eight to 10 weeks to not have any mass gatherings,” she said. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound.” Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd’s death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting “No justice! No peace!” while carrying signs reading “Justice for George Floyd” and “Racism is a global issue.” Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Sunday that he would ask Parliament for a final two-week extension of the nation’s state of emergency that is set to expire on June 7. That allows the government to keep ordering lockdown measures to control its coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 27,000 lives, many of them in overwhelmed nursing homes. “We have almost reached safe harbor,” Sánchez said. At the Vatican, Pope Francis cautioned people against being pessimistic as they emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that “nothing will return as before.” That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that “the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.” ___ Kirka reported from London and Gorondi reported from Budapest.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo) The Latest on the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck: ___ SAN FRANCISCO — The state Department of Human Resources sent a directive to close all California state buildings “with offices in downtown city areas” on Monday, a sweeping mandate that covers everything from Department of Motor Vehicles offices to those that license workers and provide health care. “After consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,” said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency. The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general’s offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. “Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,” the memo said. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. — Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon’s largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland. For much of the afternoon and evening protesters were largely peaceful, but there were reports of increased violence directed at police into the night. ___ SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported the demonstrations across the United States in reaction to the death of George Floyd, saying protesters “harshly condemned” a white police officer's “lawless and brutal murder” of a black citizen. The article, published with photos, said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting “No justice, no peace.” It also said there were demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis and that the protests were expected to grow further. ___ Several thousand people marched Monday in New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland, to protest George Floyd’s death and show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters marched from Aotea Square to the U.S. consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans such as “I can’t breathe” and “The Real Virus is Racism.” Hundreds more joined protests and vigils elsewhere in the country, on a day that was a public holiday. The protests were peaceful. Protesters said they were also standing up against police violence and racism in New Zealand. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. — More than 15 people were arrested during protests in Charlotte on Sunday night, the city’s police department said. Police said four demonstrators were arrested for assaulting officers, including one for hitting an officer with a rock. Three others were arrested on illegal weapon charges, police said. ___ KANSAS CITY, Missouri — Shortly after local officials praised what had been a peaceful protest in Kansas City, Missouri, police fired tear gas into the crowd after some demonstrators began lobbing water bottles, law enforcement officials said. A large crowd had gathered at County Club plaza and police had allowed it to slowly dissipate after the city’s 8 p.m. curfew took effect. But police used stronger tactics against the smaller crowd that remained when rocks and water bottles started flying and two television station news vehicles were smashed and set on fire. Police declared the scene an “unlawful assembly” and said the area was clear of activity by midnight. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. — Washington Gov. Jay Inslee late Sunday ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and stealing in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 for Bellevue. On Saturday night people smashed downtown Seattle store fronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. On Sunday there were break-ins and thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee’s activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. “We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,” Inslee said in a statement. “But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.” ___ WASHINGTON — Break-ins and stealing were rampant in downtown Washington and elsewhere in the city as protests over George Floyd’s death turned violent for a third straight night. Protesters broke into a branch of Capital Bank, and empty jewelry boxes could be seen scattered on the sidewalk outside a Mervis Diamonds store. After protesters broke into a La Colombe coffee shop, someone in the crowd yelled, “What are you looting a coffee shop for? You’re messing up the whole message."" ___ NEW YORK — The mayor of New York City’s own daughter is one of the nearly 790 people who have been arrested in the city since protests over the death of George Floyd began last week. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter tells The Associated Press that 25-year-old Chiara de Blasio was arrested Saturday night. An arrest report obtained by The New York Post says she refused to leave a Manhattan street ordered cleared by officers because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn’t mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. City Hall spokespeople didn’t have an immediate comment. — By Michael R. Sisak ___ AUSTIN, Texas — Police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Live television cameras on Spectrum News showed officers firing several shots into the crowd and several people on the ground. Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police. The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35. Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn’t have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred. Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence. ___ DENVER — Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of “Don’t shoot” alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before. Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters “reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.” ___ PHOENIX — Protests held Sunday night in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports. An hour before a curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, The Arizona Republic reported. “Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,” Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers’ use-of-force cases. ___ WASHINGTON — As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were “intentionally set” around the city. One was at St. John’s Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House. The church says every president beginning with James Madison, “until the present,” has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, “the church of presidents.” The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website. ___ WASHINGTON — The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — is being called in to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation’s capital, according to two Defense Department officials. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she had requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman — about 1,200 soldiers — to report. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The D.C. National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. - By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON — Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, “Who do you serve? Who do you protect?” Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men’s Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd’s death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Michael Jordan is “deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.” With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. “I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,” the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand’s social media accounts and the team’s Twitter account. “I see and feel everyone’s pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. “I don’t have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. “My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.” ___ BOSTON — A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence “criminal and cowardly” in a tweet. The nighttime destruction was a stark contrast to the several protests earlier Sunday that featured thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully. ___ ATLANTA — Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests. An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets. As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. ___ WASHINGTON — Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunker Friday, as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, some throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades just outside the executive mansion. That’s according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and confirmed by another official. The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Friday protests, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. It sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. In the days since, security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. On Sunday, the Justice Department also deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement national guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. — By Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller",0.0

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed the shootings during a late night news conference, but didn't offer any more details. Police later tweeted that no officers were involved. Protests became dangerous for a second straight night in Indianapolis as buildings were damaged, officers deployed tear gas and at least one business was briefly on fire. ___ Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence in a statement, as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. 'It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Officials in Minneapolis say they've succeeded for now in stopping the violent protests that ravaged parts of the city for several days after the death of George Floyd. Police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in to break up protests after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days where police mostly declined to engage with protesters. It also came after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard members and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. As Minneapolis streets appeared largely quiet, Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the heavy response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes. ___ RICHMOND, Va. "" The Richmond, Virginia, police headquarters was the target of protesters for the second night in a row as officers formed a barricade around the building late Saturday night. A dumpster was set afire near the police headquarters, which had its front windows broken out Friday night. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the police fired tear gas to move crowds away from the building. Several blocks away near Virginia Commonwealth University hundreds of protesters blocked streets chanting 'George Floyd,' referring to the black man who died Monday after an arresting officer in Minneapolis pushed his knee into Floyd's neck while he was on the ground handcuffed. Media reports showed video of protesters hurling what appeared to be water bottles at a police car, which moved through the crowd and sped away. A police cruiser was burned in the violence on Friday night, along with a city bus. ___ LOS ANGELES -- The mayor of Los Angeles says the National Guard will be deployed overnight to help local law enforcement quell violence in the nation's second-largest city. Mayor Eric Garcetti says he asked California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday to send 500 to 700 members of the Guard. Crowds of demonstrators have torched police cars, vandalized and burglarized stores and clashed with lines of officers. Hundreds of people have been arrested since Friday night. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Protests are continuing in Salt Lake City despite a curfew issued by the mayor and National Guard troops deployed by Utah's governor. Police officials say they are prepared to give people time to leave, but they plan to arrest people who refused to comply. What started as a peaceful demonstration Saturday against the death of George Floyd turned destructive. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. A second car was later set on fire. Police officials say six people have been arrested and that a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. ___ RENO, Nevada -- City officials in Reno instituted an immediate mandatory curfew Saturday night after protesters broke windows at City Hall and set fires. Police fired tear gas into the building, the Rene Gazette Journal reported, and a SWAT team arrived to help disperse the crowd. The fires were extinguished. In announcing the curfew in a statement, city officials asked residents to avoid the downtown area, where a 'heavy police presence' would be in force overnight. ___ RALEIGH, N.C. "" More than 1,000 people marched in downtown Raleigh on Saturday night, breaking windows as police in riot gear released tear gas and pepper spray to disburse the crowds. WRAL-TV showed video of throngs of people in front of the Wake County Courthouse, some walking with signs, others on bikes and skateboards to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis by a police officer on Monday. Protesters gathered in late afternoon marching peacefully north from the courthouse chanting 'No Justice, No Peace.' But tension grew after nightfall as some people threw rocks at windows and spray painted anti-police slogans on walls. Fayetteville Street was the focus of most of the vandalism with multiple buildings along the street having windows broken out. ___ MIAMI "" A student at Florida International University said the protest was largely peaceful with the crowd of about 500 'singing, we were doing poetry' and urging each other not to 'break windows' or hurt businesses. But when they arrived at the police station, another group of protesters also converged there and things escalated within minutes. 'There was a sniper on the roof with the police chief standing next to him and they started throwing smoke bombs to the crowd,"" 27-year-old Liseth Hatta said. 'Most of them were kids. They couldn't' have been older than 21. Everyone ran away screaming;' They tried to flee and rushed to the train station to head home, but police closed down the entrance. 'A lot of people tried to get back on the train to leave and they weren't letting us,' Hatta said. 'They basically trapped us in.' ___ ATLANTA "" An Atlanta police officer was struck by someone riding an ATV in downtown Atlanta during protests that continued despite a curfew, and police said they were still trying to determine whether the crash was deliberate. Police spokesman Carlos Campos said it happened about 10:30 p.m.; the mayor had set a 9 p.m. curfew. The officer suffered significant injuries and was in stable condition, Campos said. The ATV drive suffered minor injuries and was taken into custody, Campos said. ___ LOS ANGELES "" Police have arrested nearly 1,400 people in 17 U.S. cities as protests continue over the death of George Floyd. Floyd died Monday in Minnesota after a police officer put his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder. But the arrest has done little to quell protests across the country. Most have been peaceful. But a few have erupted in violence. An Associated Press tally of arrests found at least 1,383 people have been arrested since Thursday. The actual number is likely higher as protests continue Saturday night. ___ WASHINGTON "" The National Guard has been called out in Washington, D.C., as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's reaction to it. Hundreds of protesters converged on the White House during the day Saturday and marched on the National Mall, chanting 'Black Lives Matter,' 'I can't breathe' and 'No justice, no peace.' Police used pepper spray to try to disperse the crowd but the standoff continued. Protesters dragged away barricades and some broke up concrete to use as projectiles. At one point, a trash bin was set on fire. National Guard troops took up position around the White House on Saturday night.___ WASHINGTON "" President Donald Trump appears to be cheering on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement around the country to confront sometimes violent demonstrators joining in protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. On Saturday, the president commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' He also said police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' In a tweet, Trump said: 'Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest.' He was commenting on Twitter from the White House while crowds of protesters gathered outside. ___ NASHVILLE, Tennessee "" The mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, has declared a state of civil emergency after protesters set a fire inside the Metro Courthouse in the state's capital city. Thousands had rallied near the Capitol building Saturday afternoon to peacefully protest police brutality and racism. But things turned violent after darkness fell, with protesters breaking windows in government buildings and causing other property damage. The Tennessean newspaper says demonstrators also pulled down a statue outside the Capitol of Edward Carmack, a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who espoused racist views. Police deployed tear gas and began warning demonstrators that the protest was unlawful. Gov. Bill Lee issued an order Saturday night for the National Guard to mobilize 'in response to protests that have now taken a violent, unlawful turn in Nashville.' ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Police in Minneapolis are confronting protesters out after curfew on the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd. A group of marchers was moving north toward downtown on a city street when officers fired tear gas Saturday night. The group immediately retreated. Soon after, officers fired tear gas and moved in to push away throngs of protesters who were milling around the city police's 5th Precinct. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not more strongly confronting violent and damaging protests. Minneapolis has been the epicenter of protests since the death Monday of Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for some eight minutes. The protests have spread to cities across the United States. ___ CHICAGO "" Chicago's mayor has announced an overnight curfew in the city running from 9 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday, and she says police will crack down on any violence. Mayor Lori Lightfoot says that peaceful protesting over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has 'devolved into criminal conduct.' She says police will be aggressive with arrests for anyone caught damaging property. In the mayor's words: 'We can have zero tolerance for people who came prepared for a fight and tried to initiate and provoke our police department.' ___ MIAMI "" An initially peaceful protest in Miami over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has turned violent, with some demonstrators setting fire to police cars. Witnesses to the clash Saturday say officers responded with tear gas and fireworks to disperse the crowd. The mayor has declared a 10 p.m. curfew. At one point, Interstate 95 was shut down as protesters stood on the busy highway. Police also used bicycles to push back an increasingly rowdy crowd throwing rocks. Elsewhere in Florida, protesters in Tampa smashed store windows and set a gas station ablaze Saturday night after a peaceful demonstration during the day. Some broke into AT&T and Gold N Diamond stores. ___ Curfews are in effect or imminent in more than a dozen U.S. cities facing rising unrest following the death of George Floyd. The start times Saturday evening range from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People are being told to get off the streets beginning at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. in Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle. A curfew is in effect for a second night in and around Minneapolis, where Floyd died earlier this week after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes during an arrest. Thousands ignored the Friday night curfew and peaceful protests gave way to violence late into the night. ___ PHILADELPHIA "" Authorities in Philadelphia say a peaceful demonstration protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis later turned violence, and at least 13 police officers have been injured amid incidents of arson and store break-ins in the city's doqwntown. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw says at least four police vehicles were set ablaze and other fires were set throughout downtown Saturday afternoon. Protesters smashed windows and stole merchandise from stores as police tried to worked to corral the crowd, which Outlaw estimates numbered about 3,000. Protesters also sprayed graffiti on a statue of former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, tried to topple it and set a fire at its base. Rizzo was Philadelphia's mayor from 1972 to 1980 and was praised by supporters as tough on crime but accused by critics of discriminating against minorities. Authorities in Philadelphia have ordered a citywide curfew has been implemented from 8 p.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday. ___ SALT LAKE CITY "" Utah Gov. Gary Herbert has activated the Utah National Guard after protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent during a demonstration at which some participants carried rifles in Salt Lake City. Herbert says in a tweet that the Guard will help control 'the escalating situation' in the downtown area following the unrest Saturday afternoon. The protest started out peacefully, but degenerated into violence. A group of people flipped over a police car and lit it on fire. Some demonstrators smashed eggs and wrote graffiti on the walls of the Salt Lake City police station. Others marched through downtown to the state Capitol. Some people in the protest openly carried rifles, which is legal in Utah. ___ LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has imposed a downtown curfew for Saturday night after some protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent. With protesters were back out Saturday, Garcetti said everyone must be off down town streets by 8 p.m. and stay away until 5:30 a.m. Several police cars were torched Saturday afternoon as some protesters ignored authorities' call for peaceful demonstrations. That followed a night of violence during which people smashed windows, robbed stores and set fires. Los Angeles police reported arresting 533 people during the night. ___ SEATTLE "" The Washington State Patrol has closed Interstate 5 in both directions through downtown Seattle after a protest over the death of George Floyd spilled onto the freeway. Thousands of people gathered in the downtown area Saturday for a largely peaceful demonstration, but some protesters turned rowdier as the afternoon worn on. Police used pepper spray on the demonstrators and deployed flash bang devices. Police said arrests were made but an exact figure wasn't available. State patrol Chief John Batiste said in a statement that 'the freeway is not a safe or appropriate place for demonstration.' ___ ATLANTA "" A crowd has gathered in Atlanta to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and some people have started throwing objects at officers guarding the Georgia governor's mansion. Hundreds of people stood on a residential sidewalk Saturday evening across the street from the mansion in the city's affluent Buckhead neighborhood. Cars and motorcyclists continued to sporadically drive by in front of the demonstrators. Authorities responded by taking at least one person into custody. Gov. Brian Kemp was not inside the home Saturday evening. Earlier in the day, Atlanta's mayor announced a curfew will be in effect in the city from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday. That order followed a night of violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over Floyd's death. ___ MINNEAPOLIS "" Several Minneapolis City Council members are asking Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to appoint the state's attorney general as a special prosecutor in the death of George Floyd. Six of the council's 13 members say they support a call from Floyd's family for Attorney General Keith Ellison to handle the prosecution of the police officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck Monday. The council members say they don't think Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has the public trust necessary for the job. Freeman on Friday charged now-fired officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder in Floyd's death. Chauvin is white; Floyd was black. The council members say Freeman waited too long in bringing charge. They say Ellison, who is black, is best qualified to handle the case. They also cite a working group he helped lead on deaths involving police. ___ WASHINGTON "" Several hundred people shouting 'Black Lives Matter' and 'I can't breathe' have converged on the White House for a second straight day to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump's response. Trump earlier on Saturday belittled the protesters and he pledged to 'stop mob violence.' Speaking in Florida after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket, the president said: 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos are the missions at hand.' Three lines of barricades separate protesters from a loose line of uniformed police officers at Lafayette Park, across from the White House. At one point, the protesters left the park, chanting as they marched up a nearby street. A block from the White House, they held a moment of silence and brief sit-in. ___ ATLANTA -- Atlanta's mayor has announced a curfew will be in effect from 9 p.m. Saturday to sunrise Sunday following violence that erupted in the city during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the curfew during a news conference Saturday evening. She called it a 'very unusual and extreme step' after the violence that rocked Atlanta during Friday night. Several other cities across the nation have order curfews following unrest surrounding demonstrations protesting Floyd's death. Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. In Friday's protests, some demonstrators smashed police cars and spray-painted the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters downtown. Police say at least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests as protesters shot at officers with BB guns and threw bricks, bottles and knives. Atlanta officials said crews were temporarily unable to reach a fire at a restaurant because of crowds of protesters. ___ NEW YORK "" Protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have returned to the streets of New York for a third straight day as Mayor Bill de Blasio pleads for calm after a demonstration in Brooklyn the previous night descended into chaos that left people bloodied and vehicles burned. On Saturday, a large crowd marched through Harlem, chanted outside a police precinct and then blocked traffic on the highway along Manhattan's East River. Demonstrations of several thousand at Union Square and outside Brooklyn's Prospect Park appeared mostly peaceful. Late in the day, protesters in Brooklyn confronted police, who shoved some of the demonstrators and used an irritating chemical spray. De Blasio expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset over police brutality, but promised an independent review of the Friday night confrontation in which both protesters and police officers engaged in violence. The mayor said he was upset by videos of the clashes in which 'protesters were handled very violently' by police and by reports that a state senator and member of the state Assembly were among the people sprayed with irritating chemicals by officers. ___ CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla "" President Donald Trump says he will not tolerate mob violence during demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The president made the comment as he spoke in Florida after watching the successful launch of a SpaceX rocket Saturday. He turned his attention to the unrest in American cities following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis before he congratulated NASA and others involved in the space mission. Trump says the rule of law is the crown jewel of the country and that 'my administration will stop mob violence and we'll stop it cold.' Trump says that 'I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred. Justice not chaos are the missions at hand.'",0.0

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. "" In Indianapolis, police were investigating 'multiple shootings' downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. "" In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. "" In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. "" In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. "" In Los Angeles, protesters chanted 'Black Lives Matter,' some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. "" And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. 'The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. 'We don't tolerate excessive use of force,' Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. 'The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,' said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. 'It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.' Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to 'quell this situation.' Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. 'l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: 'Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring 'No games!' and saying police in New York City 'must be allowed to do their job!' Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. 'The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,' Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an 'invisible enemy.' The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. 'Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. 'Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice.' This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would 'have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.' Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0
1621417961,2020-05-31 05:03:23,‘We’re sick of it’: Anger over police killings shatters US,https://www.wsls.com/news/national/2020/05/31/were-sick-of-it-anger-over-police-killings-shatters-us/,en,False,,90694,wsls.com,http://www.wsls.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS – Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets across America again Sunday, with peaceful demonstrations against police killings of black people overshadowed by unrest that ravaged cities from Philadelphia to Los Angeles and flared near the White House. City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry — boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. “They keep killing our people,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. “I’m so sick and tired of it.” But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it “really shocking to watch.” In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” Among in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said. ___ Morrison and Sullivan reported from Minneapolis.

At least one person is dead after being shot in Indianapolis. Police are investigating whether the incident was connected to demonstrations in the city. In Los Angeles, protesters blocked the 110 freeway downtown and were seen breaking windows of stores at The Grove mall. Floyd, 46, died after being arrested in Minneapolis on Monday. A video shows a police officer kneeling on his neck for at least seven minutes while Floyd is heard saying he cannot breathe. That police officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers were present but have not been charged. All four were fired. Overnight curfews were enacted in cities nationwide — including Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Louisville, San Francisco and Denver — as authorities sought to stem any violence. The National Guard was also activated in several states, including Texas, Georgia, Washington, Ohio and Kentucky. Law enforcement began to make arrests in Minneapolis after an 8 p.m. curfew as crowds gathered at the 5th Precinct police building. Paul Schnell, the state corrections commissioner, said at a Saturday night press conference that an official count of arrests was not yet available but that authorities were ""committed to do whatever it takes to bring order.""

Police Chief Randal Taylor said at a press conference that authorities were still investigating the incident's connection to ongoing demonstrations in the city. ""Downtown is not safe at this time,"" Taylor said. He urged residents who do not live in the area to leave. Mayor Joe Hogsett called the day's protests ""successful"" in a tweet, but condemned the ""small group of people"" that grew violent later in the night.

A curfew began at 8 p.m. PT and is expected to end at 5:30 a.m. local time. The LAPD said hundreds of protesters were arrested amid the protests. An unlawful assembly was declared in the the Mid-Wilshire area and businesses were asked to close. Protesters blocked the 110 freeway in downtown LA and videos taken at protests showed looting and broken windows at stores in The Grove mall. Garcetti urged protesters to ""take a breath"" and ""step away"" at a press conference. He asked residents to go home and protest peacefully at a later time.

One, started at 3 p.m. in Washington Park and remained peaceful. The other, began at about 7 p.m. on Saturday at the Valley View Walmart. The store had an emergency early shutdown around that same time and there was damage done to a window there. Then, the group walked to the nearby Target, which also had an emergency shutdown. There, one person was arrested. Roanoke Police Chief Sam Roman and Mayor Sherman Lea were also there. This is what the mayor’s message to protestors. “We want to make sure it doesn’t get out of hand and we think things got ugly at Walmart and we’re going to keep working and bringing in support,” said Lea. From there, protesters drove to Burlington on Hershberger Road and then went to the Sheetz across from the Berglund Center. While there, protesters chanted, “hands up don’t shoot” Private security tried to keep peace and protesters left there at about 10 p.m. The group then moved into downtown where they spent four hours protesting. Police allowed them to protest throughout streets as long as they were peaceful. At that time, police were protecting their station downtown, the courthouse and the jail. The protest ended when someone hurled a firework at officers and the gathering was declared an unlawful assembly.",0.0

Protesters demonstrate against the death of George Floyd, a black man who was in police custody in Minneapolis, Friday, May 29, 2020, in New York. (Source: AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) “This can be kind of a tinderbox for COVID,"" the 39-year-old venture capitalist said after attending a demonstration in Florida, one of many around the country sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. As more beaches, churches, mosques, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, the sudden and mass civil unrest in the United States is raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. And it’s not just in the U.S. — London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday where demonstrators violated social distancing rules. Rosa Jimenez Cano said she planned to self-quarantine for 14 days, worrying she was perhaps “irresponsible” when she attended Saturday night's protest in Miami, where she exposed herself to crowds of people. Protests over Floyd's death — the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America — have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. “There’s no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets ... it’s not healthy,"" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” ""Two weeks from now across America, we’re going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not.” The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was very concerned that the protests in the nation’s capital and elsewhere could provide fertile ground for a new series of outbreaks. Many of the protesters were wearing masks, but there were no attempts at social distancing. “We’ve been working very hard in these last eight to 10 weeks to not have any mass gatherings,” she said. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound.” Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd’s death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting “No justice! No peace!” while carrying signs reading “Justice for George Floyd” and “Racism is a global issue.” Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Sunday that he would ask Parliament for a final two-week extension of the nation’s state of emergency that is set to expire on June 7. That allows the government to keep ordering lockdown measures to control its coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 27,000 lives, many of them in overwhelmed nursing homes. “We have almost reached safe harbor,” Sánchez said. At the Vatican, Pope Francis cautioned people against being pessimistic as they emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that “nothing will return as before.” That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that “the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.” ___ Kirka reported from London and Gorondi reported from Budapest.

Virginia Delegate Lee Carter (D-Manassas, Bristow) announced on Twitter tonight that he was sprayed with CS gas (tear gas) by a Virginia State Police officer at a protest on Sudley Road. Carter also alleged that police tried to hit him with a flashbang as he walked away from them. “Virginia State Police sprayed CS directly into my left eye after refusing to answer basic questions for 45min…. They tried to flashbang me again while I was walking away. Twice. They missed. I saved the hand thrown container,” tweeted Delegate Carter. They tried to flashbang me again while I was walking away.

Carter (@carterforva) May 31, 2020 Police used CS gas on Carter after Facebook Live video showed the delegate in a faceoff with police in riot gear while standing on the corner of Sudley Road and Sudley Manor Drive, the site of the protest near Manassas. Virignia State Police told Potomac Local News, “in an effort to safely disperse the violent crowd, state police has utilized non-lethal tactics, such as OC ‘pepper’ spray and powder.” Prince William police, the first agency on the scene, did not use so-called non-lethal tactics, department spokesman Jonathan Perok told Potomac Local News. Protestors who spoke with, as well as videos and photos obtained by Potomac Local News, show that rubber bullets and tear gas were fired at what was estimated to be 100-300 protestors, many of whom are young adults and teenagers. It’s unclear who fired the rubber bullets. “…so it all started when I raised my hands up peacefully and proceeded to walk closer to the officers I got down on one knee and repeatedly said ‘I am unarmed,’ and I heard two shots fired by someone else getting hit with one and one skimming off the side of my fingers which I bled from,” Fizan Ali, a George Mason University Student told Potomac Local News, describing what it was like being hit with a rubber bullet. Tear gas was also used on the crowd. “Since I was in front of the crowd, I inhaled some of it [tear gas] and ended up running because it was too much to handle. I started coughing and I have to rub my eyes as well. Fortunately, I wasn’t hit by a rubber bullet, but it landed near me,” said Emily Jasmine Reyes, a protestor and Stonewall Jackson High School student. “I didn’t get a full dose of it [tear gas], but enough to breathe in. It burned all the way down to my lungs, even as I walked further back. Plenty of people around me were choking and gagging,” said Amber, who asked we only use her first name for this story. The protest began peacefully with little to no police present, but the atmosphere changed at 8:10 p.m. when an unidentified individual threw an unknown object at a driver. Police, who were staged at nearby Bull Run Library, issued a Signal 1, prompting officers to swarm the intersection of Sudley Manor and Sudley Road to put down what the Prince William County Police Department called civil unrest. Hours into the incident, protesters continued to hurl rocks and bottles at police from the parking of a nearby Red Lobster restaurant. Prince William police brought Mulitple paddy wagons from its Eastern District (Garfield) Police Station on Route 1 in Woodbridge to the site of the protest, where several protesters were rounded up at the Manassas Campus of Northern Virginia Community College and were arrested. It’s unclear how many people were arrested during Saturday evening’s protest. In the early phase of the civil unrest, police closed portions of Sudley Road, between Sudley Manor Drive and Interstate 66. Virginia State Police were called to shut down the highway interchange to prevent drivers from exiting toward Manassas. Manassas City police also assisted in controlling the crowd. Cities across the nation erupted in protest Saturday night in the wake of the death of George Floyd, 46, who was killed on May 25, 2020. Video shows a Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, placing his knee on Floyd’s holding him down on the ground during an arrest attempt. Video captured by onlookers captured Floyd saying “I can’t breathe,” and “please don’t kill me” in the final moments of his life. Four officers, including Chauvin, were fired from the Minneapolis police force. None have been convicted in Floyd’s death. An FBI investigation is ongoing. Saturday night’s nationwide protests, unofficially and effectively, marked an end to strict social distancing measures that were voluntarily and widely observed by U.S. citizens after President Donald Trump shut down the country 79 days ago at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.",0.0

(WRIC) — Richmond experienced three nights of protests and riots this weekend resulting in the destruction of property, looting, fires and arrests. The protests were in response to the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video being pinned down by three Minneapolis police officers while in custody. One officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on Floyd’s neck as he continuously yelled in distress. Chauvin was fired for his actions and has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Nationwide outrage at the event led to protests and riots in cities across the nation, including Richmond. In a press conference on Sunday, Richmond Police Chief William Smith said that police are looking into whether or not people from outside of the area had traveled to Richmond for the riots and were responsible for instigating some of the violence. Friday night protest leads to a riot that lasted into early Saturday morning A GRTC Pulse bus was burnt during the first night of protests and riots in Richmond. On Friday evening, what started as a peaceful protest turned into a riot in downtown Richmond. As a result of the violence, stores were looted, buildings around Capital Square were damaged and a police car and GRTC Pulse bus were set on fire. In response to the riot, Capital Square was closed to the public on Saturday and GRTC started service late on Saturday, and then later suspended service from 8 p.m. Saturday through Sunday night. While no one was injured during the bus burning, GRTC said it didn’t want tot take any chances. “The safety of our staff and passengers is the most important factor in determining service levels. We can replace property, but we can’t replace people,” said Julie Timm, GRTC Chief Executive Officer. Mayor Levar Stoney condemned the violence saying “two wrongs don’t make a right.” “We welcome folks to come and peacefully protest and peacefully demonstrate,” Stoney said on Saturday. “However, what I was taught as a young man, which still follows me to this day, is that two wrongs don’t make a right. Two wrongs do not make a right. The injustice that occurred to George Floyd and others — that is wrong. The destruction of property, the damage to property — that is wrong as well. Two injustices don’t make a right. That doesn’t create justice.” Capital Square was closed after buildings around it were damaged during Friday night’s riots and protests, Saturday, May 30. On Saturday, protests again led to riots that lasted into Sunday morning Saturday night’s demonstration again devolved into riots with fires around the city and hundreds of people marching along Broad and Belvidere streets holding signs and chanting. The Saturday night riot was the largest of the three nights. Capital Police told 8News that two officers were taken to VCU Medical Center on Saturday night for leg injuries after they were struck by objects thrown by people gathered outside of Capital Square’s main gate shortly after 9 p.m. One officer was hit by a baseball bat and the other by a beer bottle. Police sources also told 8News that Wells Fargo on E. Grace Street near Richmond Police Headquarters was broken into. And according to reports, the windows at Boost mobile on W. Broad Street were smashed as well. This dumpster fire was near the corner of E. Grace and 3rd streets, Saturday, May 30. Around 11:30 p.m., a dumpster fire was reported at Brandt and Rhoads Hall at VCU. The United Daughters of the Confederacy headquarters on Arthur Ashe Boulevard was also vandalized with graffiti that said “F-ck 12” and “police are creepy.” The United Daughters of the Confederacy headquarters, Saturday, May 30.

Protesters march in Richmond Sunday night after 8 p.m. curfew, police made arrests Protests continued through Sunday evening past the 8 p.m. curfew that Governor Ralph Northam established based on Mayor Stoney’s recommendation. The Richmond Police Department arrested people for breaking curfew. Tear gas was seen in the video below being thrown into a group of people at Monroe Park adjacent to Virginia Commonwealth University’s campus. While covering the events on Sunday night, Roberto Roldan, a journalist from Virginia Public Media, said he was tear gassed after showing his press credentials to police and yelling, “I am with the press.” For the record this was not just my experience.

The massive protests sweeping across U.S. cities following the police killing of a black man in Minnesota have elevated fears of a new surge in cases of the coronavirus. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) LOS ANGELES (AP) — The mayor of Atlanta, one of dozens of U.S. cities hit by massive protests in recent days, has a message for demonstrators: “If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week.” As more beaches, churches, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, civil unrest in the United States over repeated racial injustice is raising fears of new coronavirus outbreaks in a country that has seen more infections and deaths than anywhere else in the world. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms warned that “there is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” Violent protests over the death of George Floyd have shaken the country from New York City to Minneapolis, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some protests have turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores burned and torched cars in the streets. City officials have ordered overnight curfews to quell the violence. Floyd, a black man, died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck. It was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in America. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks. “Whether they’re fired up or not, that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. The Minnesota health commissioner warned that the protests are almost certain to fuel new infections. “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. Even for the many protesters wearing masks, those don’t guarantee protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. On Sunday, many Americans were returning to in-person church services for the first time in many weeks as some emergency measures are lifted and mosques reopened across the Middle East, but in countries from India to Colombia the number of new infection was still on the rise. In Europe, unions in Paris flouted a ban on large gatherings Saturday to protest the dire conditions facing workers in the country illegally. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and said they had banned the march due to health risks. Hong Kong police have used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to break up protests in recent weeks. A ban on gatherings of more than eight people has been extended to June 4, the day of an annual candlelight vigil to mark the Chinese military’s 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. More than 6 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, tens of thousands of mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories that had been allowed to operate must close. The area has reported more nearly 2,500 infections and hospitals are reaching their limits. Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday, but without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. But England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation remained precarious. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 deaths in the pandemic, the second-highest number of confirmed virus deaths after the United States. “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment,” he said. “We have to get this right.” Pope Francis, meanwhile, cautioned against pessimism as people emerge from coronavirus lockdowns.

(AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Another night of unrest in every corner of the country left charred and shattered landscapes in dozens of American cities Sunday as years of festering frustrations over the mistreatment of African Americans at the hands of police boiled over in expressions of rage met with tear gas and rubber bullets. Cars and businesses were torched, the words “I can’t breathe” were spray-painted all over buildings, a fire in a trash bin burned near the gates of the White House, and tens of thousands marched peacefully through city streets to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. His death is one of a litany of racial tragedies that have thrown the country into chaos amid the coronavirus pandemic that has left millions out of work and killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S., including disproportionate numbers of black people. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” People set fire to police cars, threw bottles at police officers and busted windows of storefronts, carrying away TVs and other items even as some protesters urged them to stop. In Indianapolis, police were investigating multiple shootings, including one that left a person dead amid the protests — adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, mostly peaceful protests turned late Saturday and six officers hit with rocks and fireworks were injured. Police have arrested at least 1,669 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. The damage in U.S. cities came as many Americans plan to return to in-person church services on Sunday for the first time in several weeks since the pandemic forced a ban on large gatherings. Pastors in pulpits across the country will likely be urging peace amid the rubble of riots. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. But not all protests were marred by violence. In Juneau, Alaska, local police joined protesters at a rally in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city’s waterfront. “We don’t tolerate excessive use of force,” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told a gathering where most people wore masks and some sang Alaska Native songs. The show of force in Minneapolis came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,” said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong.” ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

(WRIC) — Daylight revealed burned and looted buildings after Richmond’s second night of riots. What started on Friday and Saturday as peaceful protests devolved again into vandalism across the city. The protests are in response to the death of George Floyd, who was seen last week on video being pinned down by three Minneapolis officers while in police custody. One officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on Floyd’s neck as he continuously yelled in distress. Saturday night, fires were set across the city including at stores on W. Broad Street near Lombardy Street.

(WRIC/WFXR) — Mayor Levar Stoney announced Richmond would implement an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew in the City of Richmond starting Sunday, May 31, after two nights of protests and riots. Stoney did not say how long the curfew would last and added Gov. Ralph Northam has also made National Guard troops available to the city. “I think it’s time we say enough is enough and this must end,” he said. Over the last two nights, protests turned to riots as demonstrators damaged property around the city, set fires, and even shot a man. Stoney said the violence and destruction across the city is not the Richmond he knows. “We saw local business, some black-owned businesses, that have served Richmond for decades vandalized and looted … bricks have flown through the windows of a synagogue,” Stoney said. The mayor said when people block firefighters from entering a person’s home, destroy property, and more, it serves as “an insult to the cause. We all know what happened in Minneapolis. Those actions are an insult to the cause.” In addition, Stoney said people looting stores and burning buses was an insult to George Floyd’s memory and was not progress for black America. “Don’t kid yourself,” the mayor said. Richmond Police Chief William C. Smith said the protests have started out peaceful each night and turned violent. He said the people who come to peacefully protest leave when the violence begins. Smith added Friday night’s protests involved a bigger crowd and were much more peaceful.

He said they managed to save everyone.

That is unacceptable to me, that is unacceptable to the Richmond Police Department,” Smith said. Stoney said he was thankful to the Richmond Police Department, Richmond Fire Department, and Richmond Ambulance Authority for serving the community during these riots. The protests and riots were in response to the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video being pinned down by three Minneapolis officers while in police custody.

(WRIC/WFXR) — Richmond experienced two nights of protests and riots on Friday and Saturday resulting in destruction of property, looting, and fires. The protests are in response to the death of George Floyd, who was seen last week on video being pinned down by three Minneapolis officers while in police custody. One officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on Floyd’s neck as he continuously yelled in distress. Following the nationwide outrage, Chauvin was fired and has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Here’s what has happened in Richmond: Friday night protest leads to a riot that lasted into early Saturday morning On Friday, May 29, what started as a peaceful protest turned into a riot. As a result of the violence, stores were looted, buildings around Capitol Square were damaged, and a police car and GRTC Pulse bus were set on fire. A GRTC Pulse bus was set on fire at the intersection of West Broad Street and Belvidere Street during the protest in Richmond on Friday, May 29. There were no GRTC injuries during the incident. In response to the riot, Capitol Square was closed to the public on Saturday, May 30, In addition, GRTC started service late on Saturday and then suspended service from 8 p.m. Saturday through the following night. While no one was injured during the bus burning, GRTC said it didn’t want to take any chances. “The safety of our staff and passengers is the most important factor in determining service levels. We can replace property, but we can’t replace people,” said Julie Timm, CEO of GRTC. Mayor Levar Stoney condemned the violence, saying “two wrongs don’t make a right.” Broken window on 8th and Grace Street. “We welcome folks to come and peacefully protest and peacefully demonstrate,” Stoney said on Saturday. “However, what I was taught as a young man, which still follows me to this day, is that two wrongs don’t make a right. Two wrongs do not make a right. The injustice that occurred to George Floyd and others — that is wrong. The destruction of property, the damage to property — that is wrong as well. Two injustices don’t make a right. That doesn’t create justice.” On Saturday, protests again lead to riots that lasted into Sunday morning Saturday night’s demonstration again devolved into riots with fires around the city with hundreds marching along Broad and Belvidere Streets, holding signs, and chanting. Capitol Police Told 8News that two officers were taken to VCU Medical Center Saturday night for the treatment of leg injuries after they were struck by objects thrown by people gathered outside of the main gate to Capitol Square shortly after 9 p.m. One officer was hit by a baseball bat and the other by a beer bottle. Police sources told 8News that Wells Fargo on E. Grace Street near Richmond Police Headquarters was broken into. In addition, according to reports, the windows at Boost Mobile on W. Broad Street were smashed as well. This dumpster fire ignited on Grace & 3rd Street Around 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, reports came in of a dumpster fire developing at Brandt and Rhoads Hall at VCU.

(AP Photo/Noah Berger) U.S. retailers large and small have closed some of their stores across the country because of disruptions caused by the widespread street protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Target, CVS, Apple and Walmart all said Sunday that they had temporarily closed or limited hours at some locations for safety reasons. In some places, their stores have been burned, broken into or looted as protests turned violent. Amazon said Sunday that it has adjusted its routes and suspended deliveries to keep its drivers safe in some cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Minneapolis. A spokeswoman, Kelly Cheeseman, said Amazon is also abiding by local curfews that have required people to remain off streets after a specified hour at night. Small businesses, too, are surveying the damage or trying to determine how to operate amid the chaos. Ammar Aref, who owns a corner grocery store in Minneapolis blocks from where Floyd was killed, said he has stayed opened every day, but he doesn't know how much stock to order and his employees don't want to come to work. He boards up his windows every night. Target, which is based in Minneapolis, said it has closed six stores for an extended period. Some of the worst damage was seen at its Lake Street store near where Floyd was killed. Footage showed people walking away with merchandise as smoke filled the store. The company said Sunday it was boarding up the store. Target said it hopes to reopen the Lake Street store by the end of this year. Another of its stores in Minneapolis remains closed, along with stores in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Chicago and Oakland, California. At more than 200 of its stores, Target said it had either adjusted hours or temporarily closed over the weekend, though most of the stores were scheduled to reopen Sunday or Monday. Walmart said it closed hundreds of stores late Sunday afternoon to protect employees and customers. Scott Pope, a spokesman, said several dozen stores were closed all day Sunday because of damage from protests. He said he didn't know when those stores would be able to reopen. CVS didn't say how many stores it closed but said it shuttered locations are in more than 20 states and the District of Columbia. A spokeswoman said pharmacies at closed stores will reroute customers to a nearby CVS so they can get prescriptions filled. “We are continually monitoring protests as they occur in the communities we serve and will close stores, if needed, to help ensure the safety of employees and customers,” CVS said in a statement. Apple said it decided to keep some of its stores closed Sunday. It didn't say how many were affected. Floyd, who was black, died while being arrested by Minneapolis police for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill on May 25. Cellphone video showed that a white officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd, who was handcuffed, pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. Chauvin now faces murder and manslaughter charges. The three other officers who took part in the arrest were fired but haven't been charged. Target said employees at stores that are closed will be paid for up to 14 days, including premiums that they are earning because of the coronavirus pandemic. They will also be able to work at Target locations that remain open. “We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,” Target said in a statement. “Our focus will remain on our team members’ safety and helping our community heal.” ___ AP Writer Stephen Groves contributed from Minneapolis.",0.0

According to police, the demonstration, which reportedly began around 5 p.m., started peacefully as protesters exercised their right to assemble uninhibited by police. The purpose of the original protest was a response to police brutality in the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis Police Officer on May 25. People gathered first near the Bull Run Plaza, carrying signs declaring “Black Lives Matters,” and other messages against Police violence towards civilians. However, as the evening progressed, the crowd grew and some engaged in destructive and violent behavior. “The crowds increased significantly and became violent as some of the protesters proceeded into Sudley Road, stopping traffic, and throwing objects at passing motorists and officers,” Prince William spokesperson Sgt. Perok said. “Some of the protesters were also observed standing on top of motorist’s vehicles that were stopped as a result of the obstruction and atop businesses in the area.” As the protest transitioned to become unruly, police declared it an “unlawful assembly.” Police asked residents to avoid the area. Prince William County Officers, with assistance from the Virginia State Police, attempted to regain order as crowds were estimated at approximately 250 during its peak police said. As a result, Sudley Road was closed from the I-66 interchange to Sudley Manor Drive. “At several points during the incident, the unlawful assembly declaration was repeated, and the crowds were given the opportunity to disperse peacefully,” Perok said. Additional officers from the Sheriff’s Office, Manassas City Police, Fairfax County Police, and Haymarket police were also called to assist in a support capacity during the unrest. On May 31 at approximately 1 a.m., crowds dispersed, and order was restored in the area. “During the protests, multiple businesses along the Sudley Road corridor sustained damage and two small fires were reported to shrubbery and a trash receptacle,” said Perok. “Numerous police vehicles were also reportedly damaged throughout the evening.” Citizen photos show that some businesses along Sudley Road had their windows broken. Four Prince William County police officers were injured during the unrest, according to Perok, “one sustaining a significant head injury requiring treatment at an area hospital.” “In total, five arrests were made, including the driver of a vehicle charged with DUI and other offenses for driving through a police perimeter, nearly striking officers posted at the location.” The other charges placed as a result of the disturbance included unlawful assembly and obstruction of justice. A significant number of officers assisted during the approximate five-hour unrest period following the unlawful assembly declaration. Virginia State Police released a statement saying Troopers had used pepper spray and powder to disperse crowds after people were repeatedly told to leave. Two state troopers were injured during the unlawful assembly according to spokeswoman Corinne Geller. The incident happened on the same night that people all over the country took to the streets to protest the death of George Floyd. Many of those protests also turned violent, and some were described as “riots.” Violent incidents occurred in Washington, D.C., Richmond and Charlottesville, Saturday night. 101671405_3129944107086468_1720358131189415936_n 101390708_3129944630419749_323610787727802368_n 90944354_3129944523753093_3803668624120479744_n 82200227_3129944293753116_5450207649154990080_n 82110231_3129944480419764_4481792588055052288_n 77346894_3129944217086457_3905576021822275584_n Businesses along Sudley Road that sustained damage. Photos courtesy of David Kinsella The incident took place shortly after Northern Virginia entered the Governor’s Phase I of the COVID-19 transition to “Safer-at-Home.” This was the first weekend people in Prince William and the City of Manassas were able to eat outside at restaurants that had patios or received special permits for outdoor seating. Retail stores were also able to open at 50% capacity. People said they witnessed destructive behaviors from their seats at restaurants along Sudley Road. But as Virginia had begun to open up, people were still supposed to continue to distance themselves. The Governor said that people would have to wear masks when in public places, not gather in groups larger than 10 people and social distance six feet when possible. Gathering, even peaceful protests, violate the 10 person gathering rule, but the Governor said last week that many of the issues would become a health department matter and not a police matter. Police did not respond to protests because it was a large gathering, but because it became violent and blocked the road. This article contains information provided by the Prince William Police.

Greg Abbott, R-Texas, delivers remarks during a press conference on April 10, 2020, updating the public on the state’s response to COVID-19. (Nexstar Photo/Wes Rapaport) AUSTIN — Following a string of violent protests across the state, Governor of Texas Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster Sunday. According to a release, the state of disaster was activated because the violent protests endanger public safety and threaten property loss damage. Under this declaration, Governor Abbott has the ability to designate federal agents to serve as Texas Peace Officers. “Every Texan and every American has the right to protest and I encourage all Texans to exercise their First Amendment rights,” said Governor Abbott in the release. “However, violence against others and the destruction of property is unacceptable and counterproductive. As protests have turned violent in various areas across the state, it is crucial that we maintain order, uphold public safety, and protect against property damage or loss.” Across the nation, protests are taking place in response to the death of George Floyd from Monday’s incident in Minneapolis. In Texas, protesters have called for an end to police brutality and are seeking justice in Floyd’s case. The protests have turned violent in times. In Austin, businesses were looted and vandalized as protesters set fires to buildings, cars, and other parts of the city. In Dallas and Houston, police sprayed tear gas and shot rubber bullets after protesters blocked highways. In El Paso, police headquarters were vandalized in the wake of the movement. Additional protests were staged in areas such as Amarillo and Edinburg but were completed in a peaceful manner. On Saturday, Governor Abbott activated the National Guard to assist with policing the protests. The Sunday disaster declaration is another step the governor is taking to police these demonstrations.

1621736184,2020-05-31 14:57:10,RECAP: Two nights of protests and riots in Richmond,https://www.wavy.com/news/virginia/recap-two-nights-of-protests-and-riots-in-richmond/,en,False,,70270,wavy.com,http://www.wavy.com/#spider,"RICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) — Richmond experienced three nights of protests and riots this weekend resulting in the destruction of property, looting, fires and arrests. The protests were in response to the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video being pinned down by three Minneapolis police officers while in custody. One officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on Floyd’s neck as he continuously yelled in distress. Chauvin was fired for his actions and has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Nationwide outrage at the event led to protests and riots in cities across the nation, including Richmond. In a press conference on Sunday, Richmond Police Chief William Smith said that police are looking into whether or not people from outside of the area had traveled to Richmond for the riots and were responsible for instigating some of the violence. Friday night protest leads to a riot that lasted into early Saturday morning A GRTC Pulse bus was burnt during the first night of protests and riots in Richmond. On Friday evening, what started as a peaceful protest turned into a riot in downtown Richmond. As a result of the violence, stores were looted, buildings around Capital Square were damaged and a police car and GRTC Pulse bus were set on fire. In response to the riot, Capital Square was closed to the public on Saturday and GRTC started service late on Saturday, and then later suspended service from 8 p.m. Saturday through Sunday night. While no one was injured during the bus burning, GRTC said it didn’t want tot take any chances. “The safety of our staff and passengers is the most important factor in determining service levels. We can replace property, but we can’t replace people,” said Julie Timm, GRTC Chief Executive Officer. Mayor Levar Stoney condemned the violence saying “two wrongs don’t make a right.” “We welcome folks to come and peacefully protest and peacefully demonstrate,” Stoney said on Saturday. “However, what I was taught as a young man, which still follows me to this day, is that two wrongs don’t make a right. Two wrongs do not make a right. The injustice that occurred to George Floyd and others — that is wrong. The destruction of property, the damage to property — that is wrong as well. Two injustices don’t make a right. That doesn’t create justice.” Capital Square was closed after buildings around it were damaged during Friday night’s riots and protests, Saturday, May 30. On Saturday, protests again led to riots that lasted into Sunday morning Saturday night’s demonstration again devolved into riots with fires around the city and hundreds of people marching along Broad and Belvidere streets holding signs and chanting. The Saturday night riot was the largest of the three nights. Capital Police told 8News that two officers were taken to VCU Medical Center on Saturday night for leg injuries after they were struck by objects thrown by people gathered outside of Capital Square’s main gate shortly after 9 p.m. One officer was hit by a baseball bat and the other by a beer bottle. Police sources also told 8News that Wells Fargo on E. Grace Street near Richmond Police Headquarters was broken into. And according to reports, the windows at Boost mobile on W. Broad Street were smashed as well. This dumpster fire was near the corner of E. Grace and 3rd streets, Saturday, May 30. Around 11:30 p.m., a dumpster fire was reported at Brandt and Rhoads Hall at VCU. The United Daughters of the Confederacy headquarters on Arthur Ashe Boulevard was also vandalized with graffiti that said “F-ck 12” and “police are creepy.” The United Daughters of the Confederacy headquarters, Saturday, May 30.

Grace Street. Police say the gunshot came from behind the vehicle and there is no suspect description at this time. Protesters march in Richmond Sunday night after 8 p.m. curfew, police made arrests Protests continued through Sunday evening past the 8 p.m. curfew that Governor Ralph Northam established based on Mayor Stoney’s recommendation. The Richmond Police Department arrested people for breaking curfew. Tear gas was seen in the video below being thrown into a group of people at Monroe Park adjacent to Virginia Commonwealth University’s campus. While covering the events on Sunday night, Roberto Roldan, a journalist from Virginia Public Media, said he was tear gassed after showing his press credentials to police and yelling, “I am with the press.” For the record this was not just my experience.

Editor’s Note: This is raw video. You may hear or see profanity/offensive language Protesters gathered outside the Ohio Statehouse and through downtown Columbus Saturday, demonstrating against police brutality after the death of 46-year-old George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody on Monday. Authorities say that the majority of demonstrators remained peaceful, however, some chose to act violently. Some individuals threw objects at police, break and vandalize city property, set fires to buildings and vehicles, and broke into businesses. On Sunday, the Columbus Division of Police shared a photo on their Facebook page asking for the community’s help in identifying a person of interest.

1621736173,2020-05-31 15:19:42,‘We’re sick of it’: Anger over police killings shatters US,https://www.wavy.com/news/national/were-sick-of-it-anger-over-police-killings-shatters-us/,en,True,,70270,wavy.com,http://www.wavy.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Another night of unrest in every corner of the country left charred and shattered landscapes in dozens of American cities Sunday as years of festering frustrations over the mistreatment of African Americans at the hands of police boiled over in expressions of rage met with tear gas and rubber bullets. Cars and businesses were torched, the words “I can’t breathe” were spray-painted all over buildings, a fire in a trash bin burned near the gates of the White House, and tens of thousands marched peacefully through city streets to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. His death is one of a litany of racial tragedies that have thrown the country into chaos amid the coronavirus pandemic that has left millions out of work and killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S., including disproportionate numbers of black people. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” People set fire to police cars, threw bottles at police officers and busted windows of storefronts, carrying away TVs and other items even as some protesters urged them to stop. In Indianapolis, police were investigating multiple shootings, including one that left a person dead amid the protests — adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, mostly peaceful protests turned late Saturday and six officers hit with rocks and fireworks were injured. Police have arrested at least 1,669 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. The damage in U.S. cities came as many Americans plan to return to in-person church services on Sunday for the first time in several weeks since the pandemic forced a ban on large gatherings. Pastors in pulpits across the country will likely be urging peace amid the rubble of riots. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. But not all protests were marred by violence. In Juneau, Alaska, local police joined protesters at a rally in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city’s waterfront. “We don’t tolerate excessive use of force,” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told a gathering where most people wore masks and some sang Alaska Native songs. The show of force in Minneapolis came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,” said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong.” ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0
1621736170,2020-05-31 15:21:12,Massive US protests raise fears of new virus outbreaks,https://www.wavy.com/news/national/massive-us-protests-raise-fears-of-new-virus-outbreaks/,en,True,,70270,wavy.com,http://www.wavy.com/#spider,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The mayor of Atlanta, one of dozens of U.S. cities hit by massive protests in recent days, has a message for demonstrators: “If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week.” As more beaches, churches, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, civil unrest in the United States over repeated racial injustice is raising fears of new coronavirus outbreaks in a country that has seen more infections and deaths than anywhere else in the world. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms warned that “there is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” Violent protests over the death of George Floyd have shaken the country from New York City to Minneapolis, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some protests have turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores burned and torched cars in the streets. City officials have ordered overnight curfews to quell the violence. Floyd, a black man, died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck. It was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in America. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks. “Whether they’re fired up or not, that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. The Minnesota health commissioner warned that the protests are almost certain to fuel new infections. “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. Even for the many protesters wearing masks, those don’t guarantee protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. On Sunday, many Americans were returning to in-person church services for the first time in many weeks as some emergency measures are lifted and mosques reopened across the Middle East, but in countries from India to Colombia the number of new infection was still on the rise. In Europe, unions in Paris flouted a ban on large gatherings Saturday to protest the dire conditions facing workers in the country illegally. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and said they had banned the march due to health risks. Hong Kong police have used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets to break up protests in recent weeks. A ban on gatherings of more than eight people has been extended to June 4, the day of an annual candlelight vigil to mark the Chinese military’s 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. More than 6 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, tens of thousands of mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories that had been allowed to operate must close. The area has reported more nearly 2,500 infections and hospitals are reaching their limits. Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday, but without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. But England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation remained precarious. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 deaths in the pandemic, the second-highest number of confirmed virus deaths after the United States. “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment,” he said. “We have to get this right.” Pope Francis, meanwhile, cautioned against pessimism as people emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that “nothing will return as before.” That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that “the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.” ___ Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio.

(WAVY) — Residents around the country are out in the streets to protest the death of George Floyd and the Hampton Road community is among them. Floyd was seen last week on video being pinned down by three Minneapolis officers while in police custody. One officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on Floyd’s neck as he continuously yelled in distress. Following nationwide outrage, Chauvin was fired and has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. In Norfolk Sunday, hundreds of demonstrators gathered at Martin Luther King J.

It has since reopened. The group Black Lives Matter 757 moved to the Virginia Beach Oceanfront to protest Sunday night. A growing crowd blocked parts of Atlantic Avenue in the resort city. On Friday, hundreds of people descended on Downtown Norfolk and Fort Monroe in Hampton Black Lives Matter 757 organized two gatherings in Hampton Roads Friday called “blackout757.” Both began at 7:57 p.m. One was at Fort Monroe in Hampton near the pavilion, and another was in Martin Luther King Jr. Monument Park and the surrounding area in Norfolk. The demonstration began at approximately 7:57 p.m. and the crowd moved on foot along the seawall at Fort Monroe to the gazebo. Police say the crowd eventually dispersed from the interstate but reconvened in the area of Peninsula Town Center. After marching through the streets of the Peninsula Town Center, the group made its way onto Cunningham Drive, and eventually onto W. Mercury Boulevard near the Interstate 64 interchange around 9 p.m. Their signs read “Black Lives Matter” and “No justice, no peace, no police brutality.” A livestream on the Black Lives Matter 757 Facebook page showed protesters walking eastbound near the HRBT down the entrance ramp off Mallory Street. Before the protest, Hampton Police say they reached out to the organizers prior to the event to make sure the planned demonstrations would be safe and peaceful. According to reports, the crowd split into two groups. One group comprised of Black Lives Matter 757 coordinators made its way back to the Peninsula Town Center and dispersed peacefully. The second group remained in the area of W. Mercury Boulevard. That crowd confronted officers in the Lidl parking lot who went to that area for security, and the police say demonstrators physically blocked traffic in both directions on W. Mercury Boulevard.

Four individuals, including two adults and two juveniles, were arrested for charges including assault on law enforcement and disorderly conduct. The situation was resolved just before 2:30 a.m. Hampton Police say that although they support the demonstrators’ right to peacefully protest, demonstrations that insight violence and mayhem “cannot and will not be tolerated.” Saturday evening just after 9 p.m., protesters went through the westbound side of the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth blocking traffic. The eastbound lane was already scheduled to be closed. Demonstrators started their march at 2 p.m. after a speech in front of the Norfolk Police Operations Center. Norfolk Police Chief Larry D. Boone joined the protesters and marched on the streets of Norfolk. Portsmouth Police followed the protesters who eventually made their way back to I.C. Norcom High School, where the protest began. Later in the evening, it was found that the Confederate Monument was vandalized. Latest posts",0.0

Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) LOS ANGELES – The first time officers shot rubber bullets at MSNBC host Ali Velshi and his crew Saturday night in Minneapolis, he was willing to believe that the officials didn’t know they were press. The second time, Velshi said, they knew and shot anyway. “We put our hands up and yelled, ‘We’re media!’” Velshi said. “They responded, ‘We don’t care!’ and they opened fire a second time.” Velshi, who said he was hit in the leg by a rubber bullet, is just one of many journalists across the country who sustained injuries from police or protesters while covering the George Floyd protests this weekend. And this occurred after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised that journalists would not be interfered with following the Friday arrest of a CNN crew on live television and other reports of violence against reporters from the city where Floyd died, including freelance photographer Linda Tirado, who said she is blind in her left eye after being shot at by police. Dan Shelley, the executive director and chief operating officer of the Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA), said while all the attacks on journalists were “outrageous and unacceptable"" that he was particularly upset about the Minneapolis incidents that happened after the Governor made his reassurances. “They started deliberately attacking journalists who were clearly identifiable and identifying themselves as journalists,” Shelley said. “We’ve heard a number of instances of police officers, either through their words or actions, saying that they just didn’t care. To be a journalist in the Twin Cities last night, particularly in Minneapolis, if you were just arrested, you were lucky.” Minneapolis Star Tribune reporter Chris Serres tweeted Sunday that he was twice ordered at gunpoint to hit the ground. Serres wrote that he was, “Warned that if I moved “an inch” I’d be shot. This after being teargassed and hit in groin area by rubber bullet. Waiving a Star Tribune press badge made no difference.” His Star Tribune colleague Ryan Faircloth’s car was also hit by what were “likely rubber bullets,” which shattered his window and left him with cuts on his arm and brow. Los Angeles Times reporter Molly Hennessey-Fiske said in a video message on Twitter that she and about a dozen other press had identified themselves as such and that Minnesota State Patrol officers still “fired tear gun cannisters on us at point blank range.” Hennessey-Fiske said she got hit in the leg. She said she asked the officers where they should go but they didn't give the reporters any direction. “They just fired on us,"" she said. It wasn’t just Minneapolis where reporters found themselves in harm’s way. Saturday there were journalist injuries reported in cities like New York, Chicago, Washington D.C., Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Diego, Detroit and Denver. Although the situation is fluid and developing, the RTDNA has counted more than 60 incidents across the country in the past 48 hours in which reporters have been, “injured, assaulted or harassed by either protesters or police officers.” In Chicago, Vice reporter Michael Adams had a similar interaction to Velshi and Hennessey-Fiske when police raided the gas station he and his crew were sheltering at and said they “didn’t care” that they were press. “After shouting press multiple times and raising my press card in the air, I was thrown to the ground,” Adams wrote on Twitter. “Then another cop came up and peppered sprayed me in the face while I was being held down.” Huffington Post reporter Christopher Mathais was arrested Saturday while covering protests in New York. CNN commentator Keith Boykin was also arrested by the NYPD Saturday after he identified himself as press. In Los Angeles, Lexis-Olivier Ray said an LAPD officer hit him in the stomach after he’d identified himself as a journalist “multiple times.” In Washington D.C., Huffington Post reporter Philip Lewis tweeted that he was hit in the leg with rubber bullets. Detroit Free Press news director Jim Schaefer said several of their journalists showing their media badges were pepper-sprayed by Detroit police. And in Denver, 9NEWS reporter Jeremy Jojola tweeted that he got hit with, “Something fired by police” even though he was holding a camera and lights. Sunday, he reflected that he’ll, “Never truly know if we were intentionally targeted or not. I’ll just say we were not doing anything wrong as we were in an area under curfew.” Since the protests began, eight AP journalists have been hurt, though none seriously. Three have been hit by rubber bullets, one was punched, another was knocked down and others fell. The acts of violence and deliberate harassment are further distressing to Shelley because it’s distracting from the real story. “Journalists shouldn’t be the story,” Shelley said. “It is calamitous to see all of these journalists who are merely serving the public by covering these incidents of civil unrest being wantonly attacked...Journalists are representatives of the public and are there to serve the public and to tell the stories of the protesters and of the elected and other public officials trying to deal with the situation."" He added: “It is really harming the public at large, not just the journalist. It’s interfering with their ability to be eyewitnesses and chroniclers of what’s occurring in this country right now.”",0.0

Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) NEW YORK – American religious leaders across faiths are grappling with the heavy burden of helping to heal two active traumas: rising civil unrest driven by the police killing of George Floyd and the coronavirus pandemic. Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders have raised their voices to condemn racial bias in the justice system while discouraging violence in response to the killing of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck. Those words of solidarity, for many clergy, came as their worship routines remained upended by a virus that has forced them to rely on digital or outdoor gathering. At Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Minneapolis, which has provided relief and medical help to demonstrators this week as protests roiled the city, associate pastor Angela T. Khabeb said the shared pain caused by Floyd’s death was exposing the brutal double toll being exacted on people of color. “There were other pandemics we didn’t always talk about that faced black communities, indigenous, Latinx” before the virus outbreak, Khabeb said, citing “institutionalized racism” and poverty. “And then we layer on COVID-19, which disproportionately affects black, indigenous, Latinx communities.” Khabeb acknowledged that she felt challenged by the task of tending to her congregation during the current crisis when the latest police killing of a black American had caused “a crisis of my own that’s very personal.” Rev. Raphael Warnock, senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr., preached, said during Sunday’s Livestream service that his virtual congregation needed to stay focused. “Don’t allow undisciplined provocateurs of hate who engage in looting or who tweet about shooting to highjack the high moral message,"" said Warnock, who is running for the U.S. Senate. ""Stay on high moral ground and we will win.” Among the religious leaders in Minnesota organizing for spiritual care since Floyd’s death was Bernard Hebda, the Catholic archbishop of the Twin Cities. Hebda held a Friday online prayer service “for racial justice and peace"" alongside Rev. Erich Rutten, the priest of a historic African American parish in St. Paul. The Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton also traveled to Minneapolis on Thursday, with Jackson speaking at a local Baptist church. Imam Asad Zaman, the Muslim American Society of Minnesota’s executive director, outlined multiple law enforcement reform proposals in response to Floyd’s death. Zaman noted in an op-ed this week that “the Qur’an teaches us that to save a single life is to save all of humanity.” But as the frustration sparked by Floyd’s killing scorched dozens of other cities, religious denominations nationwide began speaking out to sympathize with the pain that brought protesters into the streets. White Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder in connection with Floyd’s death, which follows the highly-publicized killings of two black Americans this year -- Georgian Ahmaud Arbery, shot while running, and Breonna Taylor, shot by police in her Louisville, Kentucky home. Seven senior members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement calling racism “not a thing of the past or simply a throwaway political issue,"" adding: “While it is expected that we will plead for peaceful non-violent protests, and we certainly do, we also stand in passionate support of communities that are understandably outraged.” The National Association of Evangelicals rooted its call for racial equality in the Bible, while Southern Baptist leaders released a statement noting Biblical teachings against “injustice and the misuse of authority and force.” One pastor planning to reopen his church for in-person worship this week, amid ongoing tension over the public health risk of physical services, said the protests show communities have a strong need for religious institutions during a time of crisis. “I think the church is essential, and I think people need church in America, and the church has got to stand against social injustice,” said Danny Carroll, of Water of Life Community Church in Fontana, California. For Rev. Jacqui Lewis, whose church plans to keep forgoing in-person worship as the pandemic goes on, spiritual comfort and social organizing can happen just as effectively online. Lewis, senior minister at New York City’s Middle Collegiate Church, urged other faith leaders to respond to Floyd’s killing by taking their sympathy from words to actions. “Grief is not enough. Prayer is not enough,“ Lewis said. “It’s a baby, first step for denominations to decry the violence. The next step is, what will you do to make sure your congregations are not racist?” This week’s protests against racial injustice came as interfaith leaders prepared to mark a national day of mourning and lament for those killed by the coronavirus on Monday, an effort backed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, part of an accompanying bipartisan congressional proposal for a civic moment of silence, said the effort to honor the dead would “show the best of what faith means in America.” The demonstrations also erupted just ahead of the Christian holy day of Pentecost and the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, both celebrated at a set time after previous holy days in the faiths. That count imbued this holy day with a more solemn meaning for Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism. Just as Jews have counted the days between Passover and Shavuot, Jacobs said, they have been “counting the dead from COVID-19, and sadly, tragically, we’re counting more black people killed in our country at the hands of law enforcement.” “We could treat all of these things as separate … but I do think there’s an intersection” given the pandemic’s outsized effect on communities already struggling with racism, he added. ___ Giovanna Dell’Orto contributed for AP from St. Paul/Minneapolis and AP writer Kate Brumback contributed from Atlanta. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews) MINNEAPOLIS – Along the miles-long Minneapolis street where more than a century of migrants have found their American footholds -- Germans, Swedes, Vietnamese, Somalis, Mexicans -- a new history can be traced. There’s the smoldering police station torched early Thursday morning by protesters enraged by the death of George Floyd while in custody. There’s the Wells Fargo bank branch a couple of blocks away that mobs stormed through the next night, leaving behind a carpet of shattered glass and strewn paperwork. “Kill Bankers” reads the graffiti now spray-painted on an outside wall. Go further up Lake Street and there’s more fresh history: the Somali restaurant with the broken windows, the empty hulk of a burned sneaker store, the boarded-up party supply store owned by a Mexican immigrant who had been praying for the coronavirus lockdown to end so he could reopen. The protests that have roiled Minneapolis night after night didn’t inflame just a single neighborhood: Much of the violence raged up Lake Street, an artery of commerce and culture that cuts across a broad swath of the city. For residents, for businesspeople, for artists, the Lake Street corridor has long been a symbol of the city’s complex history, a block-by-block study in immigration, economic revitalization and persistent inequality. On one end is a trendy district of bars and shopping. On the other are quiet neighborhoods atop the Mississippi River bluff. Between the two is a timeline that spans almost five miles marking each wave of arrivals, along with a tangle of languages spoken in each group’s markets, restaurants, churches and community groups. The Lake Street businesses owned by Suad Hassan's family are now boarded up, bearing messages like “black owned – solidarity.” Each night, the family has stood guard, successfully begging the mobs to pass them by. The 35-year-old was born in Somalia, but her family fled the country to escape war when she was a child. “When I saw the fire two nights ago, it was like a trauma that was triggered again for me,” she said. “I had put that away in my life a long, long time ago ... I told my mom ‘This is a war zone.’” It’s Lake Street's minority-owned small businesses that may suffer the most from the racial firestorm that hit the city this week. As thousands of people protested a police force with a history of violence against people of color, the collateral damage spread wide — from immigrant-owned restaurants to a center for Native American youth to an affordable housing complex under construction. “What happened with Mr. Floyd is a horror,” said Eduardo Barrera, the general manager of Mercado Central, a cooperative of largely Latino-owned businesses that helped spark economic revitalization along the street when it opened 20 years ago. The muraled corner building was broken into twice during the unrest, with some of its goods stolen. “Nothing changes and people feel they’ve lost everything,” Barrera said. “There’s nothing to lose for them anymore. When there’s no justice, no fairness and no equity, they lose hope.” “But we are hurting ourselves,” he said. Many speculate that Lake Street was hit so hard because its eastern stretch includes the station associated with the white officer now charged with murdering Floyd. The destruction is particularly painful because Lake Street had become a success story, an achievement people took pride in. Residents and business owners say they’ve spent the last 20 years working to revive its chain of neighborhoods -- many blighted by years of neglect, suburban flight and disinvestment. Deb Frank moved into the Longfellow neighborhood just off East Lake Street 25 years ago, buying a two-bedroom, 100-year-old home for $40,000. The mail carrier and her neighbors teamed up to rid the area of two brothels by calling in license plates to the police and embarrassing the patrons. Frank and her husband became used to walking to restaurants and coffee shops. “It was a really big transformation,” she said. Today, she wonders: Is it all fleeting? “It took years to get where we were and here we’re back in square one,” she said, noting even the local post office had been damaged enough to disrupt mail service. “No, we’re worse than square one.” By all accounts, immigrant entrepreneurs have been the engine of Lake Street’s repeated resurgences. The stretch, which runs east-west through the city’s south side, has long been a landing pad for recent arrivals to the city. Early in the last century, it was Germans like Emil Schatzlein, who opened a saddle shop on West Lake Street in 1907 that still sells cowboy boots today. And the Scandinavians whose imprint is still visible in the nearly 100-year-old Ingebretsen’s Nordic Marketplace, a local institution known for its lefse and herring. Today, within a couple blocks of Ingebretsen’s, you can buy a bottle of fresh camel milk in an East African grocery and fried tortillas at Taqueria La Poblanita. Just like many American cities, the 1960s saw a stream of white residents and businesses leave Lake Street for the suburbs. Buildings emptied out. By the time the Sears department store abandoned its towering building in the mid-1990s, much of the corridor was desperate for an economic infusion. “It reinvented itself as an immigrant gateway,” said Bill Convery, director of research at the Minnesota Historical Society. “The economic blight led to opportunity.” Somali immigrants fleeing war were among those who soon took advantage of the affordable rents to build businesses. Community organizations reopened the Sears building as the Midtown Global Marketplace, a showcase for food and crafts. Still, the economic progress did not erase the stubborn poverty, the racism or the striking inequality. The corridor’s neighborhoods, along with city’s north side and core, know about police tensions all too well. An ACLU study of city arrests from 2012-2014 found black and Native American people more than eight times more likely than white people to be arrested for low-level offenses. Minneapolis also has wrestled with its growing racial segregation -- a division uncomfortably illustrated by driving east on Lake Street, which begins in the overwhelmingly white, quiet and leafy neighborhoods near Uptown before shifting into largely black or mixed neighborhoods. Businesses already were suffering from the pandemic’s stay-at-home orders when the protests started. Gregorio De La Cruz, a Mexican immigrant, was just starting to reopen his two East Lake Street businesses -- a party supply and candy store, and a commercial cleaning business -- when the violence erupted. Less than a mile from the torched police precinct, he has closed shop again. “I never imagined there would be so much violence in this neighborhood,” he said, his eyes welling up as his 19-year-old daughter translated his Spanish words into English. “We understand what’s going on and we get that this is important. They have a right to protest. I wish they’d do it peacefully,” he said. De La Cruz hung a sign on his boarded-up door -- “Justicia Por Georrge Floyd” -- one of scores of pleas emblazoned on Lake Street’s plywood-lined storefronts. Two doors down, Ingebretsen’s offered another: “One Human Family.” ___ This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Wells Fargo, which had been misspelled “Well Fargo.” ___ Associated Press video journalist Noreen Nasir contributed to this story from Minneapolis.",0.0

(WFXR) — Gov. Ralph Northam announced Sunday afternoon the declaration of a state of emergency amid Virginia’s escalating violence, thus authorizing localities to receive resources and assistance from the Commonwealth to respond to recent protests. “This emergency declaration will provide the necessary support to localities as they work to keep our communities safe,” Northam announced Sunday, May 31. “There are many voices speaking out for justice and healing across the United States and in our Commonwealth, but others are exploiting this pain and inciting violence.” By declaring a state of emergency, officials can mobilize resources — including the Virginia National Guard — and preemptively send people and equipment to help deescalate violent protests in Virginia localities and protect public safety. Furthermore, Sunday’s news release says the emergency order allocates $350,000 for state and local governments, as well as state response and recovery operations authorized and coordinated through the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. In addition, at the request of Mayor Levar Stoney, Northam included in his executive order the extension of Richmond’s curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. starting Sunday and lasting through Wednesday, June 3. According to the governor’s office, while the curfew is in effect, people must remain in their homes and are only allowed to leave to seek emergency services or to travel to and from home, work, or places of worship.

Herring released a statement on Sunday regarding the death of George Floyd and the escalating protests throughout Richmond. His statement comes the same day that Governor Ralph Northam issued a state of emergency and extended the curfew for Richmond in response to the protests. “George Floyd should still be alive, and if he had been white, he almost certainly would be. We know that the criminal justice system treats people differently based on their race — the disparities are documented and undeniable,” said Herring. “It takes conscious, deliberate work to fix these problems and tear down the systems that created and perpetuate them, and that is where our focus must be. We need to move quickly to reassure Virginians that black lives matter in Virginia and must make a long-term commitment to invest in laws, policies, and training that will keep all Virginians safe,” he said. Herring continued on to address the protests and destruction that has occurred throughout Richmond in the last few days. “While peaceful protests and demonstrations can and should continue, as they are important tools of accountability and visibility, I hope we’ve seen the last of the violence and destruction that occurred in Richmond and elsewhere the last few nights,” Herring said. “It is dangerous and counterproductive, and it so quickly snatches the focus from where it should be, which is how we will come together to ensure the safety, rights, and equality of all Virginians.” In closing, he said: “In my conversations over the last few days, I’ve heard over and over again words like ‘tired’ and ‘exhausted.’ The weight of fear that our society places on the shoulders of African Americans is immoral and unsustainable.” “No one can be truly free if they live in constant fear that they, their children, or their loved ones could be killed if they go out for a walk, or run an errand, or if a traffic stop takes a bad turn.

(Doral Chenoweth/The Columbus Dispatch via AP) WASHINGTON – U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a “very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.” President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. ___ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey in Minneapolis; Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Md.; Michael R.

The announcement on Saturday from the nation's eighth-largest retailer came after Target stores in multiple cities became scenes of violence and unrest. Among the stores where aisles were ransacked was a Target in Minneapolis near the city's 3rd police precinct, where the four officers who were fired after Floyd's death worked. The 3rd Precinct police station was damaged by a fire last week. ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,"" the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. ""At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores."" A Target spokesperson said that the company is evaluating closures and limiting hours on a store-by-store basis. The majority of stores being closed are located in Minnesota and California, where protests in Los Angeles led the National Guard to be deployed. Stores will also close in Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Despite the violence that has hit its stores, the company has voiced support for demonstrators. ""The murder of George Floyd has unleashed the pent-up pain of years, as have the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote in a public letter on Friday. ""We say their names and hold a too-long list of others in our hearts."" It remains unclear whether the looting at Target stores was committed by demonstrators or whether they were the actions of unaffiliated bad actors. But the ongoing demonstrations have focused scrutiny on Target's past work with law enforcement — including partnerships with agencies in at least 2o cities. In Minneapolis, the company partnered with police on a program that helped install closed-circuit television cameras in the downtown area. A 2010 report released with support from the company said the ""genesis of the program was a widespread feeling some years ago in the city of Minneapolis that the downtown business district was not a pleasant place to work or visit.""

The president has said that members of the loosely defined far-left group Antifa — short for ""anti-fascists"" — have led clashes with police and looting in cities across the U.S. since the killing of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis. It's unclear if any group or groups are primarily responsible for escalating protests that began following George Floyd's death on May 25 as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has told the press that he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence. In one tweet on Sunday, Trump said the U.S. ""will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" It's something he has previously floated, and last year two Republican senators introduced a resolution that sought to designate the group as a domestic terrorist organization. Following Trump's tweet, Attorney General William Barr said in a statement that ""[f]ederal law enforcement actions will be directed at apprehending and charging the violent radical agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest."" Barr added: ""The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly."" The clashes, spreading to dozens of cities across the U.S., follow a series of racist incidents and deaths of black people, including Floyd's on Monday. Chauvin, now a former Minneapolis police officer, was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck while holding him in custody as Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers present at the scene have been fired but not arrested or charged. Protests and clashes that have since followed come at a time of unprecedented crisis for the country, with confirmed deaths from the coronavirus pandemic topping 100,000 and millions of people out of work as a result of broad business shutdowns. Minorities, including African Americans, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 deaths and pandemic-induced economic peril. ""The death of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis was a grave tragedy. It should never have happened. It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger, and grief."" pic.twitter.com/lirAMSv4Wo — The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 30, 2020 Trump addressed the demonstrations Saturday, striking a milder tone than he has on Twitter during prepared remarks following a space launch in Florida. He said Floyd's death ""has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger and grief."" He added that he ""understands the pain that people are feeling"" and supports peaceful protest, but that ""the memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists."" ""He should just sometimes stop talking"" Apart from Saturday's remarks, though, Trump has not often played a unifying role in recent days. His tweets about radical-left anarchists have also included criticism of Democratic leadership in Minnesota. In another tweet on Sunday, he blamed the mainstream media for fomenting ""hatred and anarchy."" Time for a change! #2020 https://t.co/AECy2GBfys — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020 On Friday, Trump tweeted provocatively that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase with a racist history that Trump said he was not aware of. Later on, he said his intent was not to make a threat but to register a statement of concern that armed violence can accompany looting. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, said on Fox News Sunday that the president's tweets about demonstrations turning violent are ""not constructive."" Speaking on ABC's This Week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Sunday morning that she's not paying attention to Trump's inflammatory tweets. Instead, she said he ""should be a unifying force in our country. We have seen that with Democratic and Republican presidents all along. They have seen their responsibility to be the president of the United States, to unify our country and not to fuel the flame."" Also Sunday, Keisha Lance Bottoms — mayor of Atlanta, one city that has seen protests and clashes with police — told CBS' Face the Nation that Trump's tweets are ""making it worse"" and ""he should just sometimes stop talking."" In his own statement on Saturday, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, wrote that ""Protesting [Floyd's killing] is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not."" He added that as president, he'd lead the conversation about turning the nation's ""anguish to purpose."" Biden made an unannounced visit on Sunday to the site in Wilmington, Del., where protests had taken place the night before. ",0.0

He said he found it hard to believe that people like him still have to fight the same battles, sing the same songs and “go through the same crap practically” on a weekly basis. “It’s not police brutality. Let’s call it what it is. It’s murder,” he said. “They continue to have them, and, sadly, once they do, juries and judges continue to let their officers off [who] are guilty.” There have been many instances where Black people have been treated differently than white counterparts while in police custody or detained, he stressed. Gathers noted Black people are shot dead in the streets during arrests, while white people are handcuffed, gently put on the ground and are offered water. “It makes absolutely no sense that’s what the struggle is about,” he said, adding that President Donald Trump has not made the situation better with his rhetoric. Referring to Trump’s comments in 2017 after the Unite the Right rally, Gathers said there are no “fine people on both sides.” There’s no such thing as a good Nazi, he explained, or a good cop who commits murder. A father of three sons, Gathers said that he has to coach his children how to behave in the presence of police is problematic. “It’s true. Black children, and specifically Black young men, you have to have a different conversation with them than white parents do with their children,” he said. Throughout the protest, Bryant and Conn said that advocacy and activism can take other forms; they urged participants to go beyond showing up to demonstrations and to be involved in the local community and government. With the gathering having begun at 3 p.m., the crowd began to dissipate by around 6 p.m.",0.0

(WFXR) — Protesters and families alike joined the march from historic Gainesville to downtown Roanoke on Saturday, working to peacefully shed light on the reality the black community faces every day. “We are laying on the ground and being brutally abused by police officers and other people just because they see us as violent, because of the color of our skin,” says 20-year-old Maria Wilson. Maria says she fears for her brother daily. “You never know what could happen when he’s out by himself because he’s a black male in this society,” Maria says. Maria’s older sister — Deasha Manns — also shares her frustration. “It shouldn’t matter about age, it should matter about this is the world we have to live in today,” says Deasha. “Do you want to live in a world where there’s hate towards a significant race.” However, their teenage brother Ryan Wimbish says he knows, “If I ever encounter a police officer I know what to do to stay safe, and I’ll do as much as I can to try to stay safe. I’ll comply with everything they say, answer all of their questions, and keep my hands on the dashboard.” WFXR News also spoke with the mother, Jacquelyn Jacobs, and she worries about what might happen to her family if following instructions isn’t enough. “As a black mother with a young, 14-year-old African American son, I’m quite frightened,” says Jacobs. “When I see what happens to these other boys, these other men, he’s not prepared to handle himself.” Unfortunately, Jacobs says racism has already come to her home, leaving her to explain to her six-year-old why an obscenity was written on their mailbox. Therefore, Jacobs says she had a talk with all of her children in order to prepare them for adulthood. “You do not hate the police, you have to know sometimes things don’t go according to plan,” Jacobs says. Now a student at UVA, Jacobs’ oldest daughter — Olivia Wimbush — refuses to be silent. “At a school like UVA after everything that’s speaking out, and there are a lot of great things that are happening, you can’t ignore the things that are not happening,” Olivia says. “I don’t think it will ever stop honestly,” Ryan says. “It’ll get better, but I don’t think it will ever stop.” Latest Stories Get breaking news, weather, and sports delivered to your smartphone with the WFXR News app available on Apple and Android.",0.0

As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry "" about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a 'very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.' President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to 'identify criminal organizers,' and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against 'violent radical agitators' who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops 'easy targets,' two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal 'kit,' meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized 'Boogaloo' movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some 'boogaloo bois' in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. 'They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,' MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump's handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency "" when he said there were 'good people on both sides' of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America's racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. 'This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,' said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. 'That's one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don't create new issues, you exploit existing issues.' There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a 'child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. ___ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey in Minneapolis; Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Md.; Michael R.

(WRIC) — After a second night of unrest and riots in Richmond, business and property owners boarded-up windows and doors along Broad Street after some took on damage from protestors, and possibly in anticipation of future discord. Power tools and pressure washers were commonly heard along Broad Street Sunday following the second night of peaceful protests that turned violence in Richmond. After businesses were looted, and property defaced for the second night, some Richmonders like Tiniesha Black volunteered to help clean up what had been left along the city’s sidewalks. Speaking of the riots, Black says “it was purposeless, it wasn’t about the cause. I feel like a lot of people came out here and here is that heart and our pain for their own personal gain.” Protests retaliating recent examples of police brutality have popped-up in many cities across the country after the death of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on Floyd’s neck during a police encounter. “I know a lot of stuff was destroyed – it’s in the crossfire between protesters and police and people that just wanted to destroy,” said David Geimecke who lives nearby, and also decided to help pick up the pieces of Saturday’s riots. Store fronts, Confederate monuments and the Daughters of the Confederacy building were covered in spray paint. The Daughters of the Confederacy building was also set on fire. Jamar Morris, of Richmond, believes attempts to protest peacefully have given disappointing results, saying, “Ain’t nothing happening, ain’t no justice being served. So, until justice gets served, we got to do what we got to do. I hate to say it like that, but that’s what it is.” During a press conference where Mayor Levar Stoney announced his request for a Sunday curfew, an emotional Richmond Police Chief William Smith recalled an incident Saturday night where protestors intentionally set fire to an occupied building, then blocked fire crews from getting there with cars. “Inside that home was a child. Officers were able to…” Smith then paused for composure. “We were able to get the fire department there safely, I’m sorry,” he said before taking a sip of water. Smith continued, “…when you take a legitimate issue and highjack it for unknown reasons, that is unacceptable to me, and unacceptable to the Richmond Police Department, and unacceptable to the City of Richmond.”     Mayor Levar Stoney says four officers and several fire fighters were inured Saturday. He also said a man suffered a life-threatening gunshot wound while in his car, that Smith said was fired by a protestor Smith indicated police have intelligence some protestors came from outside Virginia in organized effort to cause destruction, believed to be antifascists and anarchists.

1621813053,2020-05-31 18:33:42,Governor Declares State of Emergency in Response to Escalating Violence,http://bristowbeat.com/news/governor-declares-state-emergency-response-escalating-violence/,en,False,,396910,bristowbeat.com,http://bristowbeat.com/,"RICHMOND—Governor Ralph Northam today declared a state of emergency and authorized assistance to localities in response to escalating violence across the Commonwealth. The Governor granted a request from Mayor Levar Stoney to extend a curfew in the City of Richmond. “This emergency declaration will provide the necessary support to localities as they work to keep our communities safe, said Governor Northam. “There are many voices speaking out for justice and healing across the United States and in our Commonwealth, but others are exploiting this pain and inciting violence.” A state of emergency allows the Commonwealth to mobilize resources, including the Virginia National Guard, and pre-position people and equipment to assist localities in their efforts to de-escalate violent protests and protect public safety. The declaration allocates $350,000 for state and local governments and state response and recovery operations authorized and coordinated through the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. The order extends a curfew in the City of Richmond between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. from Sunday, May 31, 2020 through Wednesday, June 3, 2020. While the curfew is in effect, people must remain in their homes and may only leave to seek emergency services or travel to and from home, work, or places of worship. The full text of the emergency declaration can be found here. Prince William County At a special emergency meeting, May 31 at 4 p.m., Prince William County Board of Supervisors discussed the option to declare a county-wide state of emergency. Supervisors agreed they do not want the Virginia National Guard to come into the county, they already have the assistance of the Virginia State Police, but they would like to access funding if necessary. Lt. Col. Jarad Phelps said there were costs associated with the protest that turned to a “civil unrest” and “unlawful assembly” on Sudley Road in Manassas, Saturday night. They include overtime for officers and damage to police vehicles. Therefore, having a local State of Emergency could be useful for fiscal reasons. Supervisors wanted to make sure that calling a county-wide state of emergency would not increase police presence by calling in the National Guard or conducting things in a matter that could escalate tensions. The county executive would have to call at county State of Emergency that would then be approved by the board. The County also could not implement a curfew without the approval of the Governor as per Virginia law. No decision has been made as whether to place the county under a State of Emergency, but County Executive Chris Martino agreed to further look into the matter. It will be added to Tuesday’s agenda, unless a reason arises to act more expediently. © 2020, Bristow Beat. All rights reserved.",0.0

Camden County Police Chief Joe Wysocki, who has been working in the city for decades, joined the front line of a march in Camden on Saturday afternoon, sporting his uniform, a protective face mask and a peace sign. 'Yesterday was another example of our ongoing engagement, and a very real dialogue, that we are having with residents throughout Camden that has made our agency part of the fabric of this city,"" Wysocki said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press. Since Camden's police force disbanded and reformed in 2013 as a county agency, officers there have been hyper-focused on community policing. It's not strange to see them on walking beats or attending neighborhood block parties like the one Saturday night where two officers grilled up hamburgers and hot dogs. 'We know that together we are stronger, we know that together, in the city of Camden, we can create a space where policing is focused on deescalation and dialogue,"" Wysocki said. Protests have been held for days in cities all over the United States in response to Floyd's death. Floyd, who was black, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. On Saturday night, peaceful protests turned violent in cities like New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Store windows were smashed and items were stolen, police cars were set on fire. Both police officers and civilians suffered serious injuries. There were other instances of police solidarity throughout the U.S. widely shared on social media. Marchers in Flint Township, Michigan, arrived at a police station where Genesee County Sheriff Christopher Swanson "" responding to chants of 'Walk with us! Walk with us!"" "" said, 'Come on!' and joined the protest. Police in Fargo, North Dakota, held hands with protesters while officers took a knee in Santa Cruz, California. While Sunday afternoon in New York, officers clapped on protesters, hundreds of whom stopped and took a knee with fists raised just north of the Empire State Building. ___ This story has been corrected to show that the Genesee County sheriff marched with protesters in Flint Township, not Flint.",0.0

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a news conference that she and police Chief Erika Shields made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage of a Saturday night incident that first gained attention from video online and on local news. 'Use of excessive force is never acceptable,"" Bottoms told reporters. Shields called the footage 'really shocking to watch.' Police on Sunday night identified the fired officers as Investigator Ivory Streeter, who was hired in December 2003, and Investigator Mark Gardner, who was hired in August 1997. The video, shown on TV as captured by local reporters, shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers appear to fire a stun gun at the woman and then pull her from the car. They then use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. The couple did not appear to be fighting police. TV reporters said the police had earlier broken glass on the car and flattened the tires. Bottoms said the woman, Taniyah Pilgrim, was released without charges. She said the man, Messiah Young, was released, too, and she's ordering the charges against him dropped. She didn't specify what charges he faced. A police report says Young was charged with attempting to elude police and driving with a suspended license. The mayor said she'd delayed the news conference several hours to review all the body-camera footage because she and Shields wanted to be certain about what happened. 'I really wanted to believe that the body-worn camera footage would provide some larger view that could better rationalize why we got to this space,' Shields said. 'And having spent most of the afternoon with the mayor, reviewing the footage exhaustively, I knew that I had only one option, and that is to terminate the employees.' Bottoms said she had spoken to leaders at Spelman College and Morehouse College, where she said the the young people were students. She said she'd also spoken to representatives for the students but hadn't yet spoken directly to them. Shields offered an apology and said she knows the officers' behavior was unacceptable and caused further fear. 'Sometimes the best thing, the only thing you can do as a police chief is come in and clean up the mess that's before you,' Shields said. 'When wrong is wrong, we have to, as law enforcement, start dealing with it in the same manner that we would deal with it with non-law enforcement,"" Shields said. ""For some reason, we've fallen into a gray area where there's a separate set of rules for law enforcement, and if we want to get out of this space that we're in now we have to change how we manage internally.' Shields said she experienced a broad range of emotions as just a few hours before she saw the video, another of her officers was seriously injured. A preliminary investigation indicates the officer was in an intersection on foot to block traffic from passing into an area where there were protesters when a person on an ATV approached at a high rate of speed and hit him. Officer Maximilian Brewer suffered significant injuries to his legs and remained in the intensive care unit Sunday evening, Shields said, adding that she hopes he'll be able to walk again. The ATV rider was taken into custody at the scene and to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police on Sunday night identified the driver of the ATV as 42-year-old Avery Goggans. He has been charged with DUI, serious injury by vehicle, reckless driving, possession of marijuana and several other traffic charges, police Sgt. John Chafee said in an email. Bottoms imposed a 9 p.m. curfew for Saturday and Sunday. Gov. Brian Kemp authorized up to 3,000 National Guard troops to be deployed in cities across the state to respond if needed to protests over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in coastal Georgia. Atlanta police said Sunday they had arrested more than 150 people as protesters threw rocks at officers and broke windows in the downtown area. The curfew was initially imposed after demonstrations Friday night turned violent with people setting fires and smashing windows at businesses and restaurants.",0.0

(WAVY) — Residents around the country are out in the streets to protest the death of George Floyd and the Hampton Road community is among them. Floyd was seen last week on video being pinned down by three Minneapolis officers while in police custody. One officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on Floyd’s neck as he continuously yelled in distress. Following nationwide outrage, Chauvin was fired and has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. In Norfolk Sunday, hundreds of demonstrators gathered at Martin Luther King J.

It has since reopened. The group Black Lives Matter 757 moved to the Virginia Beach Oceanfront to protest Sunday night. A growing crowd blocked parts of Atlantic Avenue in the resort city. On Friday, hundreds of people descended on Downtown Norfolk and Fort Monroe in Hampton Black Lives Matter 757 organized two gatherings in Hampton Roads Friday called “blackout757.” Both began at 7:57 p.m. One was at Fort Monroe in Hampton near the pavilion, and another was in Martin Luther King Jr. Monument Park and the surrounding area in Norfolk. The demonstration began at approximately 7:57 p.m. and the crowd moved on foot along the seawall at Fort Monroe to the gazebo. Police say the crowd eventually dispersed from the interstate but reconvened in the area of Peninsula Town Center. After marching through the streets of the Peninsula Town Center, the group made its way onto Cunningham Drive, and eventually onto W. Mercury Boulevard near the Interstate 64 interchange around 9 p.m. Their signs read “Black Lives Matter” and “No justice, no peace, no police brutality.” A livestream on the Black Lives Matter 757 Facebook page showed protesters walking eastbound near the HRBT down the entrance ramp off Mallory Street. Before the protest, Hampton Police say they reached out to the organizers prior to the event to make sure the planned demonstrations would be safe and peaceful. According to reports, the crowd split into two groups. One group comprised of Black Lives Matter 757 coordinators made its way back to the Peninsula Town Center and dispersed peacefully. The second group remained in the area of W. Mercury Boulevard. That crowd confronted officers in the Lidl parking lot who went to that area for security, and the police say demonstrators physically blocked traffic in both directions on W. Mercury Boulevard. HAPPENING NOW: @HamptonVAPolice and Virginia State Police are at Peninsula Town Center where Black Lives Matter 757 protestors are gathering.

Four individuals, including two adults and two juveniles, were arrested for charges including assault on law enforcement and disorderly conduct. The situation was resolved just before 2:30 a.m. Hampton Police say that although they support the demonstrators’ right to peacefully protest, demonstrations that insight violence and mayhem “cannot and will not be tolerated.” Saturday evening just after 9 p.m., protesters went through the westbound side of the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth blocking traffic. The eastbound lane was already scheduled to be closed. Demonstrators started their march at 2 p.m. after a speech in front of the Norfolk Police Operations Center. Norfolk Police Chief Larry D. Boone joined the protesters and marched on the streets of Norfolk. Portsmouth Police followed the protesters who eventually made their way back to I.C. Norcom High School, where the protest began. Later in the evening, it was found that the Confederate Monument was vandalized. Latest posts",0.0

Protests were held in U.S. cities over the death of Floyd, a black man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) LOS ANGELES – Armed National Guard soldiers lined the steps of Los Angeles City Hall and cities across California declared curfews Sunday to head off more violence after unruly demonstrators at earlier protests burned police cars, broke into stores and skirmished with officers. In more than 20 cities, thieves smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry — boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes and cellphones and TVs. Nearly 400 people were arrested in Los Angeles from unrest Saturday as protests have become increasingly violent over several nights because of outrage over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, Police Chief Michel Moore said. Moore said he hoped the National Guard and additional officers deployed would help. But before the sun set, there was brazen theft in Santa Monica and Long Beach even while nearby protests were mostly peaceful. Violence statewide include an arm wound suffered by a gunshot victim in Walnut Creek. In Sacramento, where no curfew was imposed, nightfall brought more violence and destruction at businesses in the city’s midtown area and near the Capitol after a largely peaceful daytime protest. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at those who ignored orders to leave. Across the state, devastated shop owners cleaned up. In Emeryville, across the bay from San Francisco, where thieves stormed malls late Saturday, Keyla Calderon swept up glass outside the medical scrubs shop Uniform Advantage. Calderon's store had just reopened after being shuttered for six weeks under California’s orders to stem spread of the coronavirus. She said she had just returned home Saturday when she learned the burglar alarm was triggered. She turned on the news to see scenes of people breaking into her shop and others. “To hear the alarm ring and see people destroy the store before my eyes, it was heartbreaking,” Calderon said. ""We’re all working hard to feed our family. We have nothing to do with these injustices, yet we’re paying the consequences.” Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed 1,000 members of the Guard to assist the 20,000 officers of the Los Angeles police and sheriff’s departments, Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The San Francisco police chief said about 200 outside officers were en route. Humvees lined up outside Los Angeles City Hall, and troops stood behind police on the steps of the building as protesters gathered despite a curfew. Unrest in Santa Monica happened not far from a peaceful demonstration near the city’s famous pier as looters targeted shops near the popular Third Street Promenade. They broke into a Gap store and a Vans sneaker store, walking out with boxes with no police in sight. A woman holding a sign saying “End All Violence” tried to block a man with a hammer from smashing the door of an REI store. The man yanked her from the door. She returned to the doorway and another protester joined her and the vandals eventually moved on. But others later made off with merchandise. As protesters gathered in Long Beach, thieves swarmed nearby stores at The Pike Outlets. A Forever 21 store was a favored target, and a steady stream emerged carrying armloads of clothing. Some stopped to change into stolen items. A bizarre scene unfolded about a half-mile away when people stealing from a clothing store became trapped inside as police gathered outside the mostly boarded-up store front. A woman screamed inside and then a man kicked his way out a window above the plywood and dropped to the sidewalk. He was followed by more than a half-dozen others, with one man throwing out an armload of clothes and then gathering them up and running off as police nearby didn’t attempt to make arrests. About 1,000 people marched through the streets of San Francisco, carrying signs and chanting “George Floyd,” “Black Lives Matter.” “We’re here because George Floyd was murdered in cold blood,"" Aliasiah Allah said. In San Diego, a protest took an ominous turn after several hours when police said they fired tear gas to disperse a crowd pelting them with rocks and bottles. In Los Angeles, damage from Saturday's violence included windows shattered at nearly every shop along a stretch of trendy Melrose Avenue. Alan Kokozian looked up through a hole in the roof of Tony K's Shoe Store, where fire had burned and most of his inventory was stolen or damaged. He had pleaded for people to spare his establishment and was struck in the head with a bottle. “This was not a political protest,” Kokozian said. Officials acknowledged the anger of protesters over the death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee to Floyd’s neck, and affirmed their right to demonstrate. But they condemned the wave of crime by a small number that had overshadowed the protest message. “It breaks my heart, too, to think about the Angelenos protesting in peace and fighting for justice how this violence and looting clouds that picture,"" Garcetti said. Yet it was hard to ignore images of police cars engulfed in flames in Los Angeles, people running out the broken door of an Alexander McQueen luxury clothing store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills or demonstrators tossing fireworks at officers in Santa Ana. There was also video of officers in skirmish lines in LA, some swinging clubs at protesters, others firing projectiles at people with their hands up and crowds running from a cloud of tear gas in Beverly Hills. Garcetti praised the 99.99% of officers he said had shown restraint. Moore, who was on the front lines Saturday, said officers had acted appropriately, though he acknowledged some “individual failures.” Five LAPD officers were injured in the clashes and two hospitalized, including one who required surgery after his skull was fractured by a brick, Moore said. San Francisco’s popular Union Square saw people stealing leather bags from the Coach store and shoes from the Salvatore Ferragamo location, The Mercury News reported. Streets were littered with bras from Victoria’s Secret and cushioned jewelry boxes from Swarovski. Mayor London Breed said the city's 8 p.m. curfew would be extended indefinitely. Breed expressed sadness about the destruction and said she was not going to tolerate the violence. “I was extremely upset because unfortunately with some of the vandals, they thought this was a game, they thought this was funny,"" Breed said. Protests also roiled the east San Diego suburb of La Mesa, where two adjacent banks burned to the ground. “I think people are hurting and they’re angry and they’re trying to be heard because there’s no other way to get anyone’s attention,” Ally Kaiahua said of the property damage in La Mesa. ___ Nguyen reported from Emeryville.

(AP Photo/John Locher) LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — For a second day in a row, Las Vegas protests over the death of George Floyd turned violent as police arrested over 100 people and deployed tear gas into crowds of protesters in downtown Las Vegas Saturday night. According to Metro Police, 11 officers were injured in Saturday’s violent protest. Injuries range from cuts to broken bones, but no officers were hospitalized. These arrests and injuries come after Friday’s demonstration where 80 people were arrested and 12 police officers were injured during protests on the Las Vegas Strip. READ: Las Vegas protest turns violent, leads to 80 arrests and 12 injured officers Before the protests began Saturday, community and faith leaders urged protesters to remain calm and under control while freely exercising their First Amendment rights. For a few hours, protest remained peaceful, but then crowds grew to about 1,500-2,000 people, Metro Police estimate. The demonstration devolved into protesters vandalizing cars, breaking store windows and looting an EZ Pawn shop on Las Vegas Boulevard. Police say one protesters hurled a cinder block at one officer and injured him. Other officers, police say, were pelted with rocks. About 300 Metro officers were deployed to areas throughout downtown. Protests first began at the Container Park on Fremont and 7 Streets, and stretched through the downtown area from the Clark County Detention Center to the Federal Courthouse. When officers ordered the crowd to disperse, protesters “defied lawful orders,” according to LVMPD. After officers issued several warnings to protesters, police then deployed canisters of tear gas around midnight. Some protesters, Metro says, then went on to tag buildings and destroy surrounding property. One patrol car was burned and two others were damaged. City and county buildings were also targeted. Authorities are still working to assess the damage. Latest Stories Get breaking news, weather, and sports delivered to your smartphone with the WFXR News app available on Apple and Android.",0.0

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — What began as a peaceful march for justice following the death of George Floyd began to spiral out of control Sunday night. Black Lives Matter 757 organized the ""#BlackOut757"" rally at the Oceanfront as the protesters stood ""in solidarity with the rest of the nation in unrest, demanding justice for George Floyd."" The event began peacefully while Virginia Beach police stood by as crowds of protesters walked along a long stretch of Atlantic Avenue. Officers said a small number of marchers started engaging in criminal activity. Some of that included smashing the windows of some businesses. Tension grew, and shortly after 10:30 p.m. the police department declared the gathering an ""unlawful assembly."" They asked people to leave. Most protesters did, but officers began using tear gas on smaller groups that remained in an attempt to get them to disperse. A 13News Now crew was at the scene and witnessed the damage left overnight on Atlantic Avenue. Trash, bricks and damaged property filled Atlantic Avenue. In the heat of the protest, boxes were set on fire and smoke and tear gas filled the air. People were handing each other milk to pour on their faces to alleviate the burning. Witnesses claimed to have heard gunshots fired too. Dough Boys restaurant owners didn’t view what happened as a peaceful protest. Especially when they barely opened. “We’re already behind. Do this to people who are working hard and struggling already is just so wrong. It’s just so wrong,” said Dough Boys owner George Kotarides. Police restricted access to vehicles and pedestrians, and they asked that residents and visitors avoid the area. At one point in the night, a red pickup truck appeared to intentionally speed up while demonstrators were walking in the street. At 2 a.m., the Virginia Beach Police Department said there were no other ""acts of disturbance"" at the Oceanfront. A heavy police presence would remain, and officers, once again, asked people who live in the city and visitors to avoid the area. Posted by Angelo Vargas 13News Now on Sunday, May 31, 2020 In addition to calling to calling for justice after the death of George Floyd, event organizers said they had wanted to protest harassment by Virginia Beach police, as well as the city's history of not allowing minorities to own and run businesses ""on our state's vacation hot spot."" Virginia Beach recently conducted a racial disparity study, after a report found less than 19 percent of city contracts were awarded to women and minority-owned businesses between 2012 and 2017.

Joe Biden quietly visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. That low-key, high-touch approach may be a sign of how the presumptive Democratic nominee presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by the much louder, more persistent voice of Trump. On one of the most profound weekends the nation has seen, with violence in dozens of cities, Biden was out of wide public view. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.” Reassurance requires presence, though, and that has been a hurdle for the former vice president, driven inside by the coronavirus pandemic, still working to adapt to the power of social media as a substitute and without the natural platform of a public office. There are some signs that Biden is looking to take on a more active role. On Sunday, his campaign released a photo of him visiting the site of protests in Wilmington. Biden, wearing a mask to protect from COVID-19, knelt down to talk to a man and a young child. “The only way to bear this pain is to turn all that anguish to purpose,” Biden wrote in a message attached to the photo. “And as President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen.” On Monday, Biden plans to venture out again to meet with community leaders in Wilmington. Demings said she has also offered to have discussions with the Biden campaign on criminal justice reforms. She's pushed for a major Justice Department review of law enforcement agencies throughout the country, and said she saw a role for the federal government in implementing standard policies that govern hiring, training, retention and pay and benefits for law enforcement officers. “What I have done is offer my service to the campaign and, and anyone else, to look at what we can do working together moving forward. And so we’ll see. We have a lot of work to do,” she said. “We’re going to discuss ideas and make recommendations.” Biden released a criminal justice reform plan last July, but has not issued an updated or more specific proposal since then. In early May, he released his “Plan for Black America,” an economic- and education-focused agenda that included marijuana decriminalization. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He's called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. Democrats believe the former vice president draws a contrast with Trump in such moments that works in his favor. They note that while Biden didn't appear on television all weekend, he spoke about Floyd's death before Trump addressed it and has shown compassion for the protesters. Trump has alternated between expressing alarm over Floyd's death and sympathy for his family and issuing tweets antagonizing protesters and disparaging his political enemies. And in an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. And some Democrats who have criticized Biden in the past for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. “I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”",0.0

Following nationwide outrage, Chauvin was fired and has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. In Norfolk Sunday, hundreds of demonstrators gathered at Martin Luther King J.

It has since reopened. The group Black Lives Matter 757 moved to the Virginia Beach Oceanfront to protest Sunday night. A growing crowd blocked parts of Atlantic Avenue in the resort city. On Friday, hundreds of people descended on Downtown Norfolk and Fort Monroe in Hampton Black Lives Matter 757 organized two gatherings in Hampton Roads Friday called “blackout757.” Both began at 7:57 p.m. One was at Fort Monroe in Hampton near the pavilion, and another was in Martin Luther King Jr. Monument Park and the surrounding area in Norfolk. The demonstration began at approximately 7:57 p.m. and the crowd moved on foot along the seawall at Fort Monroe to the gazebo. Police say the crowd eventually dispersed from the interstate but reconvened in the area of Peninsula Town Center. After marching through the streets of the Peninsula Town Center, the group made its way onto Cunningham Drive, and eventually onto W. Mercury Boulevard near the Interstate 64 interchange around 9 p.m. Their signs read “Black Lives Matter” and “No justice, no peace, no police brutality.” A livestream on the Black Lives Matter 757 Facebook page showed protesters walking eastbound near the HRBT down the entrance ramp off Mallory Street. Before the protest, Hampton Police say they reached out to the organizers prior to the event to make sure the planned demonstrations would be safe and peaceful. According to reports, the crowd split into two groups. One group comprised of Black Lives Matter 757 coordinators made its way back to the Peninsula Town Center and dispersed peacefully. The second group remained in the area of W. Mercury Boulevard. That crowd confronted officers in the Lidl parking lot who went to that area for security, and the police say demonstrators physically blocked traffic in both directions on W. Mercury Boulevard.

Four individuals, including two adults and two juveniles, were arrested for charges including assault on law enforcement and disorderly conduct. The situation was resolved just before 2:30 a.m. Hampton Police say that although they support the demonstrators’ right to peacefully protest, demonstrations that insight violence and mayhem “cannot and will not be tolerated.” Saturday evening just after 9 p.m., protesters went through the westbound side of the Downtown Tunnel in Portsmouth blocking traffic. The eastbound lane was already scheduled to be closed. Demonstrators started their march at 2 p.m. after a speech in front of the Norfolk Police Operations Center. Norfolk Police Chief Larry D. Boone joined the protesters and marched on the streets of Norfolk. Portsmouth Police followed the protesters who eventually made their way back to I.C. Norcom High School, where the protest began. Later in the evening, it was found that the Confederate Monument was vandalized. Latest posts",0.0

Biden’s full statement is below: “These last few days have laid bare that we are a nation furious at injustice. Every person of conscience can understand the rawness of the trauma people of color experience in this country, from the daily indignities to the extreme violence, like the horrific killing of George Floyd. Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not. The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest. It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance. I know that there are people all across this country who are suffering tonight. Suffering the loss of a loved one to intolerable circumstances, like the Floyd family, or to the virus that is still gripping our nation. Suffering economic hardships, whether due to COVID-19 or entrenched inequalities in our system. And I know that a grief that dark and deep may at times feel too heavy to bear. I know. And I also know that the only way to bear it is to turn all that anguish to purpose. So tonight, I ask all of America to join me — not in denying our pain or covering it over — but using it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy. We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us. As President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen. I will keep the commitment I made to George’s brother, Philonise, that George will not just be a hashtag. We must and will get to a place where everyone, regardless of race, believes that “to protect and serve” means to protect and serve them. Only by standing together will we rise stronger than before. More equal, more just, more hopeful — and that much closer to our more perfect union. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. Democratic Party presidential candidate Joe Biden",0.0

Joe Biden quietly visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. That low-key, high-touch approach may be a sign of how the presumptive Democratic nominee presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by the much louder, more persistent voice of Trump. On one of the most profound weekends the nation has seen, with violence in dozens of cities, Biden was out of wide public view. 'He's not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,' said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. 'America just needs to be reassured that there's someone who's understanding, someone who's willing to say, 'Yes, we do have some issues,' and someone who's willing to address it.'

Demings said she has also offered to have discussions with the Biden campaign on criminal justice reforms. She's pushed for a major Justice Department review of law enforcement agencies throughout the country, and said she saw a role for the federal government in implementing standard policies that govern hiring, training, retention and pay and benefits for law enforcement officers. 'What I have done is offer my service to the campaign and, and anyone else, to look at what we can do working together moving forward. And so we'll see. We have a lot of work to do,' she said.

City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for 'overwhelming force' against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. 'Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,' said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. 'Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.' Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. 'They keep killing our people,' said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. 'I'm so sick and tired of it.' But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it 'really shocking to watch.' In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. 'We're not done,' said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at 'far left extremist' groups.

1621896091,2020-05-31 23:43:03,Roanoke Mayor and Police Chief speak on Saturday’s Black Lives Matter protest,https://www.wfxrtv.com/news/local-news/roanoke-mayor-and-police-chief-speak-on-saturdays-black-lives-matter-protest/,en,False,,576666,virginiafirst.com,http://virginiafirst.com/,"ROANOKE, Va. (WFXR) — Roanoke City leaders want residents to know that they are not against protesting. “I really feel the pain, and that’s why we support everyone’s right to peacefully assemble,” said Mayor Sherman Lea, recalling what it was like to grow up as a teenager during the Civil Rights Movement. However, the constitutional right to assemble can be taken away if the protest is no longer peaceful. According to Roanoke Police Chief Sam Roman, several in Saturday’s Black Lives Matter protest pushed the boundaries. “Once actions escalate beyond what is peaceful, you know, we have an obligation… because generally those actions are just made by a few, and we have the obligation to make sure that the entire environment is safe. So we would have to declare that as an illegal assembly and then take the appropriate action,” Roman said. “…and they cause concern for safety, not only the officers but also of the crowd that was there,” Lea added. Law enforcement arrested seven people, in total. They are: Tyreek Burrows – 28 of Roanoke — charged with unlawful gathering and possession of a concealed firearm Devon Johnson – 27 of Roanoke – charged with unlawful assembly Khairajhn Sims – 25 of Roanoke – charged with unlawful assembly Trevor MacDermott – 26 of Roanoke – charged with unlawful assembly Annabelle Layman – 25 of Blacksburg – charged with unlawful assembly Tre’vaughn Wilson – 27 of Roanoke – charged with simple assault (this relates to an incident that happened before police arrived at the Walmart) Cadie Baglin – 20 of Troutville – charged with unlawful assembly Law enforcement was equipped with rubber bullets and tear gas but only used pepper spray as a method of crowd control. For future protests, both Lea and Roman hope there won’t be a need for any use of force, but they will do so if peace becomes unlikely. “Our message is that we definitely want to advocate for peaceful protest,” Roman said. “We do not condone vandalism or violence of any kind like we saw last night,” Lea said. At the news conference on Sunday, May 31, Roanoke City Manager Bob Cowell made the announcement that the city had been placed under a local state of emergency, which would give Cowell the authority to place the city under a mandatory curfew. At this time, no curfew has been established. Latest Stories Get breaking news, weather, and sports delivered to your smartphone with the WFXR News app available on Apple and Android.",0.0

The declaration comes after incidents of protests and unrest over the last several days. The declaration specifically cites incidents happening in the City of Richmond, Prince William County and Roanoke. The incident specifically notes that two buildings were burned in Richmond during the unrest. ""Action is necessary to preserve life and property and to alleviate the conditions caused by this situation,"" the order reads. Incidents of protests and civil unrest have occurred across the country in recent days, largely in response to the police killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The declaration allocates $350,000 for state and local governments and state response and recovery operations authorized and coordinated through the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. It also activates the Virginia National Guard to State Active Duty.

The turbulence sparked by the death of George Floyd — a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes — shook not only the streets of New York and Los Angeles, but dozens of smaller communities such as Fargo, North Dakota, and Lincoln, Nebraska. The damage extended even to buildings near the White House. ""They keep killing our people,"" said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston on Sunday. ""I'm so sick and tired of it."" Peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people on Saturday gave way, in some places, to violence, with police vehicles torched, stores emptied and objects hurled at officers. The police response varied from restrained to aggressive, with officers at times firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Police and peaceful protesters alike pleaded for a stop to violence, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. ""It only hurts the cause,"" said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed the heart of the city. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. ""Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,"" said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. ""Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning."" The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Minneapolis, police, state troopers and National Guard members showed new force Saturday in breaking up demonstrations after three days of police largely avoiding engaging protesters. Dozens of protests were underway or expected Sunday, from Miami to Kansas City to San Francisco. They went forth largely without incident, but sparks of crime continued. In Philadelphia, people robbed stores in broad daylight, and at least one more police vehicle was set ablaze. Streets leading downtown were closed. Chicago likewise restricted downtown access and called in the National Guard. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a ""sacred space."" The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. Among those descending on Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. ""I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,"" he said. County Commissioner Angela Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who held his knee on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. ""We'll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,"" Conley said. In tweets Sunday, President Donald Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at ""far left extremist"" groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. Few parts of America were untouched. Protesters set fires inside Reno's city hall, and police launched tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. By Sunday, the fury had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London's Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In New York, a video Saturday showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. ""The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. Buildings around the U.S. were defaced with spray-painted messages, from the facade of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd's gasped last words — ""I can't breathe"" — were repeated, alongside anti-police messages. Crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. Some leaders prepared to put more soldiers in the streets. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to Athens, Savannah and any other cities where more demonstrations were planned. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses have yet to approach the staggering totals LA saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.",0.0

City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry "" boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for 'overwhelming force' against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. 'Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,' said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. 'Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.' Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. 'They keep killing our people,' said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. 'I'm so sick and tired of it.' But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it 'really shocking to watch.' In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. 'We're not done,' said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress.

'After consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,' said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency. The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general's offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. 'Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,' the memo said. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. "" Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon's largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland. For much of the afternoon and evening protesters were largely peaceful, but there were reports of increased violence directed at police into the night. ___ SEOUL, South Korea "" North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported the demonstrations across the United States in reaction to the death of George Floyd, saying protesters 'harshly condemned' a white police officer's 'lawless and brutal murder' of a black citizen. The article, published with photos, said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting 'No justice, no peace.' It also said there were demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis and that the protests were expected to grow further. ___ Several thousand people marched Monday in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, to protest George Floyd's death and show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters marched from Aotea Square to the U.S. consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans such as 'I can't breathe' and 'The Real Virus is Racism.' Hundreds more joined protests and vigils elsewhere in the country, on a day that was a public holiday. The protests were peaceful. Protesters said they were also standing up against police violence and racism in New Zealand. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" More than 15 people were arrested during protests in Charlotte on Sunday night, the city's police department said. Police said four demonstrators were arrested for assaulting officers, including one for hitting an officer with a rock. Three others were arrested on illegal weapon charges, police said. ___ KANSAS CITY, Missouri "" Shortly after local officials praised what had been a peaceful protest in Kansas City, Missouri, police fired tear gas into the crowd after some demonstrators began lobbing water bottles, law enforcement officials said. A large crowd had gathered at County Club plaza and police had allowed it to slowly dissipate after the city's 8 p.m. curfew took effect. But police used stronger tactics against the smaller crowd that remained when rocks and water bottles started flying and two television station news vehicles were smashed and set on fire. Police declared the scene an 'unlawful assembly' and said the area was clear of activity by midnight. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. "" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee late Sunday ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and stealing in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 for Bellevue. On Saturday night people smashed downtown Seattle store fronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. On Sunday there were break-ins and thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee's activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. 'We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,' Inslee said in a statement. 'But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Break-ins and stealing were rampant in downtown Washington and elsewhere in the city as protests over George Floyd's death turned violent for a third straight night. Protesters broke into a branch of Capital Bank, and empty jewelry boxes could be seen scattered on the sidewalk outside a Mervis Diamonds store. After protesters broke into a La Colombe coffee shop, someone in the crowd yelled, 'What are you looting a coffee shop for? You're messing up the whole message."" ___ NEW YORK "" The mayor of New York City's own daughter is one of the nearly 790 people who have been arrested in the city since protests over the death of George Floyd began last week. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter tells The Associated Press that 25-year-old Chiara de Blasio was arrested Saturday night. An arrest report obtained by The New York Post says she refused to leave a Manhattan street ordered cleared by officers because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn't mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. City Hall spokespeople didn't have an immediate comment. "" By Michael R. Sisak ___ AUSTIN, Texas "" Police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Live television cameras on Spectrum News showed officers firing several shots into the crowd and several people on the ground. Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police. The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35. Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn't have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred. Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence. ___ DENVER "" Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of 'Don't shoot' alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before. Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters 'reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.' ___ PHOENIX "" Protests held Sunday night in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports. An hour before a curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, The Arizona Republic reported. 'Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,' Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers' use-of-force cases. ___ WASHINGTON "" As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were 'intentionally set' around the city. One was at St. John's Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House. The church says every president beginning with James Madison, 'until the present,' has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, 'the church of presidents.' The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website. ___ WASHINGTON "" The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" is being called in to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation's capital, according to two Defense Department officials. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she had requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman "" about 1,200 soldiers "" to report. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The D.C. National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. - By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON "" Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, 'Who do you serve? Who do you protect?' Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd's death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" Michael Jordan is 'deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.' With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. 'I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,' the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand's social media accounts and the team's Twitter account. 'I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. 'I don't have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. 'My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.' ___ BOSTON "" A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence 'criminal and cowardly' in a tweet. The nighttime destruction was a stark contrast to the several protests earlier Sunday that featured thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully. ___ ATLANTA "" Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests. An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets. As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. ___ WASHINGTON "" Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunker Friday, as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, some throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades just outside the executive mansion. That's according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and confirmed by another official. The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Friday protests, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. It sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. In the days since, security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police.

(Daily Memphian via AP) As protests grip the nation, officers have doused crowds with pepper spray, struck protesters with batons, steered police cars into throngs, shoved demonstrators and screamed curses. Some police action has been directed against people smashing windows, breaking into stores and burning cars, but many find other instances more difficult to understand — like the elderly man knocked over by police as he walked with a cane on a Salt Lake City sidewalk. The protests began after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Now, some are questioning whether tough police tactics against demonstrators are actually making the violence worse rather than quelling it. While the protests and subsequent police interactions may be shocking to some, many African Americans aren’t surprised because they’ve endured police brutality for decades, said Chris White, director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, “What’s happening, it’s the way American society has always been,” White said. U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, who was hit by pepper spray Saturday as scuffles broke out near the end of a demonstration in Columbus, Ohio, said police escalated matters by using heavy-handed tactics against “passionate” young demonstrators who were mostly orderly. “Too much force is not the answer to this,” said Beatty, who pressed for peaceful tactics on both sides in a video posted on Twitter by Columbus City Council president Shannon Hardin, who also was pepper-sprayed. Both are African American. In Salt Lake City, a police officer shoved and knocked over an older man who was walking with a cane on a sidewalk near a protest. Another officer stepped in within seconds to assist the man, as did the officer who knocked him down. Police Chief Mike Brown issued a video Sunday saying he'd personally apologized to the man. “It was hard for me to watch what happened, and I know it was even harder for him to experience it,” Brown said. In New York, where video showed two police vehicles driving into a crowd, knocking aside demonstrators, Mayor Bill de Blasio decried what he called ""structural racism"" that leads to violence against minorities, but also defended police. “It is inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers,” he said. “That’s wrong on its face and that hasn’t happened in the history of protests in this city.” Two police officers in Atlanta were fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest incident involving two college students Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Sunday that she and the police chief made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage. Footage shown on TV as captured by local reporters shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out and appear to use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. In a message some saw as encouraging police violence, President Donald Trump praised U.S. Secret Service officers guarding the White House amid demonstrations and said any protesters who breached its fence would face “the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.” In a letter titled “Dear America,” civil rights leader Rev. William Barber II, a pastor at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, said protesters have the right to decry “brutal and inhumane” treatment at the hands of police. “What if, instead of a President who tweets ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts,' we had leadership that could unequivocally say, 'When you use police power in the name of the state to murder, lynch, and destroy, you will be prosecuted for your crimes,'"" Barber wrote. Trump wasn't alone in using loaded language. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety sent a tweet Saturday saying it would strengthen its response to “a sophisticated network of urban warfare.” Hours later, video emerged of police shooting paint projectiles at people gathered on the front porch of a home after curfew in Minneapolis. “Light 'em up,” a man is heard saying before the shooting began. No one appeared seriously injured. Activist Meeko Williams organized a peaceful demonstration in Detroit on Friday and later traveled to Minnesota to help support organizers there. Trying to understand what he sees as increasingly aggressive law enforcement tactics, Williams said police shouldn't “antagonize, provoke or instigate” protesters. “I don’t know what’s going to happen over these next few days in this country because they want these killer cops arrested and they’re not going to stop until they are,” Williams said, referring to the lack of charges against the other three officers at the scene when Floyd's neck was pinned under Chauvin's knee. “People are just sick and tired of being in this predicament, where innocent life has been taken at the hands of those who were to protect and serve us. We have not been heard.” Some protesters are increasing efforts to protect themselves. On Sunday, Black Lives Matter organizers in Tampa, Florida, had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics. The group also had medics and enlisted lawyers and those with legal training to watch out for protesters’ rights from the sidelines. In New York, a police labor group, the Detectives' Endowment Association, noted some police there had been attacked and patrol cars set ablaze. “As we do everything to stop NYC from burning, all we hear from elected officials is criticism,"" the group tweeted. “Maybe they should try it on the front lines.” ___ Reeves and Stafford are members of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

Breonna Taylor, a black woman, was fatally shot by police in her home in March. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings) LOUISVILLE, Ky. – It’s the stuff of nightmares: Breonna Taylor and her boyfriend were in bed when a trio of armed men smashed through the front door. Gunfire erupted, killing the 26-year-old black woman. The three men turned out to be plainclothes police detectives, one of whom was wounded in the chaos and violence that March night. Taylor's death led to protests and a review of how Louisville police use ""no knock"" search warrants, which allow officers to enter a home without announcing their presence, often in drug cases to prevent suspects from getting rid of a stash. Taylor's name is one of those being chanted during nationwide protests decrying police killings of black people. The unrest began after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded that he couldn't breathe as a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground with a knee. More than two months after Taylor's death, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced last week that the police department's use of no-knock warrants has been suspended indefinitely. Civil rights advocates are calling for a permanent ban, though Oregon and Florida are the only states that have outlawed such warrants. Fischer changed the policy after an outcry from Taylor's family and they sued the department and the three officers who served the warrant. The new policy requires Louisville's police chief to sign off on all no-knock warrants before they go to a judge. “These changes, and more to come ... should signal that I hear the community and we will continue to make improvements anywhere that we can,” Fischer said. The three narcotics detectives had a no-knock warrant when they busted down the door of Taylor’s apartment after midnight on March 13. They were investigating a drug dealer named Jamarcus Glover, who was arrested elsewhere the same day. Police said Glover was using Taylor’s address to receive packages they believed could be drugs. No drugs were found at her apartment. Tom Wine, the city’s top criminal prosecutor, said he believes police knocked and announced their presence. ""Simply because the police get a no-knock warrant does not mean they can’t knock and announce,” Wine said last week. But the lawsuit filed on behalf of Taylor’s mother says neighbors didn’t hear the plainclothes detectives knock or identify themselves as officers before they crashed into the apartment. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, told investigators that he thought he was being robbed or that it might be an ex-boyfriend of Taylor's trying to get in. Walker told police he heard knocking but didn’t know who it was. He said he and Taylor were moving toward the door when it was knocked down, so he fired a shot that hit an officer. Authorities had charged Walker with attempted murder but dropped the case last week. Wine said he wanted to let state and federal authorities complete their review of the shooting. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky has urged city leaders to ban no-knock warrants, saying they lead to the deaths of innocent people. A 2014 ACLU report on police militarization detailed several botched SWAT team raids as no-knock warrants were served, including one that year in Georgia that ended with a toddler in a medically induced coma. More recently, police in Montgomery County, Maryland, shot and killed 21-year-old Duncan Lemp in his family’s home while serving a no-knock search warrant. An eyewitness said Lemp was asleep in his bedroom when police opened fire from outside his house, according to an attorney for his family. Police said Lemp, who was white, was armed with a rifle and ignored commands. Lemp family attorney Rene Sandler said police began using no-knock warrants decades ago as a tool in the nation’s war on drugs. They have become the “norm” for many kinds of criminal cases, including non-violent offenses, she said. “It’s an abuse of authority across the board,” said Sandler, a former county prosecutor. Law enforcement consultant Melvin Tucker, who's been a police chief in four cities in the U.S. South, said the element of surprise afforded by no-knock warrants isn’t always justified. “If you’re going in on a drug case where the quantity is so small that they could dispose of it by flushing it down the toilet, you probably shouldn’t be there with a search warrant in the first place. It’s not worthwhile,” said Tucker, who has been an expert witness in dozens of court cases. The number of no-knock warrants served during SWAT team deployments has grown from approximately 1,500 annually in the early 1980s to about 45,000 in 2010, according to Eastern Kentucky University professor Peter Kraska, an expert in police militarization. He said police are adept at working around restrictions and tailoring paperwork to suit the standards of judges issuing search warrants. “Banning no-knock warrants, if any jurisdiction can pull that off, is an important step,” Kraska said. “At the end of the day, banning them probably won’t accomplish much in the real world. But getting them off the books on one level is important.” Kentucky has a “stand your ground” law that gives residents the right to use deadly force against an intruder. Those laws generally haven’t protected people who unwittingly shoot at officers entering their homes, but Walker's dropped charges suggests the circumstances of Taylor’s death could be an “ideologically compatible situation for the left and right,” Kraska said. “These different groups that normally would be at odds with one another all agree on the inappropriateness of no-knock warrants,” he added. “There’s been a lot more political agreement that this is problematic.” ___ Kunzelman reported from Silver Spring, Maryland.

The rally was held outside a Target store at 1 o’clock Sunday afternoon to protest the actions of police brutality that took the life of Minneapolis resident George Floyd, 46. Residents gathered to hear speakers implore them to take action on the local level, to press leaders through the ballot to make sure that the events that have happened in Minneapolis and around the country don’t happen in Stafford. “Too many times we will not show up to the voter’s booth, too many times we let all of our decisions be made for us and do not do anything but complain about what we get. We have got to show up and we have to do what we’re supposed to do. Too many people have died for our ability and our right to vote, but we still do not do it. Our participation is horrible at the voting booth, that’s where we need to fight. And if people don’t do the job we elected them to do, then we get them out of there,” said Vernon Green Jr., founder of GCubed, Inc. a North Stafford IT firm, who led the rally. Speakers implored those in attendance to come together regardless of race, skin color, creed, religion, or political association. Among those speakers in attendance were members of the Stafford County Board of Supervisors, including Tom Coen and Crystal Vaunch, and Stafford County Sheriff David Decatur, Stafford County School Superintendent Dr. Scott Kizner, and Stafford Commissioner of the Revenue Scott Mayausky, human rights lawyer and Virginia Senate hopeful Kasim Rashid. “I ran for the school board four years ago because I cared about the students and the children of Stafford County. I have three sons and one daughter and one reason I ran was because I wanted equity and equality for all children. I saw them treated differently from other kids and I decided no more. I needed to run to make a difference, if you don’t like the policies that they’re running, you run and that’s what I did,” stated Garrisonville District School Board Member R. Pamela Yeung, who also spoke at the rally on the importance of participation in local politics to make positive change. “At this place where we are now, a lot of black people, a lot of people of color we’re just tired. We want to be heard and we don’t just want to be listened to. We want to make sure they change and enact legislation with police departments and making sure they’re monitoring their police officers and holding them accountable. I can truly say I know police officers who are great and are doing a great job and that those who are keeping silent within the police forces must be held accountable. Even in the judicial system, we need to make sure the judges are being held accountable as well. At this point, what we’re saying is we want to see change,” stated Virginia Delegate Joshua Cole (D-28, Fredericksburg, Stafford) who was also in attendance at the rally. This rally is the latest in a series of protests in the county in the wake of the death of George Floyd, who was killed on May 25, 2020. A video that has stormed across the internet shows former Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, placing his knee on Floyd’s head, holding him down on the ground during an arrest attempt. The video captured by onlookers captured Floyd saying “I can’t breathe,” and “please don’t kill me” in the final moments of his life. Four officers, including Chauvin, were fired from the Minneapolis police force. Chauvin was arrested on May 29 and has been charged with manslaughter and third-degree murder. The other three officers have not been arrested or charged. An FBI investigation is ongoing. After the rally at Stafford Marketplace broke up, the second group of protesters entered the area and blocked traffic on nearby Garrisonville Road, leading to six arrests.",0.0

I write the state police’s budget. They’re gonna f***ing regret it.’ “Delegate Carter has not only dishonored the memory of George Floyd, he has also cheapened any justice that his killer will face. The law enforcement officers in Manassas had nothing to do with the tragedy in Minnesota, and did not deserve to be screamed at and threatened by an elected official in the Virginia House of Delegates,” read a statement from the RPV. “When an elected official takes that opportunity to berate brave Virginia first responders doing their jobs to protect the innocent from violence, a line must be drawn. Lee Carter must resign today,” read a statement from the RPV. Potomac Local News cannot independently confirm that the person in the video was Delegate Carter, as it came from an anonymous source, but we can confirm that the delegate was present at the protest where the video was taken. Delegate Carter announced on Twitter that he was sprayed with CS gas (mace) on Saturday, May 30, by Virignia State Police at a protest on Sudley Road near Manassas.. Carter also tweeted that police tried to hit him with a flashbang as he walked away from them. “Virginia State Police sprayed CS directly into my left eye after refusing to answer basic questions for 45min…. They tried to flashbang me again while I was walking away. Twice. They missed. I saved the hand thrown container,” tweeted Delegate Carter. When reached for comment Sunday, Carter said he declined to provide comment for this news outlet. The Sudley Road protest, which was held in light of the killing of George Floyd by former Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, began peacefully about 5 p.m. It later escalated as crowds increased significantly and unidentified individuals began throwing objects at drivers, causing officers from the Prince William County, Manassas City, Fairfax County, Virginia State, and Haymarket Police to arrive at the scene and declare an unlawful assembly. “During the protests, multiple businesses along the Sudley Rd corridor sustained damage and two small fires were reported to shrubbery and a trash receptacle. Numerous police vehicles were also reportedly damaged throughout the evening,” stated Johnathan Perok, the Public Information Office Supervisor for the Prince William County Police in a press release. Protestors, of which there were estimated to be 250, were asked to vacate the area by police and ‘given the opportunity to disperse peacefully.’ Many protestors did not follow police orders, and alleged the use of tear gas and rubber bullets against them. The Prince William County Police have confirmed the use of both tactics at an emergency meeting held by the Prince William County Board of Supervisors on May 31. “Since I was in front of the crowd, I inhaled some of it [tear gas] and ended up running because it was too much to handle. I started coughing and I have to rub my eyes as well. Fortunately, I wasn’t hit by a rubber bullet, but it landed near me,” said Emily Jasmine Reyes, a protestor and Stonewall Jackson High School student. The protest resulted in five arrests, including a DUI and ‘other offenses for driving through a police perimeter,” the injury of four Prince William County police officers, one of whom was taken to a local hospital, and the calling of an emergency meeting by the Prince William County Board of Supervisors.",0.0

It was announced that Delegate Cole was ‘attacked with tear gas by the Fredericksburg police while attempting to check on kids tear-gassed by police,’ on his Facebook by his Chief of Staff. “There are young people who are out protesting, and I want to be very clear: they are not rioting, they are not looting.

The Fredericksburg Police did deploy sting ball grenades were used when the crowds became volatile. VSP deployed flashbangs,” said Fredericksburg police spokeswoman Sarah Kirkpatrick. Protestors also alleged the gas was deployed to incite violence. “Tear gas was used around Cowan later in the day. While protesters actively walked away things were still going off. Police are trying to make this protest violent by deploying the tear gas,” said Ally Miller, a King George County resident.

(Doral Chenoweth/The Columbus Dispatch via AP) WASHINGTON – U.S. officials are seeking to determine whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas Sunday, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreaks of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer's knee. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a “very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.” President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials. ___ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey in Minneapolis; Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Md.; Michael R.

1621967277,2020-06-01 01:30:00,Violence Escalates As Protests Over George Floyd Death Continue,https://www.wmra.org/post/violence-escalates-protests-over-george-floyd-death-continue,en,False,,144825,wmra.org,http://wmra.org/,"Updated 2:25 p.m. ET Protesters staged large-scale demonstrations across the country on Sunday, expressing outrage at the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and, more broadly, anger at police brutality. Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Louisville, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds. More than 17,000 National Guard troops have been activated in states across the U.S. due to civil unrest as of Monday, and that number is expected to grow. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody last Monday. Video shows that a Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes shortly before his death. Tensions were already simmering following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was jogging through a Glynn County, Ga., neighborhood when he was shot dead. Three white men were arrested last month after state investigators took over the case from local authorities. Protests also continued for a fourth straight night in Louisville, Ky., as activists called for justice for Taylor. Police shot and killed the 26-year-old black woman in her home. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitrailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown that had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed, northbound on Interstate 35W. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. ""It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn't appear to drive through any barricades,"" the department tweeted. Some protesters jumped on top of the truck, and as it stopped, they dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. ""He was driving a gas tanker,"" said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. ""He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful."" State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so that the protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest had appeared peaceful. Tensions flare in the nation's capital Washington, D.C., authorities imposed a curfew after an evening of escalating demonstrations. Protesters threw bottles at police and set fires to cars and the basement of historic St. John's Church, which has been visited by every president since James Madison. ""Tonight's curfew will begin at 7 p.m. and will run for two days,"" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a late morning news conference on Monday. It's primary day in the nation's capital on Tuesday, and the curfew goes into effect an hour before polls close at 8 p.m., according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections website. The protests on Sunday began with peaceful marchers, along with a police escort, moving their way along a nearly 2-mile stretch from Howard University to Lafayette Square in front of the White House. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd and other African Americans who have died following police violence. ""Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,"" read a sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. ""It's crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,"" she said. ""We are at a point where it's the same story, the same things are happening. I'm tired of this."" But after clashes with law enforcement and the fires erupting, police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Kentucky authorities investigate shooting death in Louisville Kentucky's governor said that one person died early Monday as security forces confronted a crowd in central Louisville. ""While working to disperse a crowd, [Louisville Metro Police Department] and the Kentucky National Guard were fired upon,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. ""LMPD and the Kentucky National Guard returned fire resulting in a death."" He announced that the Kentucky State Police will be investigating the matter. Statement from Governor Andy Beshear: pic.twitter.com/MyHxcE3Ntn — Governor Andy Beshear (@GovAndyBeshear) June 1, 2020 Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted his ""deepest condolences"" for the family of the man, whom he identified as David McAtee. Fischer also called for a Day of Reflection on Monday. He held a late morning virtual gathering on Facebook with faith leaders after another night of demonstrations in the city over the death of Breonna Taylor. On Sunday, law enforcement officers earlier fired tear gas into a crowd assembled in the Jefferson Square area of the city, NPR member station WFPL reported. At a Sunday evening news conference, Fischer again thanked those protesting peacefully but said others were ""hijacking"" their efforts. Tomorrow, Monday, June 1, 2020 I am declaring a Day of Reflection in our city. We will have a virtual gathering at 11:30 a.m. Monday on Facebook with local faith leaders. We’ll be talking about the events of the last few days & acknowledging the pain we’ve all felt. 2/2 — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) June 1, 2020 Atlanta officers terminated for excessive force Two Atlanta police officers have been terminated and three others placed on desk duty after a video of the arrest of two young African Americans leaving the protests Saturday night went viral. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the officers' firing on Sunday, saying the footage ""was disturbing on many levels."" ""We understand our officers are working very long hours, under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that veteran officers Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter were terminated. The footage from Streeter's body camera shows the officers confronting the pair as the two were leaving the downtown protests after the 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. At roughly the 2:30 mark in the video, one of them is seen sitting in the driver's seat of a car, recording officers arresting someone else. An officer opens the car door and asks the driver if he wants to go to jail. Several minutes later, officers approach the car again. One uses a baton to smash the driver's side window. Police then use a stun gun on the driver, who has been identified by local media as Messiah Young. Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that Young suffered an epileptic seizure, according to Spelman College's Student Government Association. The second person, a woman who has since been identified as Taniyah Pilgrim, has been released from custody and charges against her dropped. Footage posted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows the passenger pleading with police to stop as they also use a stun gun against her. ''They haven't heard us"": Protests escalate in Southern California Vandalism and violence broke out after peaceful protests in Santa Monica and other parts of Southern California on Sunday — a sequence of events that has become familiar in many U.S. cities in the past week. The new round of destruction came despite a curfew and the presence of the National Guard. ""We tried kneeling,"" protester Jesus Guzman, 19, told NPR's Doualy Xaykaothao near the Santa Monica Pier. ""We tried putting on those T-shirts that said 'I can't breathe.' We tried those hashtags. We tried doing it all peacefully, but they haven't heard us — they haven't done nothing."" ""The violence, for him, is justified,"" Xaykaothao reported. With store windows smashed, some shop owners in Santa Monica started cleaning up the mess overnight — the latest setback after weeks of forced closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At their hair salon, Martha Padilla-Bruni and her family were sweeping up broken glass under the streetlights. ""I'm in shock. I don't know what's going to happen,"" Padilla-Bruni told NPR's Nathan Rott. Her son, Joe Franco, said he supports the protesters and those who were there earlier in the day. He said he understands that people are in pain. Franco said, ""But I was here across the street, and what I saw, the people that were doing this ... they were not here to protest. They were here to cause trouble."" Reporter in Long Beach, Calif., hit in throat by rubber bullet KPCC/LAist reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez was hit in the throat by a rubber bullet Sunday evening during protests in Long Beach, Calif. He believes the bullet was fired by Long Beach police, who had been firing the projectiles nearby. ""I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat,"" Guzman-Lopez said via Twitter, posting an image of his wound. ""I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street."" I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat.

The reporter said he had just finished interviewing a man who had been kneeling in protest when he himself was hit. ""I talked to him for about a minute, and just as I was finishing talking to him — right after I said, 'Thank you' — I heard a pop and I felt something, you know, the bottom of my throat, and I saw something bounced onto the ground, and then I ran,"" he said. ""As I was running, I did start to feel its sting, and then I put my fingers to my throat and there was blood on my fingers."" A number of journalists have been hit with police projectiles during the protests, including MSNBC's Ali Velshi, who was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet in Minneapolis, and a Louisville TV reporter who was shot with pepper balls.

The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. “Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.” Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.” Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. On Monday evening, Trump declared himself “the president of law and order” from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S. He plans to deliver remarks on the unrest gripping the U.S. on Tuesday in Philadelphia. In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.” Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. “I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.” ___ Jaffe reported from Washington; Peoples reported from Montclair, New Jersey.

1621973677,2020-06-01 02:05:06,Civil unrest could influence Biden's search for running mate,https://www.wsls.com/news/politics/2020/06/01/civil-unrest-could-influence-bidens-search-for-running-mate/,en,False,,90694,wsls.com,http://www.wsls.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON – Joe Biden’s search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd’s death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden’s choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a “transition” candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd’s death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. “The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it’s important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who’s been asked for input by Biden’s team on the selection process. Biden was pressed to pick a black woman on Monday when he visited a black church in Wilmington, Delaware. ""A black female will overwhelm and excite and turn the heads of these young people and everybody out there,” an attendee told Biden, referring to those demonstrating in the streets. Beyond Bottoms, Biden is believed to be considering California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. In an interview Sunday with The Associated Press, Demings didn't answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman. “Well, we’ve never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate,” she said. ""But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward."" Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. Demings, a former Orlando police chief, defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring “you’re either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution.” ""The community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,” she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. “Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,” he said. “I’ve got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn’t want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same.” Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota’s largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd’s murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. “This is very tough timing for her,” said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she’s not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Biden’s search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. “It’s important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don’t mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,” said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair. __ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

A protester runs past burning cars and buildings on Chicago Avenue, Saturday, May 30, 2020, in St. Paul, Minn. Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. “Before our operation kicked off last night, a very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers was executed,” Walz said. “That’s not somebody sitting in their basement. That’s pretty sophisticated.” Walz did not offer details. President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to hundreds of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “I think mostly they don’t want to hurt these protests. They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. “It’s very scattershot,” she said. “They are all talking about it, but they don’t seem to be able to translate that online fantasizing about what they’d like to do into real-world action, which is good.” Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy. “They had tools to break windows and tools or a strategy to distribute materials, among them,” she said. ""The thing that we're struck by is that it was an organized group that appeared more bent on destruction on then on protest.” ___ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey in Minneapolis; Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Md.; Michael Biesecker in Reston, Va.; David Klepper in Providence, Rhode Island; and James LaPorta in Delray Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.

1621978716,2020-06-01 02:18:15.831904,GRAPHIC: Unrest overshadows peaceful US protests for another night,https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Were-sick-of-it-Anger-over-police-killings-shatters-US-570903111.html,en,True,,80667,whsv.com,http://www.whsv.com/#spider,"Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets across America again Sunday, with peaceful demonstrations against police killings of black people overshadowed by unrest that ravaged cities from Philadelphia to Los Angeles and flared near the White House. Police move towards a protester after curfew Saturday, May 30, 2020, in Minneapolis. Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (Source: AP Photo/John Minchillo) City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry — boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for ""overwhelming force"" against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. ""Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,"" said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. ""Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning."" Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. ""They keep killing our people,"" said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. ""I'm so sick and tired of it."" But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it ""really shocking to watch."" In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. ""We're not done,"" said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests."" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at ""far left extremist"" groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a ""sacred space."" Among in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. ""I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,"" he said. ___ Morrison and Sullivan reported from Minneapolis.

'After consultation with the California Highway Patrol and Office of Emergency Services, the decision was made this evening to advise all state departments with offices in downtown city areas to close tomorrow, and to notify staff of the decision,' said Amy Palmer, a spokeswoman for the state Government Operations Agency. The directive was sent Sunday evening and it was left up to officials at individual agencies to determine which buildings should be closed. A state Department of Justice memo sent to employees said the attorney general's offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego would be closed, though employees who can work from home should do so. 'Staff assigned to these offices should not report to work for any reason. Staff who are able to telework should continue to do so despite the office closures,' the memo said. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. "" Police in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd downtown late Sunday night after authorities said projectiles were thrown at officers. Earlier, police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse, and authorities on loudspeakers declared the gathering a civil disturbance. Thousands of people marched throughout Oregon's largest city on Sunday, the third day of George Floyd protests in Portland. For much of the afternoon and evening protesters were largely peaceful, but there were reports of increased violence directed at police into the night. ___ SEOUL, South Korea "" North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported the demonstrations across the United States in reaction to the death of George Floyd, saying protesters 'harshly condemned' a white police officer's 'lawless and brutal murder' of a black citizen. The article, published with photos, said hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting 'No justice, no peace.' It also said there were demonstrations in Minneapolis, New York, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis and that the protests were expected to grow further. ___ Several thousand people marched Monday in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, to protest George Floyd's death and show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters marched from Aotea Square to the U.S. consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans such as 'I can't breathe' and 'The Real Virus is Racism.' Hundreds more joined protests and vigils elsewhere in the country, on a day that was a public holiday. The protests were peaceful. Protesters said they were also standing up against police violence and racism in New Zealand. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" More than 15 people were arrested during protests in Charlotte on Sunday night, the city's police department said. Police said four demonstrators were arrested for assaulting officers, including one for hitting an officer with a rock. Three others were arrested on illegal weapon charges, police said. ___ KANSAS CITY, Missouri "" Shortly after local officials praised what had been a peaceful protest in Kansas City, Missouri, police fired tear gas into the crowd after some demonstrators began lobbing water bottles, law enforcement officials said. A large crowd had gathered at County Club plaza and police had allowed it to slowly dissipate after the city's 8 p.m. curfew took effect. But police used stronger tactics against the smaller crowd that remained when rocks and water bottles started flying and two television station news vehicles were smashed and set on fire. Police declared the scene an 'unlawful assembly' and said the area was clear of activity by midnight. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. "" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee late Sunday ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and stealing in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 for Bellevue. On Saturday night people smashed downtown Seattle store fronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. On Sunday there were break-ins and thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee's activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. 'We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,' Inslee said in a statement. 'But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.' ___ WASHINGTON "" Break-ins and stealing were rampant in downtown Washington and elsewhere in the city as protests over George Floyd's death turned violent for a third straight night. Protesters broke into a branch of Capital Bank, and empty jewelry boxes could be seen scattered on the sidewalk outside a Mervis Diamonds store. After protesters broke into a La Colombe coffee shop, someone in the crowd yelled, 'What are you looting a coffee shop for? You're messing up the whole message."" ___ NEW YORK "" The mayor of New York City's own daughter is one of the nearly 790 people who have been arrested in the city since protests over the death of George Floyd began last week. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter tells The Associated Press that 25-year-old Chiara de Blasio was arrested Saturday night. An arrest report obtained by The New York Post says she refused to leave a Manhattan street ordered cleared by officers because people were throwing things. Chiara de Blasio, who is black, was later given a court summons and released. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is white, didn't mention the arrest in his Sunday press briefing. City Hall spokespeople didn't have an immediate comment. "" By Michael R. Sisak ___ AUSTIN, Texas "" Police fired rubber bullets and pepper spray late Sunday night at demonstrators who gathered outside the downtown police station in Austin. Live television cameras on Spectrum News showed officers firing several shots into the crowd and several people on the ground. Some people could be seen throwing water bottles at police. The officers were stationed above the crowd on the steps of the police station and a raised section of Interstate 35. Unlike Dallas, where police made dozens of arrests to enforce a downtown curfew, Austin doesn't have a curfew and demonstrators have been roaming downtown from the police station to the state Capitol several blocks away for nearly 10 hours. The crowd has ebbed and flowed from a few thousand to a few hundred. Demonstrators could not get on the Capitol grounds, which were protected by a large police presence. ___ DENVER "" Police fired tear gas and projectiles at demonstrators defying a Denver curfew Sunday night following a day of peaceful marching and chants of 'Don't shoot' alongside boarded-up businesses that had been vandalized the night before. Dozens of demonstrators, some throwing fireworks, taunted police and pushed dumpsters onto Colfax Avenue, a major artery, in the sporadic confrontations that occurred east of downtown. The demonstration over the death of George Floyd came after turbulent protests that led to the arrest of 83 people Saturday night. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called the behavior of unruly protesters 'reckless, inexcusable and unacceptable.' ___ PHOENIX "" Protests held Sunday night in downtown Phoenix appeared to be peaceful, according to local media reports. An hour before a curfew went into effect, activist Armonee Jackson told protesters in the parking lot of an art gallery downtown that they should avoid any violence, The Arizona Republic reported. 'Listen to me: We are not ending in violence. I refuse to end in violence,' Jackson told the crowd. David Riutta told the newspaper that he came out to protest police brutality and wants to see a panel of civilians investigate officers' use-of-force cases. ___ WASHINGTON "" As demonstrations continued past an 11 p.m. curfew, D.C. police said they were responding to multiple fires that were 'intentionally set' around the city. One was at St. John's Episcopal Church, which is located across Lafayette Park from the White House. The church says every president beginning with James Madison, 'until the present,' has attended a service at the church, giving it the nickname, 'the church of presidents.' The first services at the church were held in 1816, according to its website. ___ WASHINGTON "" The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard "" roughly 1,700 soldiers "" is being called in to help with the response to protests outside the White House and elsewhere in the nation's capital, according to two Defense Department officials. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she had requested 500 Guardsman to assist local law enforcement. Later on Sunday, as the protests escalated, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the rest of the Guardsman "" about 1,200 soldiers "" to report. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. The D.C. National Guard did not reply to a request from The Associated Press for comment. - By James LaPorta ___ WASHINGTON "" Protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations held in response to the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. An hour before the 11 p.m. curfew, police fired a major barrage of tear gas stun grenades into the crowd of more than 1,000 people, largely clearing Lafayette Park across the street from the White House and scattering protesters into the street. Protesters piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit a raging fire in the middle of H Street. Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames. As the curfew hit, police sealed the perimeter of the park. Shortly beforehand, police pushed a crowd of about 300 demonstrators several blocks with a series of charges with batons and riot shields. Enraged protesters screamed, 'Who do you serve? Who do you protect?' Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters. Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men's Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. ___ At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests across the country since George Floyd's death Monday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from thefts to blocking highways and breaking curfew. The arrest figures as of 11 p.m. EST on Sunday included those from demonstrations in New York and Philadelphia on the East Coast, Chicago and Dallas in the Midwest and Southwest, and Los Angeles on the West Coast as protests take place all over the county. In Dallas, police began sweeping downtown streets with arrests to enforce a curfew that went into effect at 7 p.m. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. "" Michael Jordan is 'deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry.' With protesters taking to the streets across the United States again Sunday, Jordan released a statement on George Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police. 'I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,' the former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand's social media accounts and the team's Twitter account. 'I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough. 'I don't have the answers, but our collective voices show strength and the inability to be divided by others. We must listen to each other, show compassion and empathy and never turn our backs on senseless brutality. We need to continue peaceful expressions against injustice and demand accountability. Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change. Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all. 'My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.' ___ BOSTON "" A Sunday afternoon of mostly peaceful protests in Boston broke at nightfall when demonstrators clashed with officers, throwing rocks, breaking into several stores and lighting a police vehicle on fire. Boston police tweeted that at least 40 people had been arrested as of 3 a.m. Monday. Police said seven police officers had been hospitalized and 21 police cruisers were damaged. A National Guard unit was called in to help quell the unrest. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker called the violence 'criminal and cowardly' in a tweet. The nighttime destruction was a stark contrast to the several protests earlier Sunday that featured thousands of demonstrators marching peacefully. ___ ATLANTA "" Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests. An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets. As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. ___ WASHINGTON "" Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunker Friday, as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, some throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades just outside the executive mansion. That's according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and confirmed by another official. The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds. The Friday protests, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. It sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. In the days since, security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. On Sunday, the Justice Department also deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement national guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. "" By Jonathan Lemire and Zeke Miller",0.0
1622019324,2020-06-01 01:25:19,Civil unrest could influence Biden's search for running mate,https://www.progress-index.com/ZZ/news/20200601/civil-unrest-could-influence-bidens-search-for-running-mate?rssfeed=true,en,True,,147801,progress-index.com,http://progress-index.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Joe Biden's search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd's death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden's choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a 'transition' candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd's death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. 'The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it's important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,' said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who's been asked for input by Biden's team on the selection process. Biden was pressed to pick a black woman on Monday when he visited a black church in Wilmington, Delaware. ""A black female will overwhelm and excite and turn the heads of these young people and everybody out there,' an attendee told Biden, referring to those demonstrating in the streets. Beyond Bottoms, Biden is believed to be considering California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. In an interview Sunday with The Associated Press, Demings didn't answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman. 'Well, we've never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate,' she said. ""But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward."" Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. Demings, a former Orlando police chief, defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring 'you're either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution.' ""The community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,' she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. 'Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,' he said. 'I've got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn't want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same.' Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd's murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. 'This is very tough timing for her,' said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she's not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Biden's search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. 'It's important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don't mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,' said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair. __ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,' Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to 'deal with institutional racism' and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and 'access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. 'I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,' Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. 'I realize we've got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.' Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as 'weak' during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that 'Sleepy Joe Biden's people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.' Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. On Monday evening, Trump declared himself 'the president of law and order' from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S. He plans to deliver remarks on the unrest gripping the U.S. on Tuesday in Philadelphia. In the early moments of Monday's gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. 'The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,' pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. 'I want to make something clear. I don't expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump 'ain't black.' Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. 'To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,' said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. 'I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. 'There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.' ___ Jaffe reported from Washington; Peoples reported from Montclair, New Jersey.

Floyd, who after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. (Dean Purcell/New Zealand Herald via AP BANGKOK – Standing at a lectern with a backdrop map of the world behind him reminiscent of one at the State Department, the spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry made a point Monday to criticize the U.S. in English amid ongoing protests over police killings of black people. “To the American people, the world has ... heard your outcry over this state oppression,"" Abbas Mousavi told reporters in Tehran. So too have Washington's adversaries in Iran and elsewhere. Long the target of American criticism, these nations have used the protests over the killing of George Floyd as an opportunity to hit back at the country held up by U.S. leaders for decades as “the shining city upon a hill.” By putting forth images of the unrest, they portray the U.S. as a hypocritical superpower unable to secure its own people, as well as normalizing the violence and repression they visit on their own citizens. “To be clear, though they are trying to sympathize with protesters in the U.S., their aim is to leverage the internal divisions in America, ... not to advance the debate on this,” said Ariane Tabatabai, a Middle East fellow who studies Iran at the Washington-based German Marshall Fund. “Regime officials particularly like the theme of racial tensions in the U.S. because it allows them to point the finger at Washington, which is often front and center condemning human rights abuses by the regime,” she said. That's particularly valuable to Iran, which has violently put down recent nationwide economic demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access. The Islamic Republic has seen its already-ailing economy crater since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers, cutting off its oil sales. “The American regime is pursuing violence and bullying at home and abroad,” Mousavi said. That criticism has extended to Twitter, which Iranian officials use extensively despite the website being banned since the mass protests and crackdown surrounding its disputed 2009 presidential election. Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose disputed re-election sparked the 2009 unrest, called Floyd's killing “disturbing & upsetting.” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif offered a rewritten statement earlier issued by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, crossing out Iran and replacing it with America. Pompeo responded by tweeting: “You hang homosexuals, stone women and exterminate Jews.” State-controlled media in China saw the protests through the prism of American views on Hong Kong’s anti-government demonstrations, which China has long said the U.S. encouraged. In a commentary, the ruling Communist Party newspaper Global Times said Chinese experts had noted that U.S. politicians might think twice before commenting again on Hong Kong, knowing “their words might backfire.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian offered his own criticism at a Beijing news conference. The protests “once again reflect the racial discrimination in the U.S., the serious problems of police violent enforcement and the urgency of solving these problems,” Zhao said. He added that China hopes the U.S. will “safeguard and guarantee the legal rights of ethnic minorities.” That's as China continues a yearslong, massive crackdown that has locked away more than 1 million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslims. In North Korea, the country's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported about the demonstrations, saying that protesters “harshly condemned” a white policeman’s “lawless and brutal murder” of a black citizen. Three large photos showed protests from recent days from Minneapolis, where Floyd died May 25 after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. The officer was fired and charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. Rodong Sinmun noted hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting, “No justice, no peace.” It did not make any direct comments about Trump, whom North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has met three times in high-profile summits. Russia said the United States had systemic human rights problems, criticism that followed a pattern dating to the Cold War. The 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School by nine African American students supported by bayonet-carrying soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division saw one Soviet newspaper use the headline: ""Troops Advance Against Children!” That information warfare continues today in the cyber-realm, as U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia meddled America's 2016 presidential election. Tabatabai said she and her colleagues had been tracking Chinese, Iranian and Russian social media accounts using the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd. U.S. allies as well have been expressing their own opinions on the unrest. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the arrests and assaults on journalists were “very concerning.” Zimbabwe summoned the U.S. ambassador over U.S. national security adviser Robert O’Brien's allegation this weekend that Harare could be one of several foreign adversaries taking advantage of the demonstrations. Meanwhile, Germany’s center-left Social Democratic Party, which is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition, on Monday described itself as “157 (years old) and Antifa. Naturally.” The tweet appeared to be a response to Trump’s assertion that he would designate Antifa, an umbrella description for the far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events, “a terrorist organization.” Across from the U.S. Embassy in Paris, dozens of people knelt in silent protest, urging the French government to take racism and police violence more seriously. Despite a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people because of the coronavirus, they held signs reading “I Can’t Breathe” in English, or “Racism is suffocating us” and “We are all George Floyd” in French. Thousands of people packed Dam Square in central Amsterdam and spilled into several side streets in an unexpectedly large protest to denounce police brutality in the U.S. and Europe. They chanted “Black lives matter!” raising their fists and holding anti-racism signs. In Perth, Australia, the hundreds of demonstrators who peacefully protested Floyd's death also sought to highlight injustices against indigenous Australians. “I believe it’s important as a young indigenous woman to vocalise that this isn’t just an American issue, this is a black people issue and indigenous people fit into that category,” organizer Tanesha Bennell told Nine Network television. Protesters carried banners with messages including “No Pride in Genocide"" and tears appeared as the names of indigenous people who have died in Australian police custody were read to the crowd. ___ Associated Press writers Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Jill Lawless in London, Farai Mutsaka in Harare, Zimbabwe, and Colleen Berry in Milan contributed. ___ Follow the AP’s latest news about the protests in the U.S. at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

(AP Photo/John Minchillo) The Latest on the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck: ___ ST. LOUIS — Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area. The police department tweeted early Tuesday that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots. The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City. On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64. But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. ___ NEW YORK — New York City imposed a late-night curfew Monday that failed to prevent another night of destruction, including arrests after a break-in at the iconic Macy’s store on 34th Street, following protests over George Floyd’s death. As the 11 p.m. deadline to get off the streets approached, bands of protesters marched peacefully through Manhattan and Brooklyn, but police simultaneously responded to numerous reports of roving groups of people smashing their way into shops and emptying them of merchandise. The doors of Macy’s flagship Manhattan store were breached. Police pulled two handcuffed men out and put them in a van. People rushed into a Nike store and carried out armloads of clothing. Near Rockefeller Center, storefront windows were smashed and multiple people arrested. Bank windows were smashed. Wreckage littered the inside of an AT&T store. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop, but instances of vandalism and smash-and-grab thefts mounted as the night deepened. New York joined other cities around the country in imposing a curfew after days of unrest. It comes on top of months of restrictions on public gatherings already imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Enough mayhem happened before the curfew took effect that Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted that it would move up to 8 p.m. Tuesday. The curfew lifts at 5 a.m. ___ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Workers in Alabama’s largest city began removing a Confederate monument Monday night after demonstrators failed to knock down the obelisk the night before. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin sent workers with heavy equipment to take down the more than 50-foot-tall Confederate monument made of stone. Late on Monday, after a 7 p.m. curfew took effect and streets were mostly clear, crews began their work. Live video showed workers attaching straps to the peak of the obelisk so it could be lifted away with a crane. Within a few hours they had removed the top of the monument. Woodfin said the city would see if the memorial could be given to a museum or another group. Woodfin said the fine the city may face for violating a state law banning the removal of Confederate and other long-standing monuments is more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Attorney General Steve Marshall, in a statement, said the city would face an assessment of $25,000 if it removed the monument, which has been the subject of a court fight between the mostly black city and Republican-controlled state. ___ CICERO, Ill. — Two people have been killed during unrest in the Chicago suburb of Cicero as protests continued over the death of George Floyd, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania says 60 people were arrested in the town of about 84,000 located west of Chicago. Hanania didn’t provide additional information about those killed or the circumstances of their deaths. The Illinois State Police and Cook County Sheriff’s Office were called in to help local police Monday as people broke into a liquor store and other businesses and stole items. ___ BUFFALO, N.Y. — A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a George Floyd demonstration Monday night in Buffalo, injuring at least two. Video from the scene shows the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackle a protester on the street and handcuff him. Officers are seen scattering to avoid the SUV as it drives off on Buffalo’s east side. Apparent gunshots are heard. The officers were taken to Erie County Medical Center. Authorities said they were in stable condition. ___ WASHINGTON — Law enforcement officers used tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters to turn back demonstrators in Washington protesting the death of George Floyd. Protesters remained on the streets well past the 7 p.m. curfew that had been imposed by District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser. They had spent hours marching peacefully around the nation’s capital before they were buzzed by the helicopters, which kicked up debris. A standoff developed within site of the Capitol. Protesters smashed windows at the Teamsters building as they dispersed. ___ LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from Louisville’s downtown Jefferson Square, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. Riot police with batons at the ready stood shoulder to shoulder as they advanced down key streets before breaking up the protest after a brief standoff shortly after 10 p.m. Demonstrators shouted at police as authorities on a microphone ordered the crowd to disperse before loud bursts of tear gas crackled and spread acrid, choking smoke over the area. Protesters began running and military-style vehicles could later be seen occupying the key square fronting a courthouse complex. Some protesters gasped and held wet cloths to their faces as they ran from the wafting gas and advancing police. A helicopter clattered overhead amid the bursts of tear gas fire, and streets appeared to largely empty out. ___ Tiger Woods is speaking out for the first time since George Floyd’s death, saying his heart goes out to Floyd, his family and everyone who is hurting right now. The golfer says he has always had the “utmost respect for our law enforcement,” but Floyd’s death crossed a line. Floyd, a black man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and saying that he couldn’t breathe. His death sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the country, some of which became violent. Referencing the protests in his statement, Woods says, “We can make our points without burning the very neighborhoods we live in.” ___ ATLANTA — Protesters were still in the streets of downtown Atlanta on Monday night as curfew neared, and police officers and the National Guard used tear gas, starting shortly before 9 p.m. Protesters largely dispersed after that, though some remained, and officers were making arrests, apparently for curfew violations. A similar scene played out the night before. ___ LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The fatal shooting of the popular owner of a Louisville barbecue spot has prompted a massive march to the site where the restaurateur was killed early Monday. David McAtee died while police officers and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew amid waves of protests in the Kentucky city. Mayor Greg Fischer revealed earlier Monday that police officers lacked body camera video for the investigation. The large group marched peacefully Monday evening as some honked horns in solidarity and marchers raised clenched fists. Louisville’s police chief was fired by the city’s mayor on Monday after the mayor learned that officers failed to activate body cameras at the chaotic scene were McAttee was shot. ___ NASHVILLE, Tenn. — More than 60 National Guard troops put down their riot shields Monday evening at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol in Nashville to honor George Floyd. Guardsman had initially rushed to grab their shields and form a hard line to block the slowly moving crowd — which was singing and chanting — from advancing up the Capitol steps. As the National Guard began moving, Tennessee State Police grabbed batons and formed a line behind them. However, the crowd remained calm. Democratic lawmakers leaving the Capitol asked to be able to move past the line of guards to join the crowd. As the crowd continued to sing and call for justice for black Americans, slowly the shields began to drop. The state troopers declined to drop their batons but backed farther away from the crowd. Monday’s peaceful vigil was a marked difference from several protests that turned violent in Tennessee over the weekend. ___ At least 5,600 people have been arrested in cities around the country since demonstrations broke out protesting the death of George Floyd, according to a tally compiled by AP journalists from police department press releases, police agency Twitter activity and media reports. The protests began after the May 25 death of Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The arrests come as protests in some cities become more violent and as police and governors are urged by President Donald Trump to take a stronger hand in quelling the demonstrations. In Minneapolis, where Floyd died, some 155 arrests have taken place. Some of the biggest cities in the U.S. have made a significant number of arrests, including nearly 800 in New York City and more than 900 in Los Angeles. ___ WASHINGTON — Protesters took a knee in the middle of a downtown Washington street Monday night, chanting, “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now.” They applauded as they rose to their feet and declared that the streets were theirs. Over the past few nights, demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota had asked black police officers to take a knee to show their support. The march Monday night was peaceful as nightfall approached. There was no apparent effort to get protesters off the streets even though a 7 p.m. curfew had passed. Earlier, law enforcement officers on horseback and foot aggressively pushed the protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House so President Donald Trump could visit a church that was damaged by fire during the protests Sunday night. ___ WASHINGTON — Protesters marched on the National Mall and D.C. streets after being driven from the White House by law enforcement officers on horseback and foot so President Donald Trump could visit St. John’s Church, which was damaged during the demonstrations Sunday night. The demonstrators passed the Lincoln and World War II Memorials and the Washington Monument on the Mall before heading back to the streets near the White House. There was no apparent attempt to disburse the protesters even though a 7 p.m. curfew had passed. At Farragut Square, a few blocks from the White House, there were about two law enforcement officers for every civilian. Multiple helicopters buzzed overhead, a relative rarity in the District of Columbia, which is normally a no-fly zone for helicopters and drones. ___ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Heavy equipment arrived Monday night at the Birmingham park where protesters tried but failed to topple a more than 50-foot-tall Confederate monument made of stone Sunday. It could be the first step toward removing the obelisk. Mayor Randall Woodfin has vowed to remove the monument, which was at the center of a court fight between the city and state over an Alabama law protecting rebel memorials. ___ OLYMPIA, Wash. — Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Monday evening slammed President Donald Trump’s threat to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. In an emailed statement in response to the president’s comments, the Democrat said Trump “has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office.” “He cowers at the feet of authoritarians around the world,” Inslee said. “Now he uses the most supreme power of the presidency in a desperate attempt to hide his timidity and vapidity. I pray no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.” The Seattle area has seen several days of violence, including vandalism in the city’s downtown core. ___ PORTLAND, Ore. — Oregon Gov. Kate Brown says she won’t send National Guard troops to actively help quell violent protests in Portland over the killing of George Floyd because they aren’t needed and that “is exactly what President Trump wants.” At a Monday news conference, Brown said she would send 100 state police from around Oregon to assist the city, and activate 50 Guard troops to work in support and behind the scenes. Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump slammed many governors as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations. Trump spoke to governors via video teleconference. Brown said having National Guard soldiers on the streets was the wrong way to go. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” the Democrat said. “Trump wants governors to deploy the national guard to intimidate the public.” Portland remains under a curfew order that takes effect at 8 p.m. nightly. Police arrested 11 adults during protests Sunday and early Monday morning after authorities said projectiles — including “large, industrial grade mortar-type fireworks” — were thrown at officers. “Having soldiers on the streets of America is exactly what President Trump wants,” Brown said. ___ Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather has offered to pay for George Floyd’s funeral and memorial services, and the family has accepted the offer. Mayweather personally has been in touch with the family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. He will handle costs for the funeral on June 9 in Floyd’s hometown of Houston, as well as other expenses. TMZ originally reported Mayweather’s offer. “He’ll probably get mad at me for saying that, but yes, he is definitely paying for the funeral,” Ellerbe told ESPN.com on Monday. Floyd, a black man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and saying that he couldn’t breathe. His death sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the country, some of which became violent. ___ WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is visiting the 200-year-old church near the White House that was set on fire as demonstrators clashed with police over the weekend. Beginning with James Madison, every person who has held the office of president has attended a service at St. John’s Church. Law enforcement cleared protesters out of the area with tear gas before Trump’s visit. Tear gas canisters could be heard exploding as Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. He then walked over to the church. The protesters appeared to be acting peacefully before they were dispersed by force. Trump is urging the nation’s governors to get tougher with violent protesters and to deploy the National Guard. He said in the Rose Garden that he is an ally of peaceful protesters, but he stressed that “I am your president of law and order.” ___ PHILADELPHIA — Police fired non-lethal bullets and tear gas at hundreds of protesters who spilled onto an interstate highway in the heart of Philadelphia on Monday just before a 6 p.m. curfew took effect. The crowds on Interstate 676 also led to the closure of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, the main link from downtown Philadelphia to New Jersey suburbs across the Delaware River. Some climbed a steep embankment and scaled a fence as police acted. More than two dozen were arrested as a few hundred other protesters moved to block the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, a grand thoroughfare leading from downtown the city’s imposing art museum.",0.0

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON – Wielding extraordinary federal authority, President Donald Trump threatened the nation’s governors on Monday that he would deploy the military to states if they did not stamp out violent protests over police brutality that have roiled the nation over the past week. His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump’s bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John’s Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" “It’s all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. “Shameful.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd’s brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Some health experts have warned that a resurgence in cases could take place if Americans don't adhere to strict social distancing, or take other precautions like wear masks. The White House has also said that cases could go down in the warmer summer months. Does that happen? And if so, do Americans get too comfortable and lapse into a false sense of security — only to see a spike in the fall? None of it's clear, but the U.S. is heading into a period of pandemic experimentation with no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus as yet. 3. Could Steve King lose? Steny Hoyer faces challenge: It's hard to believe, but there are elections on Tuesday. Two of the marquee races deal with well-known — and very different — political figures. Controversial Rep. Steve King, with a history of making racist remarks, is in a fight for his political life with state Sen. Randy Feenstra in Iowa's Republican primary. Conservative groups have lined up against King, but he can't be counted out. This district has a long history of voting for him, despite his pariah status within the party. In Maryland, Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, is facing a primary challenge from the left in 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes, inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's unlikely win in New York over Joe Crowley, a former congressional Democratic leader. Iowa, Maryland and several other states, plus Washington, D.C., hold primaries Tuesday. 4. Biden to get closer to officially clinching nomination: Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is on the ballot Tuesday, too. Remember, he still hasn't acquired the delegates needed to officially put him over the top for the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of doing that. With 500 at stake Tuesday, Biden needs 85% of them Tuesday to clinch. That's unlikely, so look at next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote — with their 133 delegates up for grabs — for Biden to hit the magic number of 1,991. (Follow all the math here with the NPR delegate tracker.) 5. Origins of Trump campaign investigation to be probed: In Congress, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into members of the 2016 Trump campaign. The Senate is also expected to vote on nominations, including for the Treasury Department's inspector general for the pandemic response. And action is possible on changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. Last week, the House, nearly unanimously, passed a bill that reduces the percentage of the loans that businesses have to use toward payroll and gives businesses more time to spend the money and to pay the loans back. Flashback quotation: ""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, 'Please don't be too nice.' When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head]. Like, 'Don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?' "" — Trump, on July 28, 2017, speaking to law enforcement officers in Long Island, N.Y. : 5/31/20 A previous version of this story misspelled Freddie Gray's first name as Freddy.",0.0

Protests were held throughout the city over the death of George Floyd, a black man in police custody in Minneapolis who died after being restrained by police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — George Floyd’s brother pleaded for peace in the streets Monday, saying destruction is “not going to bring my brother back at all,” while President Donald Trump berated most of the nation’s governors as “weak” for not cracking down harder on the lawlessness that has convulsed cities from coast to coast. The competing messages — one conciliatory, one bellicose — came as the U.S. braced for another round of violence at a time when the country is already buckling because of the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. “We are a country that is scared. We are a country that is angry,” said Sam Page, county executive in St. Louis County, Missouri, where the city of Ferguson has been synonymous with the Black Lives Matter movement since the 2014 death of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old, in a clash with a white officer. “And we are a country that is holding out for the promise of justice for all.” In Minneapolis, Floyd’s brother, Terrence, made an emotional plea at the site where Floyd was pinned to the pavement by an officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said. The crowd chanted, “What’s his name? George Floyd!” and “One down, three to go!” in reference to the four officers involved in Floyd’s arrest. Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. The gathering was part rally and part impromptu eulogy as Floyd urged people to stop the violence and use their power at the ballot box. “If I’m not over here messing up my community, then what are you all doing?” he said. “You all are doing nothing. Because that’s not going to bring my brother back at all.” The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred in part by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.”a Washington Gov.

He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” Meanwhile, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. That distinguishes it from the official autopsy, which said he died from the effects of being restrained along with underlying health problems and potential intoxicants in his system. The official autopsy found nothing “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” The second autopsy was done by a doctor who also examined the body of Eric Garner, a New York man who died in an officer’s chokehold six years ago. As it girded for more violence, New York joined other cities in announcing a curfew, set to begin at 11 p.m. The move followed a chaotic Sunday night in which groups of people broke into Chanel, Prada and Rolex boutiques and electronics stores. At the same time, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the law-breaking in the city of 8.3 million people was “fomented by a very small number of violent protesters.” At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis. While police in places tried to ease tensions by kneeling or marching in solidarity with the demonstrators, officers around the country were accused of treating protesters with the same kind of heavy-handed tactics that contributed to the unrest in the first place. Cities struggled to keep police in line. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an officer was suspended for pushing a kneeling woman to the ground during a protest. In Atlanta, two officers were fired after bashing in the window of a car and using a stun gun on the occupants. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters, knocking two people to the ground. In New York, the police commissioner said about six incidents were being investigated by the department’s internal affairs bureau, including a weekend confrontation in Brooklyn in which two police vehicles appeared to plow through a group of protesters. In another incident, an officer pointed a gun at protesters, drawing condemnation from the mayor. “I think some of the actions of the NYPD have exacerbated the anger,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. “There are videos of some NYPD actions that are very disturbing. There are videos of NYPD cars driving into a crowd that are very disturbing.

(WRIC) — Richmond experienced three nights of protests and riots this weekend resulting in the destruction of property, looting, fires and arrests. The protests were in response to the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video being pinned down by three Minneapolis police officers while in custody. One officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on Floyd’s neck as he continuously yelled in distress. Chauvin was fired for his actions and has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Nationwide outrage at the event led to protests and riots in cities across the nation, including Richmond. In a press conference on Sunday, Richmond Police Chief William Smith said that police are looking into whether or not people from outside of the area had traveled to Richmond for the riots and were responsible for instigating some of the violence. Friday night protest leads to a riot that lasted into early Saturday morning A GRTC Pulse bus was burnt during the first night of protests and riots in Richmond. On Friday evening, what started as a peaceful protest turned into a riot in downtown Richmond. As a result of the violence, stores were looted, buildings around Capital Square were damaged and a police car and GRTC Pulse bus were set on fire. In response to the riot, Capital Square was closed to the public on Saturday and GRTC started service late on Saturday, and then later suspended service from 8 p.m. Saturday through Sunday night. While no one was injured during the bus burning, GRTC said it didn’t want tot take any chances. “The safety of our staff and passengers is the most important factor in determining service levels. We can replace property, but we can’t replace people,” said Julie Timm, GRTC Chief Executive Officer. Mayor Levar Stoney condemned the violence saying “two wrongs don’t make a right.” “We welcome folks to come and peacefully protest and peacefully demonstrate,” Stoney said on Saturday. “However, what I was taught as a young man, which still follows me to this day, is that two wrongs don’t make a right. Two wrongs do not make a right. The injustice that occurred to George Floyd and others — that is wrong. The destruction of property, the damage to property — that is wrong as well. Two injustices don’t make a right. That doesn’t create justice.” Capital Square was closed after buildings around it were damaged during Friday night’s riots and protests, Saturday, May 30. On Saturday, protests again led to riots that lasted into Sunday morning Saturday night’s demonstration again devolved into riots with fires around the city and hundreds of people marching along Broad and Belvidere streets holding signs and chanting. The Saturday night riot was the largest of the three nights. Capital Police told 8News that two officers were taken to VCU Medical Center on Saturday night for leg injuries after they were struck by objects thrown by people gathered outside of Capital Square’s main gate shortly after 9 p.m. One officer was hit by a baseball bat and the other by a beer bottle. Police sources also told 8News that Wells Fargo on E. Grace Street near Richmond Police Headquarters was broken into. And according to reports, the windows at Boost mobile on W. Broad Street were smashed as well. This dumpster fire was near the corner of E. Grace and 3rd streets, Saturday, May 30.

(WFXR) –Amid this weekend’s protests, a Forest brewery announced a decision Sunday to suspend food operations with a Lynchburg restaurant following a controversial tweet earlier in the week. More than 100 people gathered outside Fifth and Federal Station in Lynchburg on Sunday, May 31 for a protest that lasted into the early morning hours on Monday, June 1. The protest revolved around the the issue of “Black Lives Matter” versus “All Lives Matter” that sparked from a reply to a tweet that Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr. posted on Wednesday, May 27. If you get extra made let us know! We would offer them to our staff as a mask option! — Fifth & Federal (@Fifthandfederal) May 27, 2020 Falwell’s tweet expressed his opposition to Gov. Ralph Northam’s mandate for all Virginia citizens to wear masks in public places. Falwell responded, “I will reluctantly comply, but only if this picture of Governor Blackface himself is on it,” sharing a picture of the blackface yearbook photo that sparked controversy last year. In response to the tweet, Fifth and Federal replied Wednesday, “If you get extra made let us know! We would offer them to our staff as a mask option!” On Sunday afternoon, Apocalypse Ale Works and Beer Garden announced on Facebook the suspension of food operations at the beer garden, which is where Fifth and Federal served food on Fridays and Saturdays. “We have been made aware and are deeply disappointed by the statements made by 5th and Federal’s Twitter,” Apocalypse Ale Works and Beer Garden posted on Sunday. “Although they serve out of our location on Friday & Saturday, we are separate entities and in absolutely NO WAY condone any kind of racist symbolism, or behavior.” In addition, protesters gathered outside Fifth and Federal on Sunday and chanted “Cancel Fifth and Federal.” Owner Josh Read declined to comment on Sunday, but said he would later send a statement. However, the protest eventually turned violent over the course of the night, with Lynchburg police officers and state troopers at the scene to warn protesters to leave or get arrested around 1 a.m. on Monday before deploying smoke a few minutes later. Over the course of the night, several Lynchburg police officers were injured — including one who ended up being hospitalized — and two people were arrested. “The LPD respects the right to peacefully protest. When those protests turn violent and threaten the safety of our community, we must take action, as we did tonight,” the Lynchburg Police Department stated in a news release on Monday, June 1. “Failing to take action would threaten the safety of the peaceful protesters, the uninvolved public, and our officers.” Property damage can also be seen next door at Adams Motor Company. @WFXRnews pic.twitter.com/Ybg8rLYlEL — Breana Albizu WFXR (@BreanaAlbizu) June 1, 2020 On Monday morning, WFXR’s Breana Albizu visited Fifth and Federal Station and found broken windows, scattered bricks, torn signs, and more, with damage even extending to the neighboring Adams Motor Company.

1622164298,2020-06-01 07:13:10,US heads into a new week shaken by violence and pandemic,https://www.wavy.com/news/national/us-heads-into-a-new-week-shaken-by-violence-and-pandemic/,en,True,,70270,wavy.com,http://www.wavy.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON (AP) — With cities wounded by days of violent unrest, America headed into a new week with neighborhoods in shambles, urban streets on lockdown and shaken confidence about when leaders would find the answers to control the mayhem amid unrelenting raw emotion over police killings of black people. All of it smashed into a nation already bludgeoned by a death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surging past 100,000 and unemployment that soared to levels not seen since the Great Depression. Sunday capped a tumultuous weekend and month that saw city and state officials deploy thousands of National Guard soldiers, enact strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems. Even with those efforts, many demonstrations erupted into violence as protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin and several other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry, leaving shop owners, many of them just ramping up their business again after coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, to clean up their shattered storefronts. In others, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators, while still maintaining a strong presence for security.

(Photo by JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images) The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. Floyd’s death in Minneapolis came after tensions had already flared after two white men were arrested in May for the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and the Louisville police shooting death of Breonna Taylor in her home in March, which also attracted national attention in May. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name.” Tensions rose Sunday outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The district’s entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said t wo officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, and using stun guns on the man and woman inside. In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, scores swarmed into nearby outlet stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags, while a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd’s neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” Among those in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said.",0.0

Some police action has been directed against people smashing windows, breaking into stores and burning cars, but many find other instances more difficult to understand "" like the elderly man knocked over by police as he walked with a cane on a Salt Lake City sidewalk. The protests began after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer who is now charged with murder, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Now, some are questioning whether tough police tactics against demonstrators are actually making the violence worse rather than quelling it. While the protests and subsequent police interactions may be shocking to some, many African Americans aren't surprised because they've endured police brutality for decades, said Chris White, director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, 'What's happening, it's the way American society has always been,' White said. U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, who was hit by pepper spray Saturday as scuffles broke out near the end of a demonstration in Columbus, Ohio, said police escalated matters by using heavy-handed tactics against 'passionate' young demonstrators who were mostly orderly. 'Too much force is not the answer to this,' said Beatty, who pressed for peaceful tactics on both sides in a video posted on Twitter by Columbus City Council president Shannon Hardin, who also was pepper-sprayed. Both are African American. In Salt Lake City, a police officer shoved and knocked over an older man who was walking with a cane on a sidewalk near a protest. Another officer stepped in within seconds to assist the man, as did the officer who knocked him down. Police Chief Mike Brown issued a video Sunday saying he'd personally apologized to the man. 'It was hard for me to watch what happened, and I know it was even harder for him to experience it,' Brown said. In New York, where video showed two police vehicles driving into a crowd, knocking aside demonstrators, Mayor Bill de Blasio decried what he called ""structural racism"" that leads to violence against minorities, but also defended police. 'It is inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers,' he said. 'That's wrong on its face and that hasn't happened in the history of protests in this city.' Two police officers in Atlanta were fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest incident involving two college students Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Sunday that she and the police chief made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage. Footage shown on TV as captured by local reporters shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat. The officers pull the woman out and appear to use a stun gun on the man. They use zip-tie handcuffs on the woman on the ground. In a message some saw as encouraging police violence, President Donald Trump praised U.S. Secret Service officers guarding the White House amid demonstrations and said any protesters who breached its fence would face 'the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That's when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.' In a letter titled 'Dear America,' civil rights leader Rev. William Barber II, a pastor at Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, said protesters have the right to decry 'brutal and inhumane' treatment at the hands of police. 'What if, instead of a President who tweets 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts,' we had leadership that could unequivocally say, 'When you use police power in the name of the state to murder, lynch, and destroy, you will be prosecuted for your crimes,'"" Barber wrote. Trump wasn't alone in using loaded language. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety sent a tweet Saturday saying it would strengthen its response to 'a sophisticated network of urban warfare.' Hours later, video emerged of police shooting paint projectiles at people gathered on the front porch of a home after curfew in Minneapolis. 'Light 'em up,' a man is heard saying before the shooting began. No one appeared seriously injured. Activist Meeko Williams organized a peaceful demonstration in Detroit on Friday and later traveled to Minnesota to help support organizers there. Trying to understand what he sees as increasingly aggressive law enforcement tactics, Williams said police shouldn't 'antagonize, provoke or instigate' protesters. 'I don't know what's going to happen over these next few days in this country because they want these killer cops arrested and they're not going to stop until they are,' Williams said, referring to the lack of charges against the other three officers at the scene when Floyd's neck was pinned under Chauvin's knee. 'People are just sick and tired of being in this predicament, where innocent life has been taken at the hands of those who were to protect and serve us. We have not been heard.' Some protesters are increasing efforts to protect themselves. On Sunday, Black Lives Matter organizers in Tampa, Florida, had nearly 100 safety marshals in fluorescent vests patrolling their march, trained in de-escalation tactics. The group also had medics and enlisted lawyers and those with legal training to watch out for protesters' rights from the sidelines. In New York, a police labor group, the Detectives' Endowment Association, noted some police there had been attacked and patrol cars set ablaze. 'As we do everything to stop NYC from burning, all we hear from elected officials is criticism,"" the group tweeted. 'Maybe they should try it on the front lines.' ___ Reeves and Stafford are members of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team. Reeves reported from Birmingham, Alabama, and Stafford from Detroit.",0.0

ATLANTA (WSAV) – Atlanta’s mayor says two city police investigators have been fired and three officers are on desk duty following an arrest Saturday involving two college students. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms says the police used excessive force while arresting Messiah Young and Taniyah Pilgrim, students at Morehouse College and Spelman College respectively. Now identified as Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter, the investigators were part of the Atlanta Police Department’s (APD) Fugitive Unit.

Bottoms said Pilgrim was released without charges and that she was ordering the charges against Young to be dropped. The mayor said she and APD Chief Erika Shields made the decision to fire the officers after reviewing body-camera footage. “Use of excessive force is never acceptable,” Bottoms told reporters Sunday. Shields called the footage “really shocking to watch” and apologized to the students. Saturday night, more than 150 people were arrested for various violations during the protest, according to the mayor.

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

Stuart monument and other Confederate statues in Richmond, spray-painting profanities and phrases such as ""No more white supremacy."" Following nights of heated and violent nationwide protests in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Gov. Ralph Northam has declared a state of emergency and activated the state National Guard to assist local law enforcement in quelling “escalating violence across the commonwealth.” “This emergency declaration will provide the necessary support to localities as they work to keep our communities safe,” said Northam, citing civil unrest taking place over the weekend in Richmond, Roanoke and Prince William County. “There are many voices speaking out for justice and healing across the United States and in our commonwealth, but others are exploiting this pain and inciting violence.” In Richmond, where a GRTC bus and the Daughters of the Confederacy building were set aflame and protesters broke windows in some downtown businesses and defaced the city’s Confederate monuments with graffiti, city Mayor Levar Stoney received permission from Northam to institute a nightly 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew through Wednesday, June 3. Richmond is one of more than 20 cities nationwide under curfew in response to the widespread protests over police brutality against African Americans and other people of color. “The past two nights, we’ve seen what could have been peaceful protests turn violent and destructive,” said Stoney. “We’re taking these steps to promote lawful and safe demonstration and protect both people and property.” While many protesters across the nation have been peaceful, there has also been looting, arson and violence taking place on streets in more than 30 cities, from Philadelphia to Los Angeles. Police across the United States have deployed tear gas, flash bang grenades and rubber bullets against protesters and members of the media, while protesters in several cities have lobbed bottles and rocks at police and set fire to police cars and other property. According to the governor’s emergency declaration, damage in Richmond has included “the burning of two buildings, vehicle fires, debris and dumpster fires, vandalism, looting and … damage to law enforcement vehicles. ” In Hampton Roads, Black Lives Matter 757 protesters shut down the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel and a stretch of Interstate 64 for about an hour Friday night. The curfew in Richmond prohibits people from being present in any public place, including roadways, between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. unless they are: traveling to or from home, work or a place of worship; hospital staff; members of the press; state or city of Richmond employees or volunteers; military personnel, including National Guard troops; emergency medical transit workers; or other emergency workers.  Those caught violating curfew can be charged with a class one misdemeanor. Four Minneapolis police officers were fired and former officer Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the May 25 killing of George Floyd during an arrest that bystanders recorded on video, which received international news coverage and went viral on social media. Chauvin kneeled on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, seemingly ignoring Floyd’s pleas of “I can’t breathe.” Subscribe to Virginia Business. Advertisement",0.0

MINNEAPOLIS — Protesters took to the streets across America again Sunday, with violence flaring in pockets of largely peaceful demonstrations fueled by the killings of black people at the hands of police. A truck driver — apparently deliberately — drove into demonstrators in Minneapolis nearly a week after George Floyd pleaded with an officer pressing a knee into his neck that he could not breathe. An Associated Press tally shows at least 4,100 people arrested over days of protests since killing of George Floyd. Protests sprang up from Boston to San Francisco, with people robbing stores in broad daylight in Philadelphia and Santa Monica, California. In Minneapolis, the tanker truck sped into a peaceful crowd of thousands on a closed highway, but no protesters appeared to have been hit, authorities said. The Minnesota State Patrol tweeted that the driver was apparently trying to provoke protesters and was arrested. Protesters swarmed the truck and jumped on the hood, even as it kept moving. Police then came in force to clear the highway in the city where violence erupted after last week's death of Floyd, a black man. The protests quickly became national, spreading to dozens of cities large and small, and have lasted for days. The officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck for several minutes has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. In neighboring St. Paul, thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol, pledging to keep up the protests. “We’re Minnesota nice, but we’re not Minnesota dumb, and we’re not done,” St. Paul Black Lives Matter organizer Darnella Wade said. “They sent us the military and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota's governor brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. The immense deployment appeared to have worked Saturday night, when there was comparatively little destruction. On Sunday, in a display of force, long lines of state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers were lined up in front of the Capitol, facing the demonstrators, with perhaps a dozen military-style armored vehicles behind them. Tensions were heightened Sunday as a second group of demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota sought to join others already at Lafayette Park near the White House but were blocked by police. Police used pepper pods and flash bangs to try to disperse the crowd, but the demonstrators held tight. The protesters sought to engage black police officers, seeking their support. “I been fighting this fight for 40 years. I been fighting this fight since the 80s. Do you think being on the outside is the solution or being on the inside and changing things is the solution,” he asked them. Gabrielle Labrosse-Ellis, 30, from Maryland, held a sign that said, “Humanize black lives.” “This is unacceptable. This is the last straw,” she said. “It has to be.” Labrosse-Ellis said she planned to leave before dark because she feared a repeat of the violence that occurred Saturday night. Outside Lafayette Park, protesters were milling around near cleaning crews who were clearing glass and boarding up windows that were broken during Saturday night’s protest Across America, demonstrators called again for an end to police violence. “They keep killing our people,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston. “I’m so sick and tired of it.” Many also joined police in pleading for a stop to violence, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. “It only hurts the cause,” said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed the heart of the city. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. Among those descending on Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said. County Commissioner Angela Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who held his knee on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. “We’ll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,” Conley said. In tweets Sunday, President Donald Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. The fury also spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. Buildings around the U.S. were defaced with spray-painted messages, from the facade of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd's gasped last words — “I can't breathe” — were repeated, alongside anti-police messages. Crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. ___",0.0
1622241705,2020-06-01 08:14:09,Federal officials investigating if  extremist groups infiltrated protests,https://www.wfxrtv.com/news/national-news/federal-officials-investigating-if-extremist-groups-infiltrated-protests/,en,True,,576666,virginiafirst.com,http://virginiafirst.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a “very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.” President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There’s a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it’s not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia.” Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even as he cried he couldn’t breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials.

Protests across the country have escalated over the death of George Floyd who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day, May 25. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) Nearly 26,000 nursing home residents in the United States have died from COVID-19, according to the report prepared for the nation’s governors, a number that is partial and likely to go higher. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 60,000 cases of coronavirus illness among nursing home residents, according to a copy of the letter addressed to the governors and an accompanying chart provided to The Associated Press. The data was based on reports received from about 80% of the nation’s 15,400 nursing homes as of May 24. But some states with high rates of nursing home deaths appeared to have some of the lowest levels of response to the federal data-gathering survey, intended as a first step toward developing policy changes. “This data, and anecdotal reports across the country, clearly show that nursing homes have been devastated by the virus,” wrote CDC Director Robert Redfield and CMS Administrator Seema Verma. The U.S. has seen over 104,000 deaths and nearly 1.8 million infections in the pandemic, both count’s the highest in the world. And although the first wave of the pandemic may be easing in much of the U.S., that doesn’t mean nursing homes are in any less danger: Experts say in a virus rebound they can again become the stage for tragic scenes of death and despair, as well as a risk for the broader community. “What is going on in a nursing home can be a barometer for where the virus is,” said Tamara Konetzka, a research professor at the University of Chicago, who specializes in long-term care issues. As tourist destination worldwide reopened for business, new rules were in place to guard against the virus' spread. The Florida Keys welcomed visitors for the first time in two months, the Colosseum opened its ancient doors in Rome, ferries restarted in Bangladesh and golfers played in Greece. But even as the tourist-dependent Keys took down barriers to allow visitors, Miami-Dade County kept its beaches closed because of protests in South Florida and across the country over the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man pinned at the neck by a white police officer in Minneapolis. Roadblocks were taken down shortly after midnight near Key Largo, the northernmost island in the Florida chain, where almost half of all workers are employed by hotels, bars and other hospitality industries, and many of the rest are involved in commercial and sport fishing. Richard Stanczyk, owner of Bud N’ Mary’s marina in Islamorada, said the 40 captains who operate fishing boats out of the 76-year-old business have had virtually no customers for weeks and welcomed the reopening. “There has been a real uptick in phone calls. There have been more charter bookings,” Stanczyk said. “We are encouraged. It’s going to come back.” Yet the carefree, party atmosphere that surrounds the Keys and was popularized by singer Jimmy Buffet in songs like “Margaritaville” may not return for some time. The Monroe County Tourist Development Council made clear on its website that visitors must adhere to health guidelines. “Bring facial coverings, gloves, hand sanitizer, reef-safe sunscreen and personal essential medicines. If you’re feeling unwell, please stay home,” it said. Countries around the Mediterranean Sea also tentatively kicked off a summer season where tourists could bask in their famously sunny beaches with distancing measures in place. “We are reopening a symbol. A symbol of Rome, a symbol for Italy,” said Alfonsina Russo, director of the Colosseum’s archaeological park. “(We are) restarting in a positive way, with a different pace, with a more sustainable tourism.” Greece lifted lockdown measures for hotels, campsites, open-air cinemas, golf courses and public swimming pools, while b eaches and museums reopened in Turkey and bars, restaurants, cinemas and museums came back to life in the Netherlands. “Today, we opened two rooms and tomorrow three. It’s like building an anthill,” Athens hotel owner Panos Betis said as employees wearing face masks tidied a rooftop restaurant and cleaned a window facing the ancient Acropolis. “Our aim now is to hang in there until 2021."" A long line of masked visitors snaked outside the Vatican Museums, which include the Sistine Chapel, as they reopened for the first time in three months. The Vatican Museums’ famous keyholder — the “clavigero” who holds the keys to all the galleries on a big ring on his wrist — opened the gate in a sign both symbolic and literal that the Museums were back in business. Still, strict crowd control measures were in place: Visitors needed reservations, their temperatures were taken before entering and masks were mandatory. The Dutch relaxation of coronavirus rules took place on a major holiday with the sun blazing, raising fears of overcrowding in popular beach resorts. The new rules let bars and restaurants serve up to 30 people inside if they keep social distancing, but there was no standing at bars and reservations were necessary. Britain, which has the world's second-worst death toll behind the United States, eased restrictions despite warnings from health officials that the risk of spreading COVID-19 was still too great. Some elementary classes reopened and people could have limited contact with family and friends, but only outdoors and with social distancing. Around 6.19 million infections have been reported worldwide, with over 372,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many died without ever being tested. In the U.S., the often-violent protests over Floyd's death raised fears of new outbreaks in a country where the pandemic has disproportionately affected racial minorities. Protests have shaken cities from New York to Los Angeles, with d emonstrators packed cheek by jowl, many without masks, shouting or singing. The virus is spread by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, talk or sing. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo expressed concern Monday the protests in New York City could imperil the long, hard fight to contain the pandemic in a worldwide hot spot. “You turn on the TV and you see these mass gatherings that could potentially be infecting hundreds and hundreds of people after everything that we have done,” Cuomo said. “We have to take a minute and ask ourselves: ’What are we doing here?” ___ Anderson reported from St. Petersburg, Florida.

(WAVY) — Virginia reported 791 new COVID-19 cases and 17 new deaths on Monday morning as the state’s percent of positive tests continues to trend downward. The new numbers come after a weekend of large gatherings in Virginia to protest the killing of George Floyd and other African Americans across the country at the hands of police. The large groups of people tightly packed together have led to fears of a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, but those cases likely won’t appear on the Virginia Department of Health’s website for about two weeks. Virginia’s percent positivity rate has dropped to nearly 10% overall as testing increases, with Northern Virginia still above 15%. The rest of the state has numbers under or just above 10% for nearly a month. Most of the new cases continue to come from Northern Virginia, which just joined the rest of the state in phase 1 last week. Tidewater accounted for just over 100 of the 791 cases statewide, around 13% (more on that below). Hospitalizations are back down under 1,400 (1,371) after going up as much as 1,524 patients last Friday, May 29. Deaths are also continuing to trend down after peaking in late April/early May. Here’s the latest update for Tidewater: Accomack: 917 cases, 49 hospitalized, 12 deaths (+8 cases, +1 hospitalized) Chesapeake: 535 cases, 88 hospitalized, 15 deaths (+14 cases, +1 hospitalized) Franklin: 42 cases, 3 hospitalized, 2 deaths (no new cases) Gloucester: 31 cases, 8 hospitalized, 1 death (no new cases) Hampton: 210 cases, 30 hospitalized, 3 deaths (+3 cases) Isle of Wight: 128 cases, 12 hospitalized, 3 deaths (no new cases) James City County: 206 cases, 54 hospitalized, 15 deaths (+1 case) Mathews: 5 cases, 2 hospitalized, 0 deaths Newport News: 282 cases, 40 hospitalized, 10 deaths (+9 cases) Norfolk: 521 cases, 69 hospitalized, 6 deaths (+18 cases) Northampton: 241 cases 28 hospitalized, 23 deaths (+4 cases) Poquoson: 8 cases, 2 hospitalized, 0 deaths (no new cases) Portsmouth: 313 cases, 44 hospitalized, 11 deaths (+5 cases) Southampton: 147 cases, 6 hospitalized, 2 deaths (no new cases) Suffolk: 316 cases, 50 hospitalized, 32 deaths (+1 case) Virginia Beach: 745 cases, 94 hospitalized, 23 deaths (+37 cases) Williamsburg: 44 cases, 10 hospitalized, 4 deaths (no new cases) York: 77 cases, 9 hospitalized, 3 deaths (+3 cases) Quick takeaways: No new deaths reported across the region Tidewater accounted for just over 100 of the 791 cases statewide, around 13%. Virginia Beach saw its highest number of cases reported per day of the pandemic (37), though that high figure may be due to weekend reporting lags. It still has about a 3% positivity rate. No new deaths reported in Northampton County (population of about 12,000), which now has the same number of COVID-19 deaths (23) as Virginia Beach, but 3 were reported on Sunday. Norfolk has reported over 100 new cases in the past week. It has the highest positivity rate of the 7 cities with 7.8%. For more information from VDH, click here.",0.0

(NEXSTAR/AP) – After six straight days of unrest, America heads into a new work week with neighborhoods in shambles, urban streets on lockdown and political leaders struggling to control the coast-to-coast outpouring of rage over police killings of black people. Despite curfews in big cities across the U.S. and the deployment of thousands of National Guard soldiers over the past week, demonstrations descended into violence again on Sunday.

Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin, Texas, and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them first, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis.

In other places, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators. The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Breonna Taylor to death in her home in March. The upheaval has unfolded amid the gloom and economic ruin caused by the coronavirus, which has killed over 100,000 Americans and sent unemployment soaring to levels not seen since the Depression. The outbreak has hit minorities especially hard, not just in infections and deaths but in job losses and economic stress. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests has rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count compiled by The Associated Press. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name!” Protesters hold signs in Detroit, Michigan on May 31, 2020 following a night of protests that saw several arrests and use of tear gas by the Detroit Police department. (Photo by SETH HERALD/AFP via Getty Images) At the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, police fired tear gas and stun grenades Sunday into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a street nearby. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the flames. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office was burned down. The district’s entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to Pentagon officials. As the unrest grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton, who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to demonstrators. He also wrote a post online expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. In New York, thieves raided luxury stores, including Chanel, Rolex and Prada boutiques. In Birmingham, Alabama, a Confederate statute was toppled.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Thousands marched peacefully in Phoenix; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying the destruction weakens calls for justice and reform. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said t wo officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday and using stun guns on the man and woman inside. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. Scores of people swarmed into stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) In Minneapolis, the officer who pinned Floyd to the pavement has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest, but thousands marching on a closed freeway were shaken when a tractor-trailer rolled into their midst. No serious injuries were reported. The driver was arrested on suspicion of assault. In tweets Sunday, Trump accused anarchists and the media of fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems.

""They kept asking, 'Do you have any proof?'"" he said. ""And I said, 'Yeah, look at my face and look at his face.' You can tell."" Floyd and his sister praised local protesters for hosting peaceful demonstrations and denounced the violence that has unfolded in other cities. ""The violence is not the right way to do it.

Hundreds of people gathered in downtown Richmond for a third night to protest the murder of George Floyd, a black man, who died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes while other officers stood by. It was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in America. Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney issued a curfew for the city of Richmond after calling the last two nights of unrest in Richmond an “insult to the cause” as some turned to violence while protesters took to the streets to demand justice for George Floyd. The mayor held a press conference Sunday morning accompanied by members of Richmond City Council and announced that Governor Northam had granted his request for a curfew to begin at 8 p.m. Sunday. The curfew will run until 6 a.m. nightly through Wednesday, June 3. The road near Richmond Police Department’s headquarters was blocked off by police in riot gear from Richmond, Henrico and Chesterfield, as well as the National Guard. There were also armored vehicles out and RPD headquarters were boarded up and have been since Friday. Police were out arresting people who were out past curfew and police said approximately two dozen people were arrested. At one point, witnesses said that some in the crowd started fighting and then several rounds of gunfire were heard. Police said no one was injured. NBC12 crews were in the area when it happened and were recording when the gunfire went off. Monument Avenue saw a lot of activity over the past few days. Protesters were there peacefully Sunday after many of the statues were covered in graffiti.

While reporting, viewers witnessed an armed police officer shove a man with a cane to the ground. Shortly after, other officers helped the man to his feet. “We have spent hours sifting through the footage to identify the officer involved, we know who it is and we have begun the investigation,” said Brown. “I have seen the video, and it was inappropriate.” Brown said they will follow their proceedures which includes and internal affairs investigation as well as a review by the civilian review board who will then provide a recommendation to him. “I want to say this is not what I would expect from Salt Lake City PD,” said Brown. “My expectations are that if people are excercising their first ammendment rights, we give them the space to do so peacefully.” Brown said he has spoken to the man seen in the video to express his concern for his well being and to apologize to him directly. “It was hard for me to watch what happened, and I know it was even harder for him to experience it,” said Brown. Brown additionally stated that “overwhelmingly he saw exemplarly professionalism and thank all the officers for the hours upon hours of standing in the sweltering heat in all their protective gear.” Brown said he was relieved that under the reality of the situation that there were no fatalities. “My heart aches for the pain caused and insecure feelings that we have experienced over the last 24 hours here in Salt Lake City,” Said Brown. “We understand that this insecure feeling pails in comparison to the overarching original reason for the protest.” Brown said they reiterate their committment to stamping out systemic racism.

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) MIAMI – Fort Lauderdale police suspended an officer after video showed he pushed a kneeling black woman to the ground during protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, escalating a clash where bottles were thrown and tear gas was fired. Also in Fort Lauderdale, the state attorney's office fired a prosecutor Monday for calling demonstrators “animals"" at the zoo in a quickly deleted Facebook post. In the officer's case, colleagues quickly pushed him away from the woman and down the street Sunday. Police and city officials said it happened as a peaceful demonstration attended by about 1,000 people was dispersing, and smaller groups broke some store windows and sprayed graffiti. Police Chief Rick Maglione did not defend the actions of Officer Steven Pohorence, but said Monday that Pohorence pushed the woman after he and other officers had just rescued one colleague who had become surrounded and another from a patrol car that people began jumping on. Maglione said Pohorence's actions will be investigated by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement before an internal investigation is conducted. Maglione said he understands why some believe the shove provoked the crowd to throw bottles, but he said there were people in the crowd with bricks, bottles, fireworks and other weapons who were hoping to start a fight with officers. “I don't think (Pohorence's) action created what occurred,” the chief said. But he said Pohorence's actions “could have added to what was going on,"" and he commended Officer Krystle Smith who pushed Pohorence away from the woman. “She did what you are supposed to do: When you see either adrenaline or emotion or some kind of interaction going south ... that is our job to do, is intervene,” he said. Police declined to make Smith available for an interview Monday. Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis said he felt the Pohorence’s actions were “offensive,” and he’s happy the department has suspended him. Demonstrator Samantha Sweeting Davis said she didn't see the shove, but heard yelling, then saw about six police cars arrive with sirens on. Then she saw bottles being thrown at officers, heard an explosion, and tear gas burned her eyes and throat. It was upsetting to see that kind of behavior from an officer who is supposed to “protect and serve,” the 29-year-old high school counselor from Fort Lauderdale said. “Suspension is a great first step, but honestly I want to see the officer de-badged."" The Fort Lauderdale Fraternal Order of Police, the union that represents the city's officers, declined comment Monday. Meanwhile, the State Attorney's Office in Broward County, fired prosecutor Amy Bloom for writing on Facebook: “Act civilized and maybe things will change. I’ve never seen such animals except at the zoo.” She said her description applied to protesters regardless of race. The South Florida Sun Sentinel reported Bloom quickly deleted the post, but someone copied it and it eventually reached her bosses. The State Attorney's Office confirmed the firing in a statement, saying her views are “entirely inconsistent” with its “ideals and principles.” Bloom said Monday on Facebook that she realized the post could be misinterpreted, deleted it within seconds and that ""I believe in justice for all and that ALL lives matter."" A curfew remains in effect in Broward County. Elsewhere in Florida, mostly peaceful protests were held over the weekend, but some Miami police cars were burned and storefronts damaged. That led Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez to postpone Monday's reopening of the county's beaches after a coronavirus shutdown. Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Monday that 700 national guard troops and 1,300 Florida Highway Patrol troopers are being deployed to help local law enforcement. “Florida has zero tolerance for violence, rioting and looting. George Floyd’s murder was appalling, and the Minnesota perpetrators need to be brought to justice, but this cannot be used as a pretext for violence in our Florida communities,"" DeSantis said in a statement to media and on Twitter. In Orlando, Police Chief Orlando Rolon said Monday that officers had to fire tear gas Sunday night after some demonstrators started throwing objects found at a highway construction site. He said his officers made 30 arrests Sunday night, including some who broke into stores. At one point during Sunday’s protests, Rolon and Orange County Sheriff John Mina knelt in solidarity with protesters outside the Orlando Police Department. In Tampa on Monday, six members of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity prayed outside two businesses, Saigon Vietnamese Restaurant and Champs Sports, that were destroyed by arson on Saturday. Pastor James Gallon said the people who were destructive were from elsewhere. “Then they leave and drive away on the interstate,"" he said. ___ Associated Press reporters Adriana Gomez Licon in Miami; Freida Frisaro Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Mike Schneider in Orlando, Florida; Tamara Lush in Tampa, Florida; and Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee contributed to this report.",0.0

At least two dozen people were detained by police Sunday night as police and the National Guard swept downtown streets on the first night of a curfew activated by Gov. Ralph Northam. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports police used tear gas and pepper spray on demonstrators, who started marching downtown from the defaced Robert E. Lee statue shortly after the curfew took effect. After the arrests broke up the large group of protesters, small pockets of people gathered around downtown and the Virginia Commonwealth University campus. Meanwhile, a man who was hit by gunfire while riding in a car near protesters early Sunday morning remained hospitalized for a life-threatening gunshot wound, police said. Police said gunfire shot from behind the car struck the man as he passed through protesters. Authorities learned about the shooting after being called to a hospital where the man was being treated. Authorities did not identify the victim. Northam activated the National Guard in a state of emergency declaration issued Sunday afternoon. Some protesters sprayed graffiti, including “Say His Name” and “George Floyd.” But there were fewer instances of vandalism Sunday. Businesses along Broad Street and elsewhere covered their windows with plywood after numerous businesses were vandalized Saturday and several of the city’s Confederate monuments were covered in graffiti. Peaceful protests occurred throughout the day Sunday before the demonstration that ultimately ended in arrests, with many protesters decrying the violence and destruction caused by rioters the night before. In Virginia Beach, tensions escalated Sunday night as hundreds marched. The Virginian-Pilot reports that police lined Atlantic Avenue in riot gear and appeared to deploy tear gas. Several Oceanfront businesses were damaged, according to social media posts. “At approximately 9:45 p.m., a small portion of the marchers began to participate in criminal behavior resulting in police enforcement,” police said in a statement. The protests in Virginia were similar to those across the nation in response to Floyd’s death in Minneapolis last week.

(NEXSTAR/AP) – After six straight days of unrest, America heads into a new work week with neighborhoods in shambles, urban streets on lockdown and political leaders struggling to control the coast-to-coast outpouring of rage over police killings of black people. Despite curfews in big cities across the U.S. and the deployment of thousands of National Guard soldiers over the past week, demonstrations descended into violence again on Sunday.

Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin, Texas, and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them first, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis.

In other places, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators. The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Breonna Taylor to death in her home in March. The upheaval has unfolded amid the gloom and economic ruin caused by the coronavirus, which has killed over 100,000 Americans and sent unemployment soaring to levels not seen since the Depression. The outbreak has hit minorities especially hard, not just in infections and deaths but in job losses and economic stress. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests has rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count compiled by The Associated Press. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name!” Protesters hold signs in Detroit, Michigan on May 31, 2020 following a night of protests that saw several arrests and use of tear gas by the Detroit Police department. (Photo by SETH HERALD/AFP via Getty Images) At the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, police fired tear gas and stun grenades Sunday into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a street nearby. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the flames. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office was burned down. The district’s entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to Pentagon officials. As the unrest grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton, who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to demonstrators. He also wrote a post online expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. In New York, thieves raided luxury stores, including Chanel, Rolex and Prada boutiques. In Birmingham, Alabama, a Confederate statute was toppled.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Thousands marched peacefully in Phoenix; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying the destruction weakens calls for justice and reform. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said t wo officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday and using stun guns on the man and woman inside. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. Scores of people swarmed into stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) In Minneapolis, the officer who pinned Floyd to the pavement has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest, but thousands marching on a closed freeway were shaken when a tractor-trailer rolled into their midst. No serious injuries were reported. The driver was arrested on suspicion of assault. In tweets Sunday, Trump accused anarchists and the media of fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems.

Stacey O’Hara says this was supposed to be a peaceful protest. It started Sunday afternoon and she says by 10 p.m., there were at least 90 people and tensions were high between police, protestors and the armed citizens trying to Fifth & Federal Station. “Right before I left, people started challenging police ... almost like they’re trying to hurt them and ... at that point I was begging, pleading, ‘please step back please don’t do this,’” said O’Hara. O’Hara said shortly after, she left for her safety because it had gotten too out of hand. She teared up this morning seeing the damage and knowing people were hurt. Windows at Anderson Motor Company had windows busted out by rocks, and other businesses were damaged throughout the night. 10 News spoke to a man who used to work at Fifth & Federal about a year ago who went downtown after seeing the vandalism on Facebook. “I love Lynchburg. I’m not taking any sides. I don’t think vandalizing Fifth & Federal s exactly a good idea, but I do think what the owner said was horrible poor business taste and poor moral taste,” said Mark Cash. Cash said that his girlfriend was working at the restaurant when protests started taking a turn. “When she arrived work ... the phone kept ringing and people were very aggressive, so I told her ‘you have to leave.’ So we called the owner and said ‘Chloe is locking it up and we’re leaving,’” said Cash.",0.0

1622490351,2020-06-01 12:53:52,Atlanta mayor: 2 officers fired in 'excessive force' arrests,https://www.wsls.com/news/2020/06/01/atlanta-mayor-2-officers-fired-in-excessive-force-arrests/,en,False,,90694,wsls.com,http://www.wsls.com/#spider,"ATLANTA – A college student dragged from a car by Atlanta police when she and her boyfriend were caught in traffic caused by a protest over the death of George Floyd said she feared the officers would kill them. “I still can't even process what happened,” Taniyah Pilgrim said at a news conference Monday. “We felt like we were going to die in that car.” Dramatic body-camera video released by police shows a group of officers shouting orders, smashing the driver’s side window, deploying stun guns and pulling Pilgrim and Messiah Young from the sedan. Throughout, the couple can be heard screaming and asking officers what is happening. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a news conference Sunday after reviewing body camera footage that she and police Chief Erika Shields decided to immediately fire two of the officers involved and place three others on desk duty pending investigation. “Use of excessive force is never acceptable,"" Bottoms told reporters. Shields called the footage “really shocking to watch.” Police identified the fired officers as Investigator Ivory Streeter, who was hired in December 2003, and Investigator Mark Gardner, hired in August 1997. Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said in a statement Monday that his office is in contact with Shields and is ""moving rapidly to reach an appropriate charging decision.” Young, 22, of Chicago, is a rising senior at Morehouse, where he's studying business management. Pilgrim, 20 — from San Antonio, Texas — is a psychology major at Spelman College. Both schools are historically black colleges near downtown Atlanta. Young suffered a fractured arm and required 20 stitches. He said the arrest was “one of the hardest things that I've ever experienced in my life.” The two were out getting something to eat Saturday night when they got snarled in traffic along Centennial Olympic Park in downtown Atlanta, their lawyers said. A friend of theirs, another Morehouse student, was standing in the street talking to them while they were stopped when police began to take him into custody, Young's lawyer Mawuli Davis said. Young used his phone to film what was happening and that's when officers turned on him, Davis said, adding he believes the officers' motivation was to keep his client from capturing what was going on. Police on Sunday released video from seven officers' body cameras. It shows the officers taking the other young man into custody as he pleads with them to let him go, saying he didn’t do anything. Young, behind the wheel of a car stopped in the street, is holding his phone up as an officer approaches and pulls his door open. Young pulls it shut and says repeatedly, “I’m not dying today.” He tells officers the other man is with them and urges them to release his friend and let him get in the car. The car advances and gets stuck in traffic as officers run up to both sides, shouting orders. An officer uses a stun gun on Pilgrim as she’s trying to get out, and officers pull her from the car. Another officer yells at Young to put the car in park and open the window. An officer repeatedly hits the driver’s side window with a baton, and another finally manages to break it. Officers also slashed the tires, the lawyers said. As the window glass shatters, an officer uses a stun gun on Young and officers pull him from the car as officers shout, “Get your hand out of your pockets,” and, “He got a gun. He got a gun. He got a gun.” Once he’s out and on the ground, officers zip tie his hands behind his back and lead him away. Police reports do not list a gun as having been recovered. Davis said Young has never been arrested and there was no gun or drugs in the car. “There is no justification, none whatsoever, for what they did to them and for what the system did to them,” Davis said, later adding, “If there was a gun, best believe this would have had a very different outcome.” In incident reports, Streeter wrote that he used his “electronic conductive weapon” on the driver and Gardner wrote that he deployed his Taser “to bring the female passenger under control.” Bottoms said Pilgrim was released without charges. She said Young was released, too, and she's ordering charges against him dropped. A police report says he was charged with attempting to elude police and driving with a suspended license. Davis said criminal defense attorney Gary Spencer is working pro bono to make sure Young's charges are dropped and to get the arrest wiped from his record so it doesn't cause him problems later in life. L. Chris Stewart, an attorney representing Pilgrim, said they intend to file a lawsuit, saying cities often don't make changes until they have to start writing checks. “We want change in policies, in procedures, in laws,” Stewart said. “It's not hard to fix.” Training records from the Peace Officer Standards and Training Council, which certifies law enforcement officers in Georgia, show that Streeter and Gardner recently completed training in use of force and in deescalation tactics.",0.0

Subscribe here. Demonstrations condemning police brutality and systemic racism continued throughout the weekend across the US. Images of peaceful marches, rioting, arrests of journalists and militarized police responding with tear gas and rubber bullets marked the protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last week. The protests encompassed the devastatingly long list of extrajudicial killings of black Americans and deep structural racism. Worldwide activists, in solidarity with United States protesters and addressing regional inequities, mobilized in the United Kingdom, Ethiopia, New Zealand, Brazil and elsewhere. Authoritarian governments in Iran, China, North Korea and Russia used the moment to undermine US criticism of their own history of entrenched human rights abuses. This moment is happening against the backdrop of a pandemic that has disproportionately affected minority populations. “COVID is another risk,” one infectious disease doctor said. “That doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t protest — it just means that we should take more precautions.” COVID-19: The latest from The World What The World is following China has seized on unrest in the US to goad President Donald Trump, even as it cracks down harshly on human rights activists in Hong Kong.

And if the coronavirus spreads, it has the potential to wipe out entire ethnic groups.

Prior to next week's event, separate memorial services in Minnesota and North Carolina will be held. Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will pay the expenses of all three events after the former boxing champion's offer of assistance was accepted by the family. It was another day of protests accross the country. Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled. Under heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House. Earlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure. The Hennepin County medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. A closer look at some recent developments: George Floyd's funeral will be held on June 9 in Houston, Texas. Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the Memorial Day confrontation was the right thing to do.

There will be a public viewing next Monday in Texas, Crump said. Crump added there will be two separate memorial services for Floyd. One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Protesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots Calling himself ""your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden. Before Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them. Trump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Family autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide An autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said. The family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene. “What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.” Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. ""The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. ""From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.'' The Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted ""fentanyl intoxication'' and ""recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd. Two Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest. President Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests. Floyd's brother calls for peaceful protests Wearing a mask that read ""We can't breathe'' on one half and ""Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner. Terrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive. ""My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. ""Let's do this another way.'' Floyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote. ""Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. ""Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.'' The crowd, which had earlier chanted, ""Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: ""One down, three to go.'' Though all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Trump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people' President Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” More than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Disturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters The sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic. It's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds. -- Ryan W. Miller Louisville police chief fired after another killing Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew. Police and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a ""large crowd"" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured. -- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal Protests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks Protests can be ""breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19. Focus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" Mina said. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Ken Alltucker and Karen Weintraub Chicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire' Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night. Chicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she ""did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn."" “The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,"" she said. Police chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says George Floyd's death was ""unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries ""that has included institutional racism"" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action ""within their legal authority"" to hold officers accountable. ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now,"" the statement said. ""We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised."" Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday. A weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people have been arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, including Secret Service agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7 p.m. curfew Monday. She said significant damage was done around the White House on Sunday. There was also a fire at the historic St. John's Church across from the White House. – Kevin Johnson In New York: Police cars burn, no curfew planned, mayor's daughter arrested Setting a curfew in New York City to help curb violent protests would be a pointless exercise doomed to failure, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday. Police cars burned and several officers were injured in clashes Sunday night, the fourth consecutive night of violence in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter Chiara was among almost 1,000 people arrested since Thursday, said NYPD officers ""showed restraint"" amid the mayhem. De Blasio also downplayed the value of a curfew. Shea, speaking on the ""Today"" show, said a curfew would be ignored and extremely difficult to enforce. “The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen,"" Shea said. ""And if people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on."" More news about the George Floyd protests Journalists attacked by officers, protesters As protests across the nation turn violent, members of the news media have been caught in the crossfire – or targeted. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. In Iowa on Sunday, police arrested reporter Andrea Sahouri of the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, on charges of failure to disperse while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said targeted attacks on journalists covering the demonstrations ""show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them."" – Lorenzo Reyes 3 dead in confrontations with authorities in Kentucky, Iowa Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear authorized state police to conduct an independent investigation after Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shot a man early Monday.

In Davenport, Iowa, two people were killed in multiple shootings after rioting broke out, the police chief said at a news conference Monday. Chief Paul Sikorski said police responded Sunday night to disturbances near a mall involving 100 vehicles and ""rioters."" Over the next several hours, police responded to dozens of confirmed shots-fired incidents, including one where officers were ambushed and one was shot, Sikorski said. One officer was shot, one officer returned fire and several rounds hit the officers' vehicle. ""They were not like they protests and demonstrations Saturday,"" Sikorski said. ""What we experienced tonight, last night was completely unacceptable and it does not honor the memory of Mr. Floyd."" – Philip Joens, Des Moines Register; Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night.

Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage.

The nationwide unrest following the death of George Floyd has again reminded many of the film. In an interview, he talks about the echoes of his film, what makes this moment different than protests before and his hopes for justice. (AP Photo/Peter Kramer, File) NEW YORK – It's not the first time that Spike Lee's “Do the Right Thing” has been freshly urgent, but Lee's 1989 film has again found blistering relevance in the wake of George Floyd's death. On Monday, Lee released a short film titled “3 Brothers"" connecting the death of Radio Raheem (played by Bill Nunn) in “Do the Right Thing” to the deaths of Floyd and Eric Garner. Floyd died last week after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck as he begged for air. Garner's dying plea of “I can't breathe” became a rallying cry against police brutality in 2014. Blazed across the screen is the question: “Will history stop repeating itself?"" “I've seen this before. This is not new,"" Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday. “I was born in '57 so I was 11 years old when I saw the riots with Dr. King's assassination, later on with Rodney King and the Simi Valley verdict, Trayvon Martin and Ferguson.” “People are tired and they take to the streets,” said Lee. “Do the Right Thing,” about rising racial tensions on a hot summer day in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, took direct inspiration from reality. In the film, Raheem is choked to death by a police officer, sparking a riot. Lee modeled the choke hold that kills Raheem on the murder of Michael Stewart, a graffiti artist who was killed by New York City police officers in 1983. Lee dedicated the film to Stewart’s family, as well as those of several other black people killed by police officers. “His death is not just made up. Many years later, Eric Garner, automatically I thought of Ray Raheem,"" said Lee. ""Then to see my brother George Floyd. I mean, he was quoting the words of Eric Garner: ‘I can’t breathe.’ He was channeling Eric Garner. I’m sure of it.” As much as Lee sees history repeating itself, there's one element of the current unrest that strikes the filmmaker as new. “I've been very encouraged by the diversity of the protesters. I haven't seen this diverse protests since when I was a kid,” Lee said, citing the movements of the '60s. “I'm encouraged that my white sisters and brothers are out there. ""That is the hope of this country, this diverse, younger generation of Americans who don't want to perpetuate the same (expletive) that their parents and grandparents and great-grandparents got caught up in. That's my hope.” To illustrate the point, Lee cited cities with smaller black populations, like Des Moines, Iowa, where protests and riots have occurred. “My young white sisters and brothers are out there in the streets. How many black folks are in Salt Lake City, Utah? And let's take into account that the NBA is not playing,"" said Lee, letting out an enormous cackle. ""The Utah Jazz are not playing!” “3 Brothers” is the second short Lee has released during the pandemic. While Lee has kept to his Upper East Side apartment with his family, he has also biked around the city to shoot. Lee's “New York, New York,” set to Frank Sinatra, was released in early May as an ode to his outbreak-stricken city. Next week, he'll release on Netflix “Da 5 Bloods,"" a Vietnam War drama about four black veterans who return to Vietnam to find the remains of their fallen squad leader (Chadwick Boseman). Lee has only modest hopes for justice in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Attorney General William Barr he calls “not a friend to justice.” “He's going to do what Agent Orange tell him to do,” said Lee, using his favored nickname for President Donald Trump. But Lee has been buoyed by a photo of New York police officers kneeling with protesters, an image he likened to Colin Kaepernick's NFL protests. “They need to show the image more,” said Lee. “Colin Kaepernick is a patriot.” ___ Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/JakeCoyleAP",0.0

(WAVY) — The Virginia Zoo is celebrating a giraffe calf who is yet to be named. The Masai giraffe calf born on May 26 weighs 146 pounds and stands about 6-feet-tall. The calf was born to mom, Noelle, and dad, Billy, whom zoo officials say are attentive parents. The calf is reportedly nursing well as he and his mother bond. This birth brings the herd total to five: Imara and Kylie, the Zoo’s two other female giraffes, Billy, Noelle and her new calf. Billy is also the father to Kylie, who just celebrated her first birthday last month. Masai giraffes are currently listed as endangered due to habitat loss and poaching, so the birth of this newest calf is especially important. To help support the Zoo’s operations, it is asking everyone to help name the baby giraffe. In an extra fun naming contest, anyone can submit a name suggestion for just $5.  The names will then be narrowed down to five options by Zoo staff and Billy, the calf’s father, will choose the final name!  How will a giraffe pick the name? The Zoo will reveal this during a Virtual Voyage on June 9. Name entries will be accepted from today, June 1 to June 7, 2020, via the Zoo’s website at virginiazoo.org/giraffenaming. The top five names will be announced on June 8. Proceeds from the auction will benefit the Zoo’s Emergency Operating Fund.

(WAVY) — Tensions flared at the Virginia Beach Oceanfront on Sunday night during a mostly peaceful protest over the death of George Floyd, who died last Monday at the hands of Minneapolis police after an officer put his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes. It was one of several protests this past weekend in Hampton Roads, but the only one in which things really escalated.

People of all shades united and marched for more than two dozen blocks. But around 10 p.m. things started to heat up. In a press conference on Monday afternoon, Acting Police Chief Tony Zucaro says some members of the crowd starting throwing projectiles at officers and breaking windows of storefronts. Protesters shut down bridge at Rudee Inlet…surrounded @VBPD police cruisers and started throwing water bottles when police started to move in @WAVY_News pic.twitter.com/LwJW07J8Y5 — Brett Hall (@BrettHNews) June 1, 2020 Protesters at one point surrounded a police car around 10 p.m., a video that Zucaro focused on for about 3 minutes during the briefing. The crowd surrounds the vehicle, but doesn’t appear cause any damage. Five police vehicles however did sustain damage, including broken windshields. Zucaro says a cinder block was also thrown at one officer’s head, one of two officers that received injuries, Zucaro said. Both had “minor” injuries, and the officer hit in the head returned to the police operations center after going to the emergency room. In Monday’s press conference, Zucaro claimed that the “surging” crowd of protesters deployed tear gas of their own before police deployed gas, but didn’t show visual evidence. Video did show police using tear gas multiple times, but not protesters. Zucaro also acknowledged video that shows the driver of a red truck with American flags speeding down the street toward the crowd. The driver narrowly missed one protester, and eventually stopped in front of another who was in the road, but kept going as other protesters hit the truck. The person who was in the road briefly got out of the way, but jumped back in front of the truck, which continued to roll forward. The truck eventually sped off. Zucaro called the video of the truck “troubling” and said his detectives are still looking for the truck, but so far haven’t been able to track it down. He’s asking for the public’s help in identifying the driver. Meanwhile several business were also damaged and broken into, but none sustained significant damage Zucaro said. WAVY’s Tamara Scott took the video below before 10:30 p.m. 48 businesses in total ended up being vandalized, Erin Sutton, Virginia Beach’s director of emergency management said.

Police launched multiple canisters of tear gas while a large police vehicle made its way down Atlantic Avenue. Zucaro says the gas was “effective and to a degree helped dissipate those numbers [of protesters] in that immediate vicinity.” Some protesters remained past midnight, with police eventually reporting “no further acts of disturbance” at 3 a.m. “Go home, go to your room or go to jail,” @VBPD shout as some protesters try to help clean up. @WAVY_News pic.twitter.com/GbHeoc86xX — Brett Hall (@BrettHNews) June 1, 2020 Zucaro says 19 people in total were arrested on 28 charges, two on felony charges that included assault on a law enforcement officer, 16 on misdemeanors and 1 for a traffic violation. He says four of those arrested were from Virginia Beach, with nine from other parts of Hampton Roads. Four were from Virginia, but outside Hampton Roads, and two were from out of state. He said just over 50% were African American and 40% were white. On Monday afternoon, several Oceanfront businesses were still cleaning up from the damage, which totaled $317,000, Sutton said. That figure doesn’t include merchandise that may have been taken. Several businesses had just recently reopened after being closed due to the coronavirus. “My heart goes out to all the business owners that suffered the damage, we’re already in tough economic tough with the financial stress from the pandemic, but let me just say people have the right to protest,” Virginia Beach Mayor Bobby Dyer said Monday morning. “We hear you,” Dyer said to protesters, “peaceful protest is a tremendous message and a right for every American, but when we start resorting to violence, and other peoples’ property destruction, that’s where we’ve got to draw the line.” Zucaro says all municipal parking lots in the resort area will close at 6 p.m. Monday, and there will be restricted access throughout the resort area, with barricades in place. All on-street parking on Atlantic Avenue will be closed. Around 4:30 p.m. Virginia Beach Police said they have received information that National Guard troops will be in the city starting Monday evening. Dyer said earlier in the day he was impressed by the “restraint” and “professionalism” displayed by police on Sunday night. Zucaro said his force handled the situation “admirably.” This AM: Business owners at the #VirginiaBeach Oceanfront are out cleaning up the damage following the protest.  “The protest started out so beautiful, all shades were out marching.

Protest broke out across the nation this past weekend in response to the death of George Floyd. Floyd died last Monday in Minneapolis after a police officer put his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than 8 minutes. The officer, Derrick Chauvin, was arrested on Friday and charged with third-degree murder. Floyd was black and Chauvin is white. Most of this weekend’s protests were peaceful, however, some turned violent, prompting governors of multiple states to activate the National Guard. Protesters were seen looting, rioting and clashing with police. Dr. Bernice King spoke out during an Atlanta city briefing on Saturday, asking for nonviolence. “As I stand here in this moment and look at my journey, I have to make an appeal to my brothers and sisters, because I realized that the only way to get constructive change is through nonviolent means,” she said. She continued to say that many people have been using her father’s words “riots are the language of the unheard.” Nonviolence is not weak or passive. Nonviolence is active and aggressive. It is strategic, with an ultimate goal. It seeks true peace, which = justice. Even if you disagree with it as a method for social change, I still hear you and love you. You are an answer and a solution. pic.twitter.com/COkjEJXOL2 — Be A King (@BerniceKing) May 30, 2020 However, she continued to say the only way to overcome systemic racism and white supremacy in America is through nonviolent means. “It is a proven method,” King said. “It did not fail my father… it did not fail them. Because when you really understand it and really practice it, it brings about the results.” She acknowledges that African Americans want change and they want it now, but reiterates violence is not the solution. “Change never comes through violence. It is not a solution. Violence, in fact, creates more problems,” she explained. King says that those acting violently are not honoring the legacy of her father or that of George Floyd. Instead, they must fight for justice peacefully as nonviolence seeks true peace. Continuing coverage, here.",0.0

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday derided many governors as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations in the aftermath of another night of violent protests in dozens of American cities. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference that also included law enforcement and national security officials, telling the state leaders they “have to get much tougher.” “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” The days of protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes. The demonstrations turned violent in several cities, with looting and mayhem, and fires ignited in historic park Lafayette Park across from the White House. The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced a spasm of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again,” said Trump. “We’re doing it in Washington, D.C. We’re going to do something that people haven’t seen before.” The president told the governors they were making themselves “look like fools” for not calling up more of the National Guard as a show for force on city streets. Attorney General Bill Barr, who was also on the call, told governors that a joint terrorist task force would be used to track agitators and urged local officials to “dominate” the streets and control, not react to crowds, and urged them to “go after troublemakers.” Trump’s angry exhortations at the nation’s governors came after a night of escalating violence, images of fires and looting and clashes with police filling the nation’s airwaves and overshadowing the largely peaceful protests. The protests grew so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground bunker previously used during terrorist attacks. On Monday, Trump also spoke of trying to criminalize flag-burning. The Supreme Court has conservative new members since it last ruled on that issue, and Trump said that “I think it’s time to review that again.” He continued his effort to project strength, using a series of inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks during a time of national crisis. As cities burned night after night and images of violence dominated television coverage, Trump’s advisers discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president’s own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity. Trump did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to on Monday either. The demonstrations in Washington appeared to catch officers by surprise. They sparked one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Secret Service protocol would call for all those under the agency’s protection to be in the underground shelter. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service. Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening. Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force. “This isn’t going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,” Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president. In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. The Justice Department deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. LATEST HEADLINES:",0.0

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

1622569169,2020-06-01 10:45:04,FCPD Police Chief on Floyd’s Death: ‘Righteous Anger Needs to be Constructively Exercised’,https://www.restonnow.com/2020/06/01/fcpd-police-chief-on-floyds-death-righteous-anger-needs-to-be-constructively-exercised/,en,False,,144573,restonnow.com,http://restonnow.com/,"As the sixth day of protests following George Floyd’s death at hands of a Minneapolis police officer continue, local law enforcement officials say they have faith the justice system will produce a just outcome for Floyd and his family. Peaceful protests were marred by violence over the weekend — including looting and fires in the District last night. Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin was arrested and fired after a viral video shows the officer holding his knee to Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day. Three other officers involved in the incident were also fired. The incident prompted Fairfax County Police Department Police Chief Edwin Roessler Jr. to reflect on ongoing challenges that erode the public’s trust in law enforcement. “We shall have faith the local and federal justice systems will navigate toward justice for the Floyd family, the communities impacted, and our entire nation. However, we must be mindful there is a healing process where righteous anger needs to be constructively exercised through the right to free speech,” Roessler Jr. wrote. Roessler noted that FCPD’s community policing efforts and collaborations with the community have helped the department operate in a transparent and accountable manner. “Fairfax County is blessed to have a highly engaged community which helps our Police Department transparently use a co-production of policing philosophy to ensure our hiring processes, training, policies, and internal and external accountability systems are meeting the expectations of the highest levels of standards by our community served and the law enforcement profession,” he said. Here’s more from the chief on FCPD’s community engagement efforts: During the last few trying days and today, I’ve personally networked with our community advocates to ensure they have access to their Chief and the senior law enforcement leaders of the Department to create robust dialogue to understand the awful events that have unfolded recently throughout our country as we need to increase our conversations about the erosion of the public’s trust for law enforcement as we continue to observe the disproportionately of the deaths of our African American community members. As a reminder, we have updated our use of force policies over the years using the co-production of policing model, vetted our policies and training through the Public Safety Committee, and we continue to leverage the partnerships created with community members who were part of the Ad Hoc Police Practices Review Commission. Additionally, we are grateful for the external accountability measures from the Police Civilian Review Panel, the Independent Police Auditor, the voluntary submission to both state and national accreditation agencies, and the periodic independent reviews of our lines of business by academic institutions. “We continue to pray for Mr. Floyd’s family as individuals, a Police Department, and as a community who all collectively value the sanctity of all human life,” he added. Herndon Police Department’s Police Chief Maggie DeBoard also said she hopes the community will continue to trust HPD. “It is only through honest and open dialogue, clear minds, and peaceful protest can we continue to make positive steps forward to ensure an incident of this nature never happens again,” DeBoard wrote in a statement yesterday (Sunday). DeBoard said the actions that took the life of Floyd “showed a complete lack of humanity, one not previously witnessed in my 34-year career.” The incident has left police officers “deeply struggling about our profession,” she said. Here’s more from DeBoard’s note to the community: These communities need hope, not destruction, more loss of life, and loss of their livelihoods. This is not the path towards healing or problem solving. It only creates additional barriers and fear at a time when peace and clear minds are so needed. Please know that all of us at HPD care deeply about our entire community, as well as the effect this incident has had on your relationship with us. We pray that the trust you have instilled in us over the past 8 years that I have been blessed to serve as your Chief, remains strong. It is only through honest and open dialogue, clear minds, and peaceful protest can we continue to make positive steps forward to ensure an incident of this nature never happens again. Our hearts and prayers go out to George Floyd’s family and to all of those first responders working the front lines trying desperately to protect their communities and its citizens from further harm.

A new community group, Citizens for a Better Leesburg, is planning a peaceful walk through the Town Green in front of Leesburg Town Hall from 3-5 p.m. this afternoon. The walk is in response to the death of George Floyd, an African American man who was killed while in police custody last week. Floyd’s death has set off massive protests throughout the U.S., with many cities over the weekend being placed into lockdown due to the unrest. Participants are asked to wear a face mask, practice social distancing, and bring any signs they want. Those who come out to the walk are asked to disperse after they walk through the Town Green, but can leave signs behind in a designated area and sign a posterboard to show support. There will be no speakers or formal program. For more information, go to facebook.com/events/1363833620672634. krodriguez@loudounnow.com",0.0

What was originally planned as a quiet, socially-distant walk through the town green turned instead into one of the biggest demonstrations Leesburg has ever seen, with a line of marchers circling King Street, Loudoun Street, Church Street and back up Edwards Ferry Road. The line was so long, chanting marchers caught up to the rear of the march as they walked back up Edwards Ferry Road. There they turned to pack the courthouse lawn, spilling onto the surrounding streets. And what had been planned as an event without any speeches instead brought speeches from the steps of the courthouse by the Loudoun NAACP President Michelle Thomas, county Chairwoman Phyllis J. Randall (D-At Large), Rep. Jennifer T. Wexton (D-VA-10), and Leesburg Town Council member Ron Campbell, whose new group “Citizen for a Better Leesburg” first planned the event. “If your presence means anything, it’s no more rhetoric about what we need to do,” Campbell said. “We know the changes. We’ve been fighting for them long enough. We either need to have the courage to do what we say we’re going to do, or move those aside who don’t.” The protest came in the wake of the latest series of high-profile police killings of black people including Breonna Taylor in Lousville, KY, and most recently George Floyd in Minneapolis, MN. It was named after some of Floyd’s last words, as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck, and the phrase “I can’t breathe” became rallying cry for protesters again. The phrase was also prominent in previous protests following the death of another black man, Eric Garner, who said the same thing shortly before he died after being arrested in New York City. It was also a fervent but peaceful reflection of the protests that have gripped communities across the nation, leading in some cases to riots and violent clashes with police. “There’s one thing I know for sure: George Floyd was a tipping point, he was a tipping point, but there were so many that came before,” Randall said. She and Thomas also urged protesters to take their energy to the ballot box in November. “Chanting, speaking, is the easy part,” Thomas said. “The harder part comes in the weeks to come, when it’s time to vote up.” Ali, one protester, said he was brought to the protest by “a sense of being.” “This is definitely a time when we need to stand together,” Ali said. “When I say that, I mean everyone, everyone of all colors. We have to show that what’s going on is unacceptable as a society to everyone, that we notice it, we acknowledge it and we have a problem with it.” He said he will continue to find other rallies and protests, and said others should join. “It’s not enough to say you support from your couch, or from your Instagram or your Twitter, it’s not enough,” he said. “This is important. Being out here is important, because the people who don’t agree with what we’re doing, people who aren’t supporting, are disturbed by our presence right now, and that’s the point.” Other attendees said their next step will be to cast their votes. “We need to start voting in ways that can make a difference,” said Abby, another protester. “…Everyone can come together and support a cause.” “What we want you to do is to stay engaged,” Thomas said. “What we want you to do is to find somebody that does not look like you, that does not speak like you, and does not always think like you and make a neighbor, make a friend, make an ally. This issue is an American issue, not just a black issue.”",0.0

Ibraheem S. Samirah (D-86) issued a statement today criticizing the actions of law enforcement officers during Sunday night’s protests in Washington, DC, where he said he was among the demonstrators who suffered from the use of tear gas. The Herndon dentist, whose House district includes a portion of Sterling in Loudoun County, said he joined the protestors to demand justice for George Floyd and an end to racist police violence and brutality. “I, like many others over the past week, was engaging in peaceful, democratic protest when the police forces who were present escalated the situation. There was a curfew set by Mayor Bowser that was supposed to begin at 11pm. But before that time even came, tear gas and rubber bullets were deployed on the crowd, including myself, and the police moved in on us,” he stated. Samirah posted several videos on his twitter page, including one of protesters pushing back barriers that had been set up by police around the protest area and another of protesters throwing items on a fire in a downtown street. Two others show Samirah talking into his camera after being exposed to the tear gas. I represent the DC area in the Virginia House of Delegates. Last night, the police tear gassed me anyway. (1/5) pic.twitter.com/dc4B2JXHLm — Delegate Ibraheem Samirah (@IbraheemSamirah) June 1, 2020 “I represent the DC area in the Virginia House of Delegates. Last night, the police tear gassed me anyway,” he wrote on the video post. “When I was able to identify myself as an elected official, police momentarily backed off. But that’s a privilege that millions of other black folks like me don’t have in the US. It’s a privilege that George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others didn’t have,” Samirah said in a press release about the incident. The delegate also criticized President Donald J. Trump. “While Americans join together in a historic display of solidarity and compassion, Donald Trump continues to hide behind his racism and encourage law enforcement to threaten, attack and brutalize peaceful demonstrators like me,” he wrote in the press release. “Somehow in the year since the President and I​last met in Jamestown​, his bigotry has gotten even more reprehensible. There’s no question that the President watched with cowardice from the other side of the White House lawn while the pain of our nation was made worse by overzealous police.” “It should be clear to all that there are deep and systemic issues with racism, brutality, and corruption in our police departments. Until we take a courageous stand for real, tangible change, justice will not be achieved. That’s why I am joining the growing nationwide movement that is calling for the demilitarization of our police and a redirection of funds from police departments to the services folks need now more than ever, like housing, healthcare, education, transportation, and true public safety,” he wrote.“These are certainly unprecedented times and I encourage everyone to keep their protest safe and righteous. As an elected official and member of my community, I make it my duty to continue this struggle until ALL of my constituents can finally feel safe in their own neighborhoods. No justice, no peace.”",0.0

For 8 mins and 46 seconds, Americawitnessed the murder of George Floyd.I extend my most sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of George Floyd. And to every African American person who fears that George Floyd could be them, their son, their father, their brother, their friend, I am sorry. Yesterday was another challenging day for our nation and our communities.For me, my day started with a prayer.I needed to shore up my faith because it was severally challenged. With prayer, came tears.However, the tears could not wash away what I saw on May 25 and many times thereafter.Then came the screams. The need to yell away the pain and heartache was strong – but I was not successful. Believe you me, I tried. So, my anger intensified. So, I did what many of us are doing, I looked for action. I need action. Without action, I feel powerless.Without action, I feel broken. Without action, I feel defeated. I need action. So, I found action.I went into Leesburg and participated in the “I Can’t Breathe – Silent Walk.”I walked and talked alongside over 1,000 Loudouners in unity.And, it felt great. And, my spirit was awakened.I became stronger.I was ready for further action. So, I decided on and come to you with action – I come to you with a challenge.I need you to join me and “VoiceUP!”I promise you that I will “VoiceUP!” That means that I will step up and speak up when I see an injustice. Be that injustice in the Courts, in the grocery store, at the gas station, in the streets, in a restaurant, in a park, or anywhere that I am. And, I want you to “VoiceUP!” I need you to “VoiceUP!” in the board room, at the daycare center, in the schools, at your job, in your community – everywhere you are, “VoiceUP!” when you see an injustice. We need to stand up for all members of our community and at all times. Not just after a tragedy. When we “VoiceUP!”, each of us has the opportunity to protect and raise up our neighbors. George Floyd is dead because not one of the four former Minneapolis police officers chose to “VoiceUP!” Not one of them said “stop,” “no” or “enough.” I truly believe that if just one of them chose to “VoiceUP!”, George Floyd would still be on this earth and his children would still have a father in their lives. Since that fateful day, our community has fallen into an abyss I can only call grief. We have grieved over the senseless killings of Trevon Martin, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Laquan McDonald, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Philando Castillo, Antwon Rose, Jr., Ahmoud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and now George Floyd.And only God knows how many others that were not exposed and video-taped for us to know their names. And, each day we continue grieving because many of us feel powerless, helpless and hopeless. I am reaching out to you to say “VoiceUP!” When I was struggling for action, I was confronted by the fear that our community would succumb to its grief, anger, and rage.That the destruction that we are seeing nationwide would infiltrate our community and break us further.I am proud to say, we are Loudoun!We will not hurt, destroy or injure one another!Yes, we will “VoiceUP!” We will work together to have conversations that may be extremely uncomfortable, troubling and hurtful. But, we will work towards a more unified and just community.We have the opportunity and responsibility to “VoiceUP!”By embracing our voices, we will see each other with new eyes.We have to see each other as brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, and mothers and fathers.We have to come together with warmth, humility and mostly, humanity so we can develop unity and address the problem – because it is OUR problem.And, we can do it – we are Loudoun!As has been said before “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.”I choose to stand with Loudoun. Since May 25, many of us have experienced a roller coaster of emotions – our emotions include shock, anger, fear, rage and frustration.Today, I say to each and every person in Loudoun County and beyond, to include the entire United States “VoiceUP!”Yesterday, at 3 p.m. our community engaged in a Silent Walk in memory of the murder of George Floyd.We walked together in peace and unity through the streets of Leesburg and onto the Courthouse lawn and gathered in front of the courthouse steps and we revived hope.Let’s keep walking towards solutions for our community. As the world witnessed the pseudo lynching of George Floyd by four men who murdered him all the while dishonoring their uniforms and the positions of trust and respect that they were granted, we felt shock – how is this happening yet again! And we watched as they allowed Chauvin to place and keep his knee on George Floyd’s neck for 8 mins and 46 seconds. They failed to act and save George Floyd’s life.Even after they checked George Floyd’s pulse and determined there was none, they allowed Chauvin to keep his knee on George Floyd’s neck for another 173 seconds. They failed George Floyd. They failed the people of Minneapolis.And, they failed all of us. I pray and hope that Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng – the four former Minneapolis Police Officers who murdered George Floyd while the world watched, are charged, prosecuted, convicted and punished.But, that is not enough – it is time for us to “VoiceUP!” Anyone who embraces destruction under the cover of protest only serves to muffle our voices.We will “VoiceUP!” and not tolerate it.We will not engage in the destruction that we see elsewhere because that defeats us in our purpose which is to condemn the murder of George Floyd.We will not destroy businesses as most are barely surviving due to COVID-19 because that only harms our community and detracts from our condemnation of the murder of George Floyd.We will not engage in violence that endangers lives because that only harms our community and takes the focus away from the murder of George Floyd.So, Loudoun “VoiceUP!” To every law enforcement officer who condemns the actions of Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, and recognizes them to be the criminals that they are – we thank you and will continue to respect and protect you.For any law enforcement officer serving in Loudoun County who does not have a problem with the actions of those cowards, surrender your badge, you have no place here in our community.And, I commit to assist every head of each law enforcement agency to get rid of you immediately.We will treat you like the criminal you choose to become if you dishonor the uniform and badge and violate our trust.We will not let you place our community and the honest police officers in jeopardy because of your ill will.You will have no place here in our community. So now, I say to you – each and every one of you. “VoiceUP!” Regardless of the color of our skin, the country of our birth, the language of our voices, the level of our education, the jobs that we have, the money in our bank accounts, the circles that we run in – “VoiceUP!” To Loudoun County Sheriff Chapman “VoiceUP!” To Leesburg Police Chief Brown “VoiceUP!” To Purcellville Police Chief McAlister “VoiceUP!” To Middleburg Police Chief Panebianco “VoiceUP!” To all of my partners in Justice and our community law enforcement leaders in America: “VoiceUP!” To our elected Board of Supervisors: “VoiceUP!” To our elected School Board Members: “VoiceUP!” To Every Elected Official across our County: “VoiceUP!” To Every School Board Administrator: “VoiceUP!” To Every Teacher in our Loudoun classrooms: “VoiceUP!” To Every Coach and Mentor: “VoiceUP!” To every Loudoun County Employee: “VoiceUP!” To Our Judges who have the power and responsibility to end the systemic injustices that make up our criminal justice system: “VoiceUP!” To all of Our Business Partners: “VoiceUP!” To All ofOur Institutions of Higher Learning; “VoiceUP!” To Every Loudoun County Resident: “VoiceUP!” To Every Parent, Grandparent, Aunt and Uncle, Neighbor, Friend,Co-worker Colleague: “VoiceUP!” Have the conversations that share the experiences and heart of one another.When you hear racist words, “VoiceUP!.” When you see racist acts, “VoiceUP!” When you have the opportunity to teach humanity, “VoiceUP!” We are Loudoun and we will “VoiceUP!”If we continue to be silent, we are no different than the 3 former police officers who did nothing, said nothing and destroyed everything that was George Floyd.What do you want to stand for – Loudoun? “VoiceUp!” Yesterday was a day of revival – we saw that we all have hope.Today is a day of empowerment – we can all “VoiceUP!” Today and every day hereafter is a day of action.I am seeking your thoughts and ideas on how we can better serve our community.What do you think we need to and can do to ensure that there is never a Derek Chauvin in our midst? That there is never a Derek Chauvin wearing our police uniforms? How can we better support our community – to include our African American families – to give them safety and security? To ensure them that when they wake up in the morning, they don’t need to worry whether they will come home alive in the evening? So that no Loudouner has to suffer like the family and friends of George Floyd.",0.0

(Photo by JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON (AP) — A country convulsed by violent protests picked up the pieces Monday morning and braced for more trouble amid a coast-to-coast outpouring of rage over police killings of black people. President Donald Trump demanded the nation’s governors crack down harder on the violence, telling them: “Most of you are weak.” After six straight days of unrest, a new routine was developing: residents waking up to neighborhoods in shambles, shopkeepers sweeping up broken glass and taking stock of ransacked stores, and police and political leaders weighing how to address the boiling anger. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was considering imposing a curfew on the nation’s biggest city after a night in which groups of people broke into Chanel, Prada and Rolex boutiques and electronics stores. At the same time, the mayor said the trouble in the city of 8.6 million people was being “fomented by a very small number of violent protesters. That is not what everyday community people are doing. I want to be very clear about that.” While many of the demonstrations around the country have been peaceful protests by racially diverse crowds, others have descended into violence, despite curfews in many cities across the U.S. and the deployment of thousands of National Guard soldiers over the past week. On Sunday, protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas or pepper spray in Austin, Texas, Atlanta and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them first, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis. The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes. Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Breonna Taylor to death in her home in March. Even as police in some places tried to calm tensions by kneeling or marching in solidarity with protesters, officers elsewhere were accused of the very type of harsh treatment at the heart of the unrest. In New York, the police commissioner said about six incidents were being investigated by the department’s internal affairs bureau, including a weekend confrontation in Brooklyn in which two police vehicles appeared to plow through a group of protesters. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an officer was suspended for pushing a kneeling woman to the ground during a protest. In Atlanta, two officers were fired after bashing in the window of a car and using a stun gun on its two occupants. In Los Angeles over the weekend, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The upheaval has unfolded amid the gloom and economic ruin caused by the coronavirus, which has killed over 100,000 Americans and sent unemployment soaring to levels not seen since the Depression. The outbreak has hit minorities especially hard, not just in infections and deaths but in job losses and economic stress. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests has rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count compiled by The Associated Press. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name!” At the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, police fired tear gas and stun grenades Sunday into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. A building in the park was burned down. The district’s entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to Pentagon officials. Trump, in a video teleconference Monday with the nation’s governors and law enforcement authorities, said local leaders “have to get much tougher.” “Most of you are weak,” he said. “You have to arrest people.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, wrote a post online expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. On Monday, he met with community leaders at a predominantly African American church in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” said Sylvester Beaman, pastor of the Bethel AME church. In Minneapolis, the officer who pinned Floyd to the pavement has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. Thousands marching on a closed Minneapolis freeway Sunday were shaken when a tractor-trailer rolled into their midst. No serious injuries were reported. The driver was arrested on suspicion of assault.",0.0

Or Participate In It',https://www.wmra.org/post/former-president-obama-lets-not-excuse-violence-or-participate-it,en,False,,144825,wmra.org,http://wmra.org/,"Former President Barack Obama said the protests in cities across the nation in the aftermath of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis under a police officer's knee ""represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system in the United States."" But he wrote in a post Monday on Medium that the ""the small minority of folks who've resorted to violence"" at many demonstrations are ""putting innocent people at risk, compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause."" He recounted seeing an interview, where he said, ""I saw an elderly black woman being interviewed today in tears because the only grocery store in her neighborhood had been trashed. If history is any guide, that store may take years to come back. So let's not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."" The country's first African American president weighed in after the nation experienced a sixth night of protests — which in some cities turned violent — following the death of Floyd, a black man, after being kneeled on by at least one Minneapolis officer, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The Democrat, who often admonishes people to vote, said that ""we should be fighting to make sure that we have a president, a Congress, a U.S. Justice Department, and a federal judiciary that actually recognize the ongoing, corrosive role that racism plays in our society and want to do something about it."" But he wrote that the officials ""who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system"" work at the state and local levels. Mayors and county executives, Obama wrote, appoint police chiefs and negotiate with police unions, while district attorneys and state's attorneys ""decide whether or not to investigate and ultimately charge those involved in police misconduct."" All are elected positions, Obama said, which usually suffer from ""pitifully low"" voter turnout, ""especially among young people — which makes no sense given the direct impact these offices have on social justice issues, not to mention the fact that who wins and who loses those seats is often determined by just a few thousand, or even a few hundred, votes."" Obama established a task force on ""21st-century policing"" in 2014 after Michael Brown's shooting death by police in Ferguson Mo., which led to violence there. Many police and criminal justice reforms outlined by Obama and his Justice Department have been abandoned during the Trump administration. President Trump has called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" and urged state and local governments to take aggressive action to quell any violent unrest. ",0.0

On April 29, 1992, thousands in the city's largely minority south side took to the streets after an all-white jury acquitted four white police officers of attacking King, a black driver, after a traffic stop. The outcome outraged a community that watched video of King being beaten with police batons, shot with stun guns and stomped on. By the time order was restored, rioting had spread across much of LA for five days, leaving more than 60 people dead, over 2,300 injured and $1 billion in property damage. Smoke enveloped the city after hundreds of buildings burned to the ground. The losses are far higher than in protests over Floyd's killing that have swept the nation for days, devolving into people setting buildings and police cars on fire, smashing their way into stores and hurling rocks and bottles at officers. Police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and thousands of arrests, many of them in LA. Kerman Maddox was a young radio reporter who lived just a block from one of the flashpoints in the 1992 riots. 'I had a chance to see a lot and observe a lot, and I was hoping I would never see that again,' said Maddox, who is black. But he also thought he'd never see another video recorded by a bystander as violent as the one of King's beating, Maddox said. Not until he watched footage of white Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin pressing a knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. 'I still have a hard time seeing that,"" said Maddox, who's a public affairs consultant. He said the chaotic protests it triggered did not entirely surprise him, soon after white men were arrested in May in the February killing of black Georgia jogger Ahmaud Arbery and other incidents. 'The problem is this is 2020, Rodney King happened almost 30 years ago and a lot of people see this stuff is still going on,"" Maddox said. ""You're upset, and you're angry, and you're perplexed because you're trying to figure out what do we have to do for this to end.' To see Los Angeles erupt in chaos for the second time in her life has been devastating, says Aurea Montes-Rodriguez, executive vice president of the Community Coalition South Los Angeles. As a high school student, she had to walk past burning buildings and looters after her school abruptly suspended bus service during the 1992 riots. The experience inspired her to dedicate her career to public service after earning a master's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles. 'I felt that what I was seeing on TV the first night and when I walked through the fires the second day was a civil unrest by people who were fed up believing that the legal system, that the justice system, was going to work for our community,' she said on the 25th anniversary of the King riots in 2017. That's still the problem, she said Sunday, not only in Los Angeles but in other U.S. cities. 'I'm deeply concerned and heartbroken that this is happening in our city, and worse, that it's happening in different parts of the country because our elected officials refuse to hear or see the devastation that families are hearing and experiencing,' Montes-Rodriguez said. Civil rights scholar Jody Armour has noticed that people of color now protesting are often joined by white people, something he didn't see during the 1992 uprising. That could be an indication, he says, that more white people, realizing black people were not exaggerating when they spoke of the dangers of driving or walking while black, have begun to develop an empathy and to stand with African Americans against oppression. 'Racial discrimination today isn't the old KKK racism, but racism of indifference,' says Armour, a black University of Southern California professor who has written and lectured on racial justice, criminal justice and the rule of law. 'You're not motivated by racial animus or spite, you just don't feel the pain of the out-group members as you do for your in-group members."" Still, he cautioned real change has never been easy and is often violent, from the Civil War to the 1960s civil rights movement. That it has taken this long to get to that point is especially frustrating to Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn, who was 13 when the Watts riots erupted near her home in 1965 after white officers got into a scuffle with a drunken driving suspect in the city's racially segregated Watts neighborhood. More than 30 people were killed. While there were substantial efforts to rebuild communities after both uprisings, she said Sunday that it's clear that ""despite what we have done, what has still not changed is the systemic racism that we're seeing across the country as it relates to the interaction between law enforcement and unarmed black men.' She said she's encouraged that several police chiefs have spoken out against Floyd's death. In New Jersey, for instance, Camden County Police Chief Joe Wysocki joined protesters in a march. 'I think that's where it has to start, we have to reform throughout this country our police departments,"" said Hahn, who is white and whose late father, Kenneth Hahn, was a revered figure in the largely black community he represented on the county Board of Supervisors for 40 years. 'I'm 68 years old,"" she said ruefully. ""My hope is to see in my lifetime a real change. So that I don't go through one of these again.'",0.0

(AP) "" Facebook employees are using Twitter and Facebook's internal communications tools to register their frustration over CEO Mark Zuckerberg's decision to leave up posts by President Donald Trump that suggested protesters in Minneapolis could be shot. Twitter flagged and demoted Trump's tweet about the protests when he used the phrase 'when the looting starts the shooting starts.' Facebook has let it stand, and Zuckerberg explained his reasoning in a Facebook post Friday. 'I know many people are upset that we've left the President's posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,' Zuckerberg wrote. Angry demonstrations have spread across the U.S. over the past week, creating some of the most widespread racial unrest since the 1960s. The protests, which have been met by violent police action in many cities, were spurred by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned to the pavement by an officer who put his knee on the handcuffed man's neck until he stopped breathing. Trump's comment evoked the civil-rights era by borrowing a phrase used in 1967 by Miami's police chief to warn of an aggressive police response to unrest in black neighborhoods. On Monday, dozens of Facebook employees staged a virtual 'walkout' to protest the company's decision not to touch the Trump posts according to a report in the New York Times, which cited anonymous senior employees at Facebook. The Times report says dozens of Facebook workers 'took the day off by logging into Facebook's systems and requesting time off to support protesters across the country."" Workers also expressed frustration in other ways, including posting on Twitter, speaking to managers and writing on Facebook's internal communication network. Though virtual, this was the first time that Facebook workers have staged a walkout in the company's history. Employees at the social media giant have been less outspoken than their counterparts at other tech companies such as Google and Twitter. 'I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we're showing up. The majority of coworkers I've spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard,' tweeted Jason Toff, a director of product management at Facebook who's been at the company for a year. Toff, who has a verified Twitter account, had 131,400 'likes' and thousands of retweets of his comment. He did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Monday. 'I don't know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable. I'm a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark's decision to do nothing about Trump's recent posts, which clearly incite violence. I'm not alone inside of FB. There isn't a neutral position on racism,' Facebook design manager Jason Stirman tweeted. Stirman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Sara Zhang, a product designer at the company, tweeted that Facebook's 'decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe. The policy pigeon holes us into addressing harmful user-facing content in two ways: keep content up or take it down.' 'I believe that this is a self-imposed constraint and implore leadership to revisit the solution,' she continued. Zhang declined to comment to The Associated Press. 'We recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community. We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership. As we face additional difficult decisions around content ahead, we'll continue seeking their honest feedback,' Facebook spokeswoman Liz Bourgeois said in a statement Monday. Facebook moved a weekly employee question and answer session with executives to Tuesday from this coming Thursday to respond to workers' concerns. Late Sunday, Zuckerberg again posted on Facebook, pledging a $10 million donation to racial justice groups. But he made no mention of Trump's posts. Instead, he highlighted Facebook's role in the spreading of the video of Floyd's death. 'We need to know George Floyd's name. But it's clear Facebook also has more work to do to keep people safe and ensure our systems don't amplify bias,' Zuckerberg wrote. Twitter has historically taken stronger stances than its larger rival, including a complete ban on political advertisements that Twitter announced last November. That's partly because Facebook, a much larger company with a broader audience,targeted by regulators over its size and power, has more to lose. And partly because the companies' CEOs don't always see eye to eye on their role in society. Over the weekend, Twitter changed the background and logo of its main Twitter account to black from its usual blue in support of the Black Lives Matter protesters and added a #blacklivesmatter hashtag. Facebook did the same with its own logo on its site, though without the hashtag.",0.0
1622594928,2020-06-01 15:48:36.774888,Family autopsy: Floyd asphyxiated by sustained pressure,https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Family-autopsy-Floyd-asphyxiated-by-sustained-pressure-570929471.html,en,True,,80667,whsv.com,http://www.whsv.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A medical examiner on Monday classified George Floyd’s death as a homicide, saying his heart stopped as police restrained him and compressed his neck, in a widely seen video that has sparked protests across the nation. Protestors line the intersection of 72nd and Dodge on Friday, May 29, 2020, in Omaha to protest the death of George Floyd on Monday night after a Minneapolis Police officer knelt on his neck. (Emily Dwire / WOWT) “Decedent experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s),” the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said in a news release. Cause of death was listed as “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.” Under ""other significant conditions” it said Floyd suffered from heart disease and hypertension, and listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. Those factors were not listed under cause of death. A Minneapolis police officer was charged last week with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, and three other officers were fired. Bystander video showed the officer, Derek Chauvin, holding his knee on Floyd’s neck despite the man's cries that he can't breathe until he eventually stopped moving. A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family also called his death a homicide. It concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression, said the family’s attorney, Ben Crump, who called for the charge against Chauvin to be upgraded to first-degree murder and for three other officers to be charged. He didn't say what the charges against the other officers should be. That autopsy, by a forensic pathologist who also examined Eric Garner’s body, found the compression cut off blood to Floyd’s brain, and that the pressure of other officers' knees on his back made it impossible for him to breathe, Crump said. Both the medical examiner and the family’s experts differed from the description in last week’s criminal complaint against the officer of how Floyd died. The complaint, citing preliminary findings from the medical examiner, listed the effects of being restrained, along with underlying health issues and potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system. But it also said nothing was found “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” Neither side has released its full autopsy report so far. The family's autopsy found no evidence of heart disease and concluded he had been healthy. Floyd, a black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died after Chauvin, who is white, ignored bystander shouts to get off Floyd and Floyd's cries that he couldn't breathe. His death sparked days of protests in Minneapolis and around America. The complaint provided no details about intoxicants. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller described the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Floyd’s family and attorneys, like the families of other black men killed by police, commissioned their own autopsy because they didn’t trust local authorities to produce an unbiased report. The family's autopsy was done by Michael Baden and Allecia Wilson. Baden is the former chief medical examiner of New York City, and was hired to do an autopsy of Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. Baden also did an autopsy at the family's request for Michael Brown, an 18-year-old shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri. He said Brown didn’t reveal signs of a struggle, casting doubt on a claim by police that a struggle between Brown and the officer led to the shooting. Dr. Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist from the San Francisco Bay area who blogs about the subject and is not connected with the case, said the key difference between the medical examiner's conclusions and those of Baden and Walker are the official finding of “significant” conditions for Floyd, including heart disease and drugs in his system. Baden and Wilson acknowledged on a conference call with reporters that they didn't have access to the tissue samples that the medical examiner kept that might have given more information on his health. Nor did they have their own toxicology results yet. Melinek said it's not unusual for different pathologists to reach different determinations, given that they may be looking at different information and that they've had different experiences and training. Under the law, a medical examiner determines the cause and manner of death, but it's up to prosecutors to decide whether criminal charges are warranted. The term homicide means only that a person's death was caused by another person. Chauvin, who was also charged with manslaughter, is being held in a state prison. The other three officers on scene, like Chauvin, were fired the day after the incident but have not been charged. The head of the Minneapolis police union said in a letter to members that the officers were fired without due process and labor attorneys are fighting for their jobs. Lt. Bob Kroll, the union president, also criticized city leadership, saying a lack of support is to blame for the days of sometimes violent protests. When asked to respond, Mayor Jacob Frey said Kroll's opposition to reform and lack of empathy for the community has undermined trust in the police. Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that Attorney General Keith Ellison would take the lead in any prosecutions in Floyd's death. Local civil rights activists have said Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman doesn't have the trust of the black community. They have protested outside his house, and pressed him to charge the other three officers. Freeman remains on the case. ___ Associated Press writer Doug Glass contributed.

The arrests were made Sunday, the first night of an 8 p.m. citywide curfew imposed after some protesters smashed windows, vandalized businesses and set a police car and a city bus on fire during earlier protests. Police had said Sunday night, around 9:45 p.m., that at least two dozen people had been arrested, but Richmond police Chief William Smith updated that number during a news conference Monday, saying a total of 233 people had been arrested. Smith also said that 50 percent of the arrests were people who did not live in Richmond. Police also said a total of 23 guns were seized on Sunday night. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports police used tear gas and pepper spray on demonstrators, who started marching downtown from the defaced Robert E. Lee statue shortly after the curfew took effect. After the arrests broke up the large group of protesters, small pockets of people gathered around downtown and the Virginia Commonwealth University campus. Meanwhile, a man who was hit by gunfire while riding in a car near protesters early Sunday morning remained hospitalized for a life-threatening gunshot wound, police said. Police said gunfire shot from behind the car struck the man as he passed through protesters. Authorities learned about the shooting after being called to a hospital where the man was being treated. Authorities did not identify the victim. Gov. Ralph Northam activated the National Guard in a state of emergency declaration issued Sunday afternoon. Some protesters sprayed graffiti, including “Say His Name” and “George Floyd.” But there were fewer instances of vandalism Sunday. Businesses along Broad Street and elsewhere covered their windows with plywood after numerous businesses were vandalized Saturday and several of the city's Confederate monuments were covered in graffiti. Peaceful protests occurred throughout the day Sunday before the demonstration that ultimately ended in arrests, with many protesters decrying the violence and destruction caused by rioters the night before. Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney issued a curfew for the city of Richmond on Sunday after calling the previous two nights of unrest in Richmond an “insult to the cause” as protesters took to the streets to demand justice for George Floyd, a man killed by a police officer in Minnesota. The mayor held a press conference Sunday morning accompanied by members of Richmond City Council and announced that Governor Northam had granted his request for a curfew to begin at 8 p.m. Sunday. The curfew will run until 6 a.m. nightly through Wednesday, June 3. The protests in Virginia were similar to those across the nation in response to Floyd's death in Minneapolis last week.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) NEW YORK (AP) — The music industry is planning to turn off the music and hold a day to reflect and implement change in response to the death of George Floyd and the killings of other black people. Several top record labels organized Black Out Tuesday as violent protests erupted around the world, sparked by Floyd’s death as well as the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Music-based companies Live Nation and TikTok, as well as the Recording Academy, posted to social media that it planned to support and stand with the black community. “On Tuesday June 2nd, Columbia Records will observe ‘Black Out Tuesday,’” the Sony label home to Beyoncé, Bob Dylan, Adele and John Legend said in a statement. “This is not a day off. Instead, this is a day to reflect and figure out ways to move forward in solidarity.” “We continue to stand with the Black community, our staff, artists, and peers in the music industry,” the company continued. “Perhaps with the music off, we can truly listen.” Others that have joined Black Out Tuesday include the Sony imprints RCA Records and Epic Records; the Universal Music Group divisions Republic Records, Def Jam, UMG Nashville, Capitol Records and Island Records; and the Warner Music Group imprints Atlantic and Warner Records. Smaller, independent labels as well as music publishing companies and management firms have also signed on. UMG’s Interscope Geffen A&M said that in addition to joining Black Out Tuesday, the label home to Lady Gaga and Kendrick Lamar would not release music this week — the first label to do so. “Instead, IGA will contribute to organizations that help to bail out protesters exercising their right to peacefully assemble, aid lawyers working for systemic change and provide assistance to charities focused on creating economic empowerment in the Black community,” its statement read. IGA postponed new music releases MGK, 6lack, Dylan, Jessie Ware, Smokepurp, Lil Mosey, Billy Raffoul, Max Leone and more in coordination with their partners Alamo, LVRN, The Darkroom, Bad Boy and more. Musicians including Rihanna, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Lil Nas X, Demi Lovato, Post Malone and Harry Styles have spoken out following Floyd’s death and worldwide protests. Jay-Z released a statement late Sunday calling for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to prosecute those responsible for killing Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck. “I, along with an entire country in pain, call upon AG Ellison to do the right thing and prosecute all those responsible for the murder of George Floyd to the fullest extent of the law. This is just a first step. I am more determined to fight for justice than any fight my would-be oppressors may have,” Jay-Z said. “I prevail on every politician, prosecutor and officer in the country to have the courage to do what is right. Have the courage to look at us as humans, dads, brothers, sisters and mothers in pain and look at yourselves.” Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Taylor to death in her home in March. The R&B duo Chloe x Halle, who will release their sophomore album “Ungodly Hour” on Friday, posted a cover of the classic civil rights anthem and protest song “We Shall Overcome” to Instagram. “This week has been very heavy for all of us. We’ve been trying to, not understand, because there’s no way to understand the terrible killings — we just have heavy hearts this week and are just trying to do everything we can to pray and lift each other up with our voices,” Halle said in an interview with The Associated Press. “With everything going on, we felt like music can be very healing, because it’s been that way for us in kind of keeping us sane during this time,” Chloe added. As much as we could, we just wanted to share our gift of song to even just lift spirits for even a few seconds.” Latest Posts",0.0

What's next for Minneapolis-area small business owners in danger of losing livelihoods?",https://www.progress-index.com/zz/news/20200601/their-stores-were-burned-ransacked-and-looted-whats-next-for-minneapolis-area-small-business-owners-in-danger-of-losing-livelihoods?rssfeed=true,en,False,,147801,progress-index.com,http://progress-index.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS — Brandy Moore likened the charred remains of her south Minneapolis clothing store and recording studio to the pangs for equality that minorities here feel. Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote. This is the same bunker Vice President Dick Cheney was brought after the September 11 attacks when authorities feared a hijacked plane hijacked was heading toward the White House. President George W. Bush, when he returned to D.C. later that evening, was later taken there after a false alarm of another plane. The recent protests have led to one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since those attacks.",0.0

More than 4,400 arrests have been made at protests nationwide since viral video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day, resulting in Floyd's death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the incident was the right thing to do. Peaceful protests continued to be marred by violence. The Minneapolis Department of Public safety confirmed a semi-truck drove into a group of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35. The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Elsewhere, vandalism and looting continued across the country, as did the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by police in confrontations with protesters. Reports: President Trump hustled to bunker amid Washington protests President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion, according to multiple outlets. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Dozens of Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters over the weekend, and videos showed a large group of protesters – some burning flags and knocking over barricades. CNN reported that the president remained in the bunker for about an hour before returning to the residence, and it is currently unknown whether the First Lady and their son, Barron, were with him. – Savannah Behrmann 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. Illinois governor calls on National Guard to assist Chicago police Vandalism and fires were reported in several Chicago neighborhoods and some suburbs Sunday night after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot severely restricted access to downtown following nights of violent protests. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. ""This has been a scary and unsettling time, but I know we will get through this and begin the process of healing together,"" Lightfoot said in a midnight Twitter post. ""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Protesters vandalize, set fire to police SUVs in New Jersey A group of people was captured on video destroying police SUVs in Trenton, New Jersey. In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.”",0.0
1622606600,2020-06-01 10:51:55,What is antifa and what does the movement want?,https://www.progress-index.com/zz/news/20200601/what-is-antifa-and-what-does-movement-want?rssfeed=true,en,False,,147801,progress-index.com,http://progress-index.com/,"Antifa — short for ""anti-fascist"" — is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents.""

New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015. Some Cincinnati City Council members tweeted from the rally. – Sarah Brookbank, Cincinnati Enquirer Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0
1622606593,2020-06-01 12:10:10,George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. What do we tell our children?,https://www.progress-index.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,147801,progress-index.com,http://progress-index.com/,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

In downtown Richmond, protests over the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department turned violent. Richmond Police armed in protective riot gear clashed with protesters throughout the district, and the results were burned-down stores, burned-up vehicles and hundreds of burned eyes from tear gas and pepper spray used to control the crowds. Meanwhile, 25 miles to the south, about 20 people stood outside the Petersburg Police headquarters on North Adams Street Sunday afternoon waving signs and encouraging people to honk their horns for justice — and the police were right out there with them, showing their support. “It was just so much camaraderie out there,” said Tarsha Blowe, who organized Sunday’s protest. “I just cannot say enough about Chief [Kenneth] Miller and all the officers who were out there with us.” Not only did the officers stand outside the headquarters with the protesters, but also, Blowe said, the department provided them with shade and refreshments as needed. Blowe, a Petersburg native now living in Hopewell, said the idea for a protest came to her early Sunday as she was trying to decide the best way to get her message across: “I just felt moved to do something.” But she did not want a repeat of what had been happening in Richmond the previous two nights because “I’m just not about all that.” So she called a few friends, and in the end, about 20 people joined her alongside North Adams Street. The solidarity shown by the Petersburg Police made Sunday’s event even more poignant. “The police officers are with their people. They supported us,” she said. No major issues came up during Sunday’s protest at the station. Blowe said motorists adhered to requests from those gathered to honk their horns for justice. “There were a lot of horns,” she recalled. “I was out there from 1 to 4, and only one car went by sticking up their middle finger.” Blowe said a similar rally is planned for 5 p.m. Monday at the Petersburg Police station. Two others who organized local protests over the weekend echoed Blowe’s sentiment that both police and protesters have to be on the same page. “They don’t have the support of the people they need,” Tyquan Lewis said of the uproar in Richmond. Lewis said instead of Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney meeting the people out on the streets and giving them an avenue to address their concerns, he asked for curfews to be enforced and the Virginia National Guard to be called in. “We had the support of all sides [here] ... the police, the community,” he noted. Both Petersburg’s Miller and Colonial Heights Police Chief Jeff Faries were out over the weekend commending them for their efforts. “We wanted to show we can protest the right way,” Lewis said. Added co-organizer Jhovan Galberth, “We have to lead by example. If we had gone out there all rowdy and saying, ’F the cops,’ then that would have turned out very bad.” During Friday’s protest — which Lewis said was impromptu after he a small group gathered in downtown Petersburg — they walked across the bridge into Colonial Heights, then paused in the middle of the Boulevard for nine minutes, the amount of time Floyd was held down by police in Minneapolis before he passed away. Once that was done, the group turned back toward Petersburg. Lewis said Faries walked with them down to the bridge and posed for photos with them and Miller, the Petersburg police chief. “We had people getting out of their cars and wanting to join us,” Lewis said. The next day, Galberth said, the group followed the same path, paused for the nine minutes and then returned to Petersburg. Another protest took place Sunday evening. “Our goal was to make sure our message got out peacefully and not try to provoke any responses,” Lewis said, adding that they plan to do similar protests again next weekend.

Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him. So had the large crowds during a time when he is trying to keep his distance from people over fears of spreading the new coronavirus. He instead decided to clean the streets and sidewalks, only to find that hundreds of others had the same idea. “The longer this goes on, the more I realize I’m going to remember this the rest of my life,” Manderscheid said. Meanwhile, Dan Halvorsen picked up trash and swept away debris along with seven other members of his church in suburban Bloomington. “We wanted to perform a good deed. Our hearts are just breaking about this whole situation,” he said. “By the time we got here, the response has been so amazing, that there wasn’t a big need for us.” Other residents found a way to help by providing food, diapers and other essentials in a city where most stores and restaurants are closed. That’s how Tracy Gray Knutson found herself an unwitting, but perfectly willing, Santa Claus of sorts. Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse. Gross, 52, jokingly called himself a barista/counselor/bouncer at two businesses that share a building: Powwow Grounds Coffee and All My Relations Gallery. The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0

Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place. The merits of the protesters' cause ""doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. At least one protester in Tampa, Florida, is known to have COVID-19. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who expressed dismay last week about Floyd's death, tweeted Monday that five of his officers were exposed to the protester, whom he did not identify. Protesting – especially without a mask – can put people at higher risk for infection, said Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" he said during a Monday media availability. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Viral photos: A photo page of striking moments from the week’s protests. As businesses re-open, it will be difficult to figure out whether someone caught the virus at a protest or in some other encounter, Mina said. Hopefully, the fact that protests are taking place out of doors, will dilute the virus and reduce disease transmission, he said. Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit."" There is historical precedent to suggest that viruses can be spread by large public gatherings. In September 1918, people in Philadelphia held a parade to celebrate the return of soldiers from World War I. The gathering of 200,000 people, crammed shoulder to shoulder, reignited a deadly flu epidemic, leading to massive closures and thousands of deaths, records show. Yet, there's a public health cost to not protesting the status quo, said Dr. Hillary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and immediate past president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. ""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said. She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said. ""It's a little disingenuous to say that the health risk from protesting is somehow bigger than the health risk at Lake of Ozarks (where people gathered for fun over Memorial Day weekend) or the practices that brought us to this point in the first place."" At least one reveler at the lake party tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Camden County Health Department. Others were advised to monitor for symptoms. Babcock said it is possible to minimize the risks of protesting, with masks, social distancing and asking sick people to stay home. Arresting people and putting them into close contact with others increases risk, Babcock said, as does spraying protesters with pepper spray, which causes violent coughing and can potentially spread the virus. Timeline: George Floyd protests: How did we get here? Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency room physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, said there is risk of longer-term effects in communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Wen was Baltimore's health commissioner when protests erupted following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. The death triggered civil unrest in communities already burdened with deep-seated inequities, she said. ""When over a dozen pharmacies burned down and closed and stores were looted, it was community members themselves who were affected the most,"" Wen said. While protests over the past week following Floyd's death have highlighted police-community relations, demonstrators are also calling attention to social justice issues, including health disparities. ""The same communities that are already the most affected are potentially going to have an increase in the number of cases as a result of people gathering,"" Wen said. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets, even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Meanwhile, state and local public health agencies plan to monitor for new COVID-19 cases. Any large gathering during a pandemic is a concern, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the Massachusetts Covid Response project. Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, handles Massachusetts’ contact tracing of individuals infected with or exposed to the virus. Following such a large gathering, potential cases need to be monitored over two weeks, the virus’s incubation period. “The epidemic curve should guide the response and the phased reopening of society,"" Welch said. ""Until the epidemic is declared over, social distancing and wearing masks should remain the new normal."" Peter Pitts, president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a nonpartisan research and educational organization, said he worries COVID-19 will take advantage of people gathering to protest police violence.

Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, rallied with protesters in Providence this past weekend. “My heart is broken,” Cicilline said. “People are sick and tired of this and they’re looking for the leaders in government to provide not only some comfort, some acknowledgment that their pain is real but some commitment to do something about it.” Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, said the violence and destruction of property in some parts of the nation aren’t reflective of the majority of the protesters. “The vast majority of protestors have been non-violent and filled with righteous anger and indignation,” Raskin said. Raskin said Congress can take action on the issue of black men dying at the hands of police. “What we’re going to have to do is tie federal money to adopting the best practices to get rid of racists cops and to adhere to the highest levels of performance,” Raskin said. With demonstrations on-going, during a conference call Monday, President Donald Trump told governors they are “weak” for not “dominating” the streets. From the Kennedy Space Center this weekend, Trump said the memory of Floyd is being dishonored by rioters and looters. “We can’t and must not allow a small group of criminals and vandals to wreck our cities and lay waste to our communities,” Trump said. “My administration will stop mob violence and we’ll stop it cold.” Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C. and Miami to help stop the violence.",0.0
1622621502,2020-06-01 14:39:00,Biden Meets With Black Faith Leaders In Delaware Following Days Of Protest,https://www.wmra.org/post/biden-meets-black-faith-leaders-delaware-following-days-protest,en,False,,144825,wmra.org,http://wmra.org/,"In his first in-person campaign event in more than two months, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden met Monday with community leaders at a predominantly African American church in his hometown to address the outrage and protests surrounding George Floyd's death. Protests have erupted in dozens of cities over the past week since Floyd, a black man, died after a police officer was seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck for minutes on end. ""I think the public is getting to a place that it's never been before in understanding a lot of this,"" Biden said at the event. ""But it's going to take a whole hell of a lot of hard work. A lot of hard work. But I'm confident it can be done."" Fourteen faith leaders and local lawmakers attended the event at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Del., as they donned masks and sat seated two to a pew to help maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus. Biden spent more than half of the event listening to the concerns of community leaders rather than delivering remarks. He could be seen taking notes as each attendee got up and spoke. Despite being in a room full of supporters, the group offered critical feedback to the former vice president, with some saying the black community didn't get the economic boost it needed under the Obama administration and that Biden's role in passing the 1994 crime bill makes some young black voters skeptical of him. There were recommendations to create a czar dedicated solely to the study of police brutality within Biden's first 100 days as president. Several speakers urged Biden to pick an African American woman as his vice president. U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., spoke emotionally of a recent exchange she had with a 23-year-old protester in Wilmington, who told her he was ""willing to die."" ""He said, 'I have so much rage.' And I said, 'How old are you? What's your name? How old are you?' And I just tried to hold him, COVID or not,"" the congresswoman said. After about an hour, Biden rose to address the church gathering. ""I want to make something clear: I don't expect anything from the black community,"" he said. ""It has to be earned, earned every single time."" Biden said he's spent time speaking with black thought leaders about how to move forward as a country and said people who ""don't think of themselves as having a prejudiced bone in their body"" are now reckoning with the discrimination endemic in some American institutions. ""The Band-Aid's been ripped off by this pandemic and this president. No one can pretend any longer what this is all about. Nobody can pretend who has been carrying us on our backs — it's the minorities,"" Biden said. Biden listed specific plans for his would-be administration, including heightened federal oversight over local law enforcement, additional training for police officers and increased economic opportunity for African Americans. He teased the announcement of a new economic proposal in the coming weeks, which he said will have a strong emphasis on housing, education and access to capital. ""The ultimate answer for every other group has been access to economic opportunity,"" Biden said. ""What is the future? The future is you gotta be able to get out of bed and think, 'I can make it, I can do something. The deck's not completely stacked.' "" He also stressed what he characterized as a critical need to change leadership in the Senate, particularly as it relates to confirming federal judges. ""If we don't win back the United States Senate, we're going to be in real trouble,"" Biden said. ""Presidents come and go. But I tell you what, justices don't. They last a long time."" The event ended with a prayer and Biden saying he'll rely on the group for advice throughout his campaign. ""I know I'm going to make mistakes,"" he said before quoting the expression, ""What comes from the heart goes straight to the heart."" ""It's going to come from the heart. But I'll need help,"" the former vice president said. ""I need help and advice as we go along as to what you think I should and shouldn't be doing."" The event marked Biden's third public appearance in a week, his first trips away from his home since mid-March. He has been campaigning from his house due to coronavirus lockdown orders. Biden left his home on Memorial Day to lay a wreath at a veterans park near his home, and on Sunday he visited a site in Wilmington where protesters had gathered the night before in response to Floyd's death. Biden held a virtual meeting with mayors later in the day and had virtual fundraisers planned for Monday evening. ",0.0

(WRIC) — Chesterfield’s police chief called “dissent and protest” healthy in a Facebook post Monday, but said violent demonstrations in the wake of George Floyd’s death were unacceptable and that the county’s police department is prepared to thwart any “criminal outbursts.” Floyd died a week ago today after an encounter with four Minneapolis police officers who were responding to a call that he had allegedly used counterfeit money to purchase cigarettes from a local store. Video taken from the scene showed the officers pin Floyd, who was handcuffed, to the ground for several minutes. All of the officers involved were fired and the officer seen on video kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he complained that he couldn’t breathe, Derek Chauvin, was eventually charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Floyd’s death has sparked protests across the country. In order to reassure residents of their commitment “to maintain the trust of the public,” the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police and some local police chiefs issued statements on May 29 after charges against Chauvin were announced. Since then, protests in Richmond and across Virginia have taken place over the last three days. Chesterfield County Police Chief Jeffrey Katz wrote that he’s received several messages from community members “concerned about local riots spreading into” the county. Katz said that Chesterfield police welcomes and supports “all First Amendment expression,” but warned of groups hijacking “reasonable and appropriate protests.” “Dissent and protest are healthy. Rioting is not. I want to take some time to reassure each of you that we are well prepared to support those who seek our assistance in safely exercising their First Amendment Rights. We are also prepared to quickly quell violent criminal outbursts in our community and prosecute these folks to the fullest extent of the law,” Col. Katz wrote. “Hijacking a righteous message and drowning out the fears and concerns of vulnerable and scared people in our community with violence, chaos, and destruction is not okay. This is where we draw the line. If it comes our way, we will deal with it accordingly.” LATEST HEADLINES:",0.0

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — City officials briefed the public on Sunday night's protest in Virginia Beach that ended with destruction and vandalism. It started out as a peaceful march calling for swift justice and action in the wake of George Floyd's death. Then, chaos broke loose after a small number of protesters started smashing windows of different storefronts and looting shops that line the Oceanfront. Mayor Bobby Dyer, Acting Police Chief Tony Zucaro and Director of Office Emergency Management Erin Sutton spoke about the demonstration on Monday afternoon. Zucaro called the start of protests at the Oceanfront Sunday night ""remarkable,"" but says things became violent around 10 p.m. According to the acting police chief, protesters began throwing objects at the officers and storefronts, and he also claimed the crowd dispersed tear gas at Virginia Beach police officers. He said the police then responded with tear gas of their own. Officials said that 48 businesses total were damaged, with estimates over $300,000. In their update, police said there were 19 arrests (28 charges) made at the Oceanfront. Two were felony charges, 16 were misdemeanor, and one was a traffic summons. Four were from Virginia areas outside of Hampton Roads. Two were from elsewhere. Additionally, two officers had minor injuries during the confrontations, Zucaro said. One had a twisted ankle, while the other head and neck injuries from being hit by a cinderblock. Both are OK. One citizen also suffered minor injuries, which Zucaro described as scrapes and cuts from a hit-and-run where a private car was trying to leave. Virginia Beach Police also say that National Guard troops will begin assisting them on Monday night. 13News Now spoke with Mayor Dyer Monday morning as cleanup efforts began. ""When things turn to destruction of property and things of that nature, that's where we hope to draw the line,"" Dyer said. In a message to protesters, Dyer said, ""Get your message out peacefully.

If anyone in the community is aware of who the operator or the occupants of that vehicle are, I would encourage them to call our detective bureau.” 10 On Your Side’s Andy Fox found the driver and interviewed him Monday before the press briefing, unaware at the time that police were looking to speak to the driver.

He denies that. “If I was going to run over people, why wouldn’t I start with the female protestor standing in front of me as I was trying to leave? I wouldn’t run her over, but she was standing in front of me.” A protestor can also be seen striking Manny with a stick-like object, and he showed the arm wound as proof according to him. “I was creeping forward.

Your article on this protest, published online Sunday afternoon, identified county Chairwoman Phyllis Randall, Rep. Jennifer Weston, and Leesburg Town Council member Ron Campbell among the organizers or participants I wish to say at the outset, and stress, that my anger has nothing whatsoever to do with the subject of the protest or the merits thereof. Rather, it is due to the lack of judgment, questionable priorities, and lack of concern shown for the citizens of our town by these individuals. My objections are based on two reasons: First, given the prior and ongoing violence as close as Washington, D.C. and Richmond, and the numerous news reports of outside agitators contributing to this violence, our elected officials had no way of knowing if this demonstration, regardless of the organizers’ good intentions, would have remained peaceful (as luckily it did) or would have brought the violence to the middle of our community. This was not something the organizers could have controlled and it was only by luck that violence did not occur. This was a risk that should not have been taken. Second, our businesses and citizens are still suffering from the closures, layoffs, and disruptions of COVID 19. We are still subject to our governor’s order limiting gatherings to 10 people. While most of the protestors, based on the photograph published in this newspaper on Sunday, were wearing facemasks, we all know by now that those masks, with the exception of N95 masks reserved for healthcare and other at-risk professionals, only protect others from an infected person wearing the mask. They do not protect other persons wearing a mask from an infected person who is not. There appeared to be several persons in the crowd not wearing masks, and at the time of the speeches, were not social distancing. The risk of increasing the infection rate in our town is significant. Churches and other places of worship have been closed and are now subject to severe limitations. Why are the First Amendment rights of churchgoers less important than those of the protesters who blatantly violated the governor’s order? What does it say to the struggling businesses and citizens of our town, who have been trying their best, sometimes at huge cost and sacrifice, to comply with the restrictions imposed on them, that the priorities of these politicians are such that they deemed staging this protest more important than the health, livelihood and rights of the rest of the citizens of Leesburg? Our frustrations with politicians who exercised such arrogance should be voiced at the polls in November. Sharon L. Babbin, Leesburg",0.0

This comes in light of what the city’s Fire Chief, Mike Jones, called a ‘civil disturbance’ that Fredericksburg faced on May 31 when peaceful protests turned unruly and people refused to disperse. Protestors, as well as Virginia Delegate Joshua Cole, were subdued with tear gas by police. “What started out as a peaceful protest later turned into an angry group of people who would not listen to reason when told to disperse. This resulted in the need to take measures to protect our citizens and their properties. We do not wish to see a repeat of this again,” said Chief Jones. “Tear gas was deployed to disperse the crowds who threatened innocent bystanders and police, were unsafely blocking streets, throwing rocks, and vandalizing vehicles as well as historic structures after being giving multiple attempts to leave,” said Fredericksburg police spokeswoman Sarah Kirkpatrick. With additional protests planned for today, June 1, citizens are urged to keep things peaceful. “We respect the right of people to express their views and when demonstrations or protests are run peacefully, they can be an advantage to a community. When bad actors from outside the area inject themselves with the intent to spread hate and criminal actions, we all as a community lose. Don’t let folks from out of the area come to our great city and make it less of a place. All folks in Fredericksburg work hard each and every day to make this a better place to live. Let’s keep it that way,” said Chief Jones. The May 31 protests, which were held due to the killing of George Floyd, a Minneapolis resident who was being placed under arrest by a former police officer, Derek Chauvin, began in the early evening with what police estimate to have been 250-300 people. As the crowd marched from Princess Anne Street to Cowan Boulevard, Fredericksburg police declared an unlawful assembly. “Officers continued to ask protestors to leave the area, which they ignored. At approximately 8:34pm, when the protestors arrived at the intersection of Route One and Cowan Boulevard, they made a straight line for Police Headquarters at which time officers deployed gas,” read a statement from the Fredericksburg police department. By 10:30 p.m. officers were still trying to disperse protestors, some of whom were ‘throwing rocks at officers’ according to the Fredericksburg police department. No arrests were made and no police or civilian injuries were reported. A Declaration of Local Emergency was later declared by City Manager, Time Baroody and Fredericksburg Police requested that residents shelter-in-place.

Armory, Monday, June 1, 2020, in Washington. Protests have erupted across the United States to protest the death of Floyd, a black man who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) WASHINGTON – U.S. officials vowed to “maximize federal law enforcement presence” in the nation’s capital Monday night after days of violent demonstrations led to fires across Washington and left scores of businesses with broken windows and dozens of police officers injured. In a call with governors, President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The comments from Trump, Barr and other federal officials appeared aimed at avoiding similar scenes Monday night, when protesters were expected to gather again. But there were also questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Barr told the state leaders that law enforcement officials must “have adequate force” and “go after troublemakers.” “Law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets,” Barr said. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.” Trump directed Barr to “lead federal law enforcement efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia,” Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said. Minutes before Trump spoke Monday evening in the Rose Garden of the White House, police and members of the National Guard took aggressive action, using tear gas and flash bangs, to move back peaceful protesters who were outside Lafayette Park, across from the White House. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. Barr has also directed the federal Bureau of Prisons to send teams of prison riot officers to patrol the streets in Miami and Washington, the official added. The federal prison system had also implemented a temporary measure to further curtail inmate movement at prisons across the U.S. “to ensure the good order and security of our institutions, as well as ensure the safety of staff and inmates,"" the Bureau of Prisons said. Barr was traveling around Washington on Monday night to observe the protests, according to the senior Justice Department official, who would not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The FBI is using its network of regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and federal prosecutors across the country have been instructed to share information and utilize federal riot, arson or terror statutes against any “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. The FBI has already started questioning rioters who were arrested in several cities to determine whether they committed any federal crimes, the senior Justice Department official said. It is a federal crime to cross state lines to participate in violent riots. Between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states — Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Utah — are being sent to D.C. to provide assistance, senior Defense Department officials said. Those troops are either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. In addition, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. In addition, members of the Army’s 3rd Infantry Regiment, an active-duty unit known as the Old Guard and most visible as the unit that stands at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, have been called up to protect Fort Myer, Virginia, the U.S. Army post adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery. The officials said some of the National Guard in D.C. will be armed and others will not.

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has blamed antifa activists for violence at protests over police killings of black people, but antifa isn’t an organization and targeting it isn’t so simple. A look at what antifa is and is not: WHAT IS ANTIFA? Short for “anti-fascists,” antifa is not a single organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. There is no hierarchical structure to antifa or universal set of tactics that makes its presence immediately recognizable, though members tend to espouse revolutionary and anti-authoritarian views, said Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University and author of “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.” “They do different things at different times in different ways, some of which there is evidence of them breaking the law. Other times there is not,” Bray said. Literature from the antifa movement encourages followers to pursue lawful protest activity as well as more confrontational acts, according to a 2018 Congressional Research Service report. The literature suggests that followers monitor the activities of white supremacist groups, publicize online the personal information of perceived enemies, develop self-defense training regimens and compel outside organizations to cancel any speakers or events with “a fascist bent,” the report said. People associated with antifa have been present for significant demonstrations and counter-demonstrations over the last three years, sometimes involving brawls and property damage. They mobilized against a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 and have clashed repeatedly with far-right groups in Portland, Oregon, including at a protest and counter-demonstration last summer that resulted in arrests and the seizure of shields, poles and other weapons. WHAT ROLE IS ANTIFA PLAYING IN THESE DEMONSTRATIONS? Trump and members of his administration have singled out antifa as being responsible for the violence at protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. In a pair of statements over the weekend, Attorney General William Barr described “antifa-like tactics"" by out-of-state agitators and said antifa was instigating violence and engaging in “domestic terrorism"" and would be dealt with accordingly. At a White House appearance Monday, Trump blamed antifa by name for the violence, along with violent mobs, arsonists and looters. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters earlier in the day that antifa is a “big element of this protest,"" though she deferred to the Justice Department on the question of how one could be identified as a member. But it's unclear how big its involvement is. Bray said that although he believes people associated with antifa are participating in the demonstrations, it is difficult to establish how big of a role they're playing since there is no official roster of members and since the movement lacks the numbers to mobilize nationwide in such a dramatic, forceful way. “The radical left is much bigger than antifa— much, much bigger — and the number of people who are participating in the property destruction are much, much bigger than the radical left,” Bray said. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. WHAT DOES THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANT TO DO ABOUT ANTIFA? Trump tweeted Sunday, “The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" It's not the first time he's endorsed that approach. Trump expressed a similar sentiment last summer, joining some Republican lawmakers in calling for antifa to be designated as a terror organization after the skirmishes in Portland. CAN THE ADMINISTRATION DO THAT? For one thing, antifa is not a discrete or centralized group, so it's unclear how the government could give it a designation. Beyond that, though, antifa is a domestic entity and, as such, not a candidate for inclusion on the State Department's list of foreign terror organizations. Those groups, which include Islamic extremist organizations and the Real Irish Republican Army, are based overseas rather than in the U.S. That designation matters for a variety of legal reasons, not least of which anyone in the United States who lends material support to an organization on that list is subject to terrorism-related charges. But “there is not a domestic equivalent,” said Joshua Geltzer, a former senior counterterrorism official in the Obama White House and founding executive director at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at the Georgetown University Law Center. There have been periodic calls, particularly after mass shootings by white supremacists, to establish a domestic terrorism law. But no singular domestic terrorism statute now exists. Asked Monday what legal authority the president would have for labeling antifa a terror organization, McEnany pointed to the existing statute under the U.S. criminal code that defines acts of domestic and international terrorism. But defining an act of terrorism is different than designating an entire U.S. group as a terror organization. “US law does the 1st. It doesn’t permit the 2nd,"" Geltzer tweeted after McEnany's remarks. Even if antifa is not a designated terror organization, FBI Director Chris Wray has made clear that it's on the radar of federal law enforcement. He has said that while the FBI does not investigate on the basis of ideology, agents have pursued investigations across the country against people motivated to commit crimes and acts of violence ""on kind of an antifa ideology."" ___ Associated Press writers Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Ore., and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

Hundreds watched the noon time demonstration. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) LOS ANGELES – Jamie Foxx stood shoulder-to-shoulder with activists in Minneapolis, proclaiming that “we’re not afraid of the moment.” In Los Angeles, pop star Halsey and “Insecure” actor Kendrick Sampson were hit with rubber bullets during a tense stand-off. And in Chicago, John Cusack was filming a burning car when officers rushed up to him and began screaming at him to leave, and he says, hitting his bike. Across the U.S., many celebrities have been doing far more than tweeting supportive words or issuing carefully prepared statements. They took to the streets alongside thousands of people to condemn the killings of black people at the hands of police and to demand reform. “I was there in LA when it was the Rodney King beating and I watched that, and I said ‘Man, if they get away with this what’s going to happen later?’ And it continues to happen,” Foxx said Monday in San Francisco, where he joined church leaders and activists in a “kneel-in.” Foxx's comments came three days after he flew to Minneapolis to join the chorus of anger over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being pinned under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer for several minutes even after he became unresponsive. “As I’m talking to my nephews, as I’m talking to my daughter, trying to telling them how to act when they’re out there and they see a police officer, I’m sort of running out of things to tell them and it shouldn’t be that way,” Foxx said in San Francisco. “It shouldn’t be that way in America in 2020. We have to evolve.” Many celebrities turned out Saturday and Sunday at sometimes intense protests in Los Angeles, including one outside a popular, high-end shopping mall where protesters took over a city bus, tagged buildings and burned police cars. Model and activist Emily Ratajkowski waved a sign that read “Dismantle power structures of oppression,” Paris Jackson carried one that said “Peace Love Justice” and rapper Machine Gun Kelly ’s said, “Silence is betrayal.” Pop star Ariana Grande tweeted that “we chanted, people beeped and cheered along.” Sampson (“Insecure,” “How to Get Away With Murder”) on Saturday grabbed a microphone. “Our solutions are not defined by systems that oppression built!” he shouted. “America was founded on racism, anti-blackness and genocide. When you talk about America, don’t leave that s--- out.” Later Sampson was shown at the front of a standoff with police. Some of the details of the video aren’t clear, but Sampson said on Instagram that a rubber bullet that police shot into the ground ricocheted and hit his assistant. The video shows Sampson step in front of his assistant and an officer hit him at least twice with a baton. “Then an officer aims straight at me, no ricochet, and shoots (rubber bullets)” Sampson wrote. “That was one of seven shots I took. They are excruciating. And they CAN kill.” Nearby, Halsey, who was at the protest with ex-boyfriend and recording artist Yungblud, also reported being hit with rubber bullets and getting tear-gassed. “We were peaceful. Hands up, not moving, not breaching the line,” she wrote on Instagram. “They opened fire of rubber bullets and tear gas multiple times on U.S. citizens who were not provoking them.” Los Angeles police did not respond to a request for comment about their actions at the scene. Halsey was back out protesting Sunday in nearby Santa Monica, where many demonstrators acted peacefully but others continued a third day of looting in the Los Angeles area. Recording artist Madison Beer tweeted Sunday for people to leave Santa Monica immediately. “I was just tear gassed,” she wrote. “They are arresting everyone and tear gassing all crowds.” Among the hundreds arrested at that mostly peaceful demonstration was “Riverdale” actor Cole Sprouse, who wrote on Instagram that “this is precisely the time to contemplate what it means to stand as an ally.” “I hope others in my position do, as well,” he said. While some celebrities chose to demonstrate, others took to social media to express their disapproval of looting. “Everyone is angry but there is a way to direct that anger,” actor/director Taika Waititi wrote on Twitter on Saturday. In another tweet, he wrote: “The police seem to be enjoying this. You’re inciting the chaos, dudes!"" After peaceful protests turned violent in Atlanta on Friday, director Tyler Perry pleaded on Instagram to “please stop this violence!” “Looting is NOT THE ANSWER!!!!” he said. That night rapper Killer Mike, whose cousin is an Atlanta police officer, spoke alongside Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and gave an impassioned speech that soon went viral. “It is your duty not to burn your own house down for anger with an enemy,” he said, adding that he has a lot of love and respect for police while also acknowledging that some of them have done “horrendous” things. On Monday, Perry posted on Instagram that he personally spoke with George Floyd's immediate family, and that “'they are adamant in their call for peaceful protest.” In San Francisco, Foxx urged more of his fellow celebrities to step up. “What I want to say about my Hollywood friends, you’ve got to get out here,” he said. “You can’t sit back, you can’t tweet, you can’t text ... When you hear and when you see how people are hurting, you can understand what it is as opposed to being in your bedroom or your living room and saying, ‘Hey I don’t like this.’ Get out of the cul-de-sac and come down here on the courtroom steps.” Tank joined Foxx and sang a powerful rendition of Sam Cooke’s “A Change is Gonna Come.” “A change is gonna come,” Tank told the crowd afterward. “As long as we keep doing this, a change is gonna come.”",0.0

Manassas police spokeswoman Sarah Maroney said, after a group of peaceful protesters left, new ones showed and starting throwing objects, which ended up smashing the glass of businesses like Glory Days Grill. “Protestors unaffiliated with the original organizers began arriving and the crowd grew into the later hours of the evening. Protestors began demonstrating in the roadway and were allowed to do so while they remained peaceful. Officers in the area then reported objects being thrown at them and also observed property damage. At approximately 11:31 p.m., the Manassas City Police Department declared an unlawful assembly. Officers announced the declaration to the protestors and the crowd was dispersed.” Manassas City Police Chief, Doug Keen, met with organizers and addressed the crowds along with leaders from the Prince William County Police Department. The original organizers of the protest remained peaceful throughout the evening. The earlier, peaceful protest began at 5 p.m. at a WaWa gas station on Liberia Avenue, near the intersection of Signal Hill Road. Protesters called for unity, and an end to racial profiling following the death of George Floyd, who died when a former Minneapolis police officer was attempting to arrest him. That former police officer is now charged in his death. Manassas City Police Chief, Doug Keen, met with organizers and addressed the crowds along with leaders from the Prince William County Police Department. The event also drew Manassas City Mayor Hal Parrish II. “What’s happening right now, is people coming together and trying to talk about the issue that in some instances, divide us and that is an important conversation to have. Protests are okay, peaceful protests are even better, and violence and chaos are not good for a community and its reputation,” Parrish told Potomac Local News. Sunday’s protest drew about 300 people by 6 p.m. It followed a violent protest that occurred five miles west of the city, at the intersection of Sudley Road and Sudley Manor Drive. Tear gas and rubber bullets were used to disperse the crowd, multiple police officers were injured, and several arrests were made. Brandon Garner, of Manassas, shared his feelings about the protests while attending the event Sunday evening on Liberia Avenue. “It can happen anywhere. Doesn’t matter where you come from. Doesn’t matter your background, your pedigree, your history, it can happen anywhere with anybody and we got to attack it being as it is the first thing America as a country has done.” Ja’Neese Jefferson, who also lives in Manassas, also spoke with Potomac Local News. “I don’t think we ever actually solved the issues of racism, bigotry, and systematic oppression since the 1960s, we could even take it back all the way to 1619 when we first arrived here…it’s disheartening that we have to keep doing this time and time again because America will not acknowledge our existence, but instead wants to fight our resistance instead of just actually giving us what we need and not beating around the bush about it.” Joshua Wesley from Chapel Springs Church in Bristow, who also lead the 300 protest attendees, told his side on how he felt for the protests.",0.0

Richmond’s mayor and its police chief apologized after videos surfaced on social media of people being gassed before the curfew was in effect. Floyd died a week ago today after an encounter with four Minneapolis police officers who were responding to a call that he had allegedly used counterfeit money to purchase cigarettes from a local store. Video taken from the scene showed the officers pin Floyd, who was handcuffed, to the ground for several minutes. All of the officers involved were fired and the officer seen on video kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he complained that he couldn’t breathe, Derek Chauvin, was eventually charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. In order to reassure residents of their commitment “to maintain the trust of the public,” the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police and some local police chiefs issued statements on May 29 after charges against Chauvin were announced. Since then, protests in Richmond and across Virginia have taken place over the last three days.

To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: America's police officers are at the center of a national storm. They are hearing the rage over what happened to George Floyd at the same time they've been tasked with containing the violence. Some have been accused of cracking down on legitimate protesters, others criticized for being too permissive toward vandals and looters. To give us a sense of what the nation's police officers are thinking right now, we're joined by NPR's law enforcement correspondent Martin Kaste, who's been talking with his police sources today. Hi, Martin. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: First, just give us a sense of the mood of the police officers that you're talking to. KASTE: The mood is gloomy. It's tense. And I think it's fair to say that there is some fear I've heard in some of the things I've heard from especially officers who are kind of on the front lines of crowd control and scenes we've seen so much in the last couple of days. There's also kind of a sense of frustration for a lot of officers when they hear what they think - what they perceive to be sort of a note of understanding or the sense that it's acceptable that this kind of violence, this looting and arson accompany these protests - they find that kind of frustrating. SHAPIRO: Are they angry just about the violence or also about the public response condemning the Minneapolis police involved in the death of George Floyd or, in some cases, about the actions of police officers that, you know, wear the badge as well? KASTE: Well, this anger I was talking about is about this violence. To be clear, when it comes to Minneapolis cops in that video, the police - it's actually struck me how unanimous they've been in condemning - from early on, from last week - condemning what they saw in that video. I've heard cops just going off on those Minneapolis police officers, saying they've made it so much harder to be a police officer in this country now. And you know, I was talking about this yesterday with Robert Hollis, who's a police patrol commander in Kent, Wash., which is a very diverse suburb of Seattle. And he told me that as a black man, he felt sick to his stomach watching that video of Floyd. But he also saw some reason for hope in this sort of widespread condemnation he was hearing from this world of policing. ROBERT HOLLIS: Numerous unions, numerous police chiefs are coming out and saying, this is not the type of officer that we want - 'cause I guarantee you five years ago, it would be more of a, let's wait and see what's going on. Let's hold off, wait for all the facts to come out. But this time, it was outcry from the get-go. SHAPIRO: And as an African American police officer, what is his take on the protesters' accusation that the police are inherently racist, that there are unfortunate trends and, you know, that it run through the institution? KASTE: Well, I mean, he took a nuanced approach to this when we were talking about it. You know, he said that policing, by its very nature, changes slowly. But he thinks, also, that in his 19 years as an officer, he has seen substantive improvements. One example he gave is his own department. A few years ago, they still permitted that knee-to-the-neck technique that we saw used on George Floyd. But a few years ago, a trainer said, this is dangerous. And the department banned it. And he also thinks the implicit bias training of just the last few years, the last five or six years has kind of shaped the views of the new generation of leaders inside of police departments, which may be behind this sort of unanimous condemnation we're hearing. But he still said that he understands that when people see something like this case with George Floyd, that they say, if one of you did it, you all did it. HOLLIS: I don't blame them. At the same time, I still would say to those community members, you need to keep working with us, and we want to keep - continue to keep working with you because we recognize that there's a need to change. We're doing our best to try and make those changes. SHAPIRO: Just briefly, Martin, as somebody who's been covering these issues since before Ferguson, do you see the same kind of gradual improvement that Commander Hollis is describing? KASTE: There have definitely been policy changes. There's been sort of a change in attitude in departments on how use of force is used and documented. But you know, policing is a patchwork in this country. There's some talk now about changing the rules under which police can be sued. SHAPIRO: OK. KASTE: That's something that Congress is now maybe picking up the next few days. That might be something that unites left and right. SHAPIRO: NPR's Martin Kaste, thank you. KASTE: You're welcome.

Police have cited concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. The rally has been held each year since 1990 to commemorate the lives lost in the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The Chinese military opened fire on citizens who were calling for economic and democratic reforms. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil, told the South China Morning Post that alliance members still planned to enter Victoria Park to observe a moment of silence that night. The alliance also asked the public to join an online gathering and light candles across the city. NPR's Emily Feng reported that the move to deny the demonstration comes amid controversy surrounding China's proposed national security law that could limit Hong Kong's autonomy. The potential law has concerned pro-democracy advocates, and as Feng noted, ""Legal scholars question whether Beijing has the authority to impose this law on Hong Kong."" In justifying an earlier extension of restrictions to June 4, police cited a lingering threat of the spread of the coronavirus, The Guardian reported. ""Police believe the event will not only increase participants' chances of contracting the virus, but also threaten citizens' lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others,"" police said, according to the newspaper. Lee Cheuk-yan, who chairs the alliance that organized the event, told the South China Morning Post that he believes the government was using the pandemic to shut down the demonstration. ""We believe this is totally unreasonable and unscientific, because everything is normal in Hong Kong. They are just using this excuse to suppress our rally,"" he said, adding that many other facilities had already reopened. ",0.0

But some health experts, even as they urge caution, said they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat. Tens of thousands of people, masked and unmasked, have thronged the streets of Minneapolis, Atlanta, Louisville, Ky., and other cities in the week since George Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. They are the largest public gatherings in the U.S. since the pandemic forced widespread shutdowns, and many local officials warned of a possible spike in new cases in one or two weeks. ""Risk of transmission is lower in open spaces, but wherever there is a gathering there is still the risk of transmitting the virus,"" said Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. Health experts urged protesters not to sing and shout to reduce the threat of person-to-person transmission. And they cautioned that police tactics such as tear gas and pepper spray could exacerbate the situation by prompting people to cough and gasp for air. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a list of tips for demonstrators to lower their risk of contracting COVID-19, such as covering their faces and staying in small groups. ""Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead,"" the department advised. Nsoesie said that while she agrees with the sentiment, ""I can see how some of these tips can be difficult to follow. For example, if you are angry or frustrated about an issue, you want to express that feeling, and speaking is one way of doing that."" She added, ""It's also hard to keep 6 feet of distance at a protest."" Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she's worried about how consecutive days of protests could trigger an influx of COVID-19 cases. Huge demonstrations began in the nation's capital on Friday — the same day Bowser lifted stay-at-home orders and eased shutdown rules. The city is still limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people. But in the streets around the White House, that cap is regularly exceeded by orders of magnitude. ""I'm so concerned about it that I'm urging everybody to consider their exposure if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested, because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve,"" Bowser said on NBC's Meet the Press. But the risks of congregating during a global pandemic shouldn't keep people from protesting racism, according to dozens of public health and disease experts who signed an open letter in support of the protests. ""White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,"" the letter said. Initially written by infectious disease experts at the University of Washington, the letter cited a number of systemic problems, from the disproportionately high rate at which black people have been killed by police in the U.S. to disparities in life expectancy and other vital categories — including black Americans' higher death rate from the coronavirus. ""Data is showing that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in many states,"" said Nsoesie, who was not among the letter's signatories when NPR contacted her. ""Racism is one of the reasons this disparity exists."" She continued, ""Racism is a social determinant of health. It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn't weigh these crises separately."" Local governments should not break up crowded demonstrations ""under the guise of maintaining public health,"" the experts said in their open letter. They urged law enforcement agencies not to use tear gas, smoke and other irritants, saying they could make people more susceptible to infection and worsen existing health conditions. The medical professionals also acknowledged the potential for COVID-19 cases to rise in the days to come, and they called for public health agencies to boost access to care and testing in affected communities.

As one of the oldest black-owned businesses in Richmond, four generations of the Waller family have seen the city through its ups and downs. The recent Richmond protests is another chapter in their history that saw looters break-in and steal. “After we were vandalized on Friday night, Saturday night I came out here and I stood to protect my family’s legacy,” said Leonetty Gray, Richard’s niece. “I stood out in front of that building for three and a half hours to protect that building until I no longer personally felt safe and I felt like something could happen to me.” Once she left, the looting began. “Very unfortunate due to the positive effects of people trying to protest,” said David Waller, owner and manager. “Some people who didn’t have good intentions decided to use this opportunity to do break-ins and break glass and be violent.” But in times of trouble the good also comes out in Richmond as local fraternities and sororities came together to help repair the store. “It was great,” said Waller, Jr. “We had people, 100 kids that were out front yesterday.” “It filled my heart. It filled my spirit.,” added Gray, who says she is thankful for everyone that helped. “I really truly don’t even have the words.” The Divine Nine “We are about community service,” said Samantha Thompson, member of The Divine Nine group who helped Waller & Company Jewelers. “That’s the foundation of our organizations, black Greek letter organizations.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) NEW YORK – The nation's unrest has made for an unprecedented nightly action show on television, with control rooms that switch quickly between cars ablaze, police officers advancing on demonstrators and ransacked stores in cities across the country. What's easy to get lost are peaceful protesters concerned about police treatment of minorities — the raw wound reopened by George Floyd's death. Floyd's brother, Terrence, publicly asked Monday for those people outraged by how George died last week after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee to his brother's neck to make their feelings known peacefully. That's daytime television, however. When darkness falls and prime-time television begins, earnest activism is replaced by tense scenes of conflict unique in their breadth. Scenes of urban unrest have been visible before in the nation's history — the 1968 riots were more frightening and deadly — but not in so many cities at the same time, with so many cameras to observe. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton said Monday that he's worried about a backlash caused by the attention paid to violent demonstrations. “If you only display that, in this whole ‘if it bleeds, it leads’ media obsession, than in many ways you are hurting George Floyd all over again,” said Sharpton, an MSNBC host. “Because he becomes a side story to the tragedy of what happened and to the pursuit of justice.” What's happening in the cities need to be covered, but not at the expense of losing Floyd, he said. What appeared live on CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC the last few nights was gripping and absorbing. In Washington, people stood holding cell phone cameras above their heads Sunday night, capturing flames shooting in the air, the way they would at a concert in more peaceful times. MSNBC's Garrett Haake walked through the streets reporting live and viewers could see what perhaps he couldn't: police officers waving at him to get away. Suddenly, bang! And an expletive. Haake had been hit by a rubber bullet. He kept trying to talk but his crew had separated, and anchor Katy Tur told him to find a safe refuge. Switch to CNN and reporter Shimon Prokupecz is in New York's Union Square, watching a roiling crowd in a tense standoff with police. He's almost trampled when people suddenly run in his direction. In Santa Monica, California, MSNBC's Gadi Schwartz is in an outdoor mall, watching people stream out of a sporting goods store, carrying as much plundered merchandise as they could hold. A police siren wails nearby, and everyone scatters. Networks have done strong work covering demonstrations and speaking to peaceful protesters during the day, but what comes later is hard to compete with, said Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. “The dominant pictures in 2020, as it was in 1968, are of fire and looting,” said veteran journalist Dan Rather, who reported for CBS News during the rioting 52 years ago. “That skews the coverage, as it did in 1968. It gives the impression that the whole country is in collapse. But the whole country is not in collapse. The whole country is not in flames.” The challenge for journalists is to continue covering what prompted the demonstrations and the violence, he said. “That gets lost in a newscast that goes from city to city, and scenes of looting or violence,” Rather said. “That's part of the story. But the core of the story is why is this happening? What's this all about?” CNN, which celebrates its 40th anniversary this week, wasn't around in 1968. Neither were Fox or MSNBC. Live coverage of rioting was rare. For one thing, television crews usually had to carry large, clunky cameras and race back to the office to have film processed. Even during the 1994 Rodney King riots in Los Angeles, the dominant image was somewhat removed: a helicopter shot of a driver being pulled from his truck and beaten. Portable, lightweight equipment now permits journalists to get in the middle of the action. Rather was memorably manhandled while reporting at the raucous Democratic convention in Chicago in 1968. That's mild compared to what happened this weekend. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is investigating a stunning 78 reported cases of physical attacks on journalists over the past three days, in at least 25 different cities. In many cases, journalists made it clear to authorities that they were members of the press, and were attacked anyway, said Kirstin McCudden, managing editor of the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. It's one reason why Sally Buzbee, executive editor at The Associated Press, stressed safety to the company's news managers in an internal call on Monday morning.",0.0

Photo by Joel Smith At 3:30 a.m. Sunday, May 30, Greg Milefsky stood in the middle of his store, Balance Bicycle Shop, on Richmond’s West Broad Street. The windows were broken, and the bikes — those for sale and ones left by customers for repair — were all gone. “People were coming in and stealing everything that was left,” Milefsky said Monday. “I unplugged my server and computer and left the way I came, through the broken window.” Balance Bicycle Shop has been in business eight years at its location near Virginia Commonwealth University. In the early hours of Sunday, it was ground zero for some of the worst civil unrest Richmond has seen in decades. In downtown Richmond, in an eclectic, mostly local arts-focused business district, protests prompted by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned violent Friday and Saturday night. Police were out in force, setting off canisters of tear gas and using pepper spray, while some in the crowds of protesters tagged buildings and windows with spray paint, busted in windows, looted stores and set fires. More than 230 people were arrested Sunday after a citywide 8 p.m. curfew went into effect. Gov. Ralph Northam called a state of emergency, and other Virginia cities and counties saw smaller protests, many of which were peaceful. Virginia Beach and Fredericksburg saw protests turn violent, and the city of Lynchburg set a voluntary 8 p.m. curfew Monday. On Friday, a police car was torched in front of the Richmond Police Department office on Grace Street and a GRTC Transit System Pulse bus was set on fire in the middle of West Broad Street. The bus cost approximately $470,000, a GRTC spokeswoman said, and the driver had to get out after “protesters surrounded and started swarming the bus. There was no clear option for the driver to move the bus without endangering the lives of protesters.” To the west, Confederate monuments on Monument Avenue were spray-painted with slogans decrying the police and white supremacy. By Saturday night, minor damage such as graffiti tags had progressed to fires set in the streets, and then came extensive property damage, including a couple of small structure fires and looting of stores on Broad Street. Many affected businesses had only recently reopened after shutdown orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By 11 p.m. Saturday, Milefsky said, “it became obvious I was going to be looted. You could see the progression down to the shop.” Nearby Kroger and Rite-Aid stores were “absolutely decimated,” he said, and other businesses around his store were damaged. People were smashing in windows with bricks and cobblestones, added Gordon Stettinius, owner of Candela’s Books + Gallery, further east on Broad. He spoke to people who were there — fellow business owners included — in the aftermath, as he and a crew of friends and colleagues boarded up the gallery Sunday and moved valuable pieces of art elsewhere. City Councilor Kim Gray and her daughter were on the scene “when it went sideways” around 1 a.m. Sunday, Stettinius said. Gray, who is running for mayor, took cobblestones out of people’s hands, he said. “The reason I have windows is directly because of Kim Gray. She was tamping down the madness somewhat.” A Virginia ABC store was broken into and looted that night, and Stettinius said a fellow gallery owner saw “a white dude with a sledgehammer” smashing a window at Corporate & Museum Frame, another store on Broad. Paul Trible, co-founder and CEO of Ledbury, checked on his downtown Broad Street store during the day Saturday, after the first night of violent protests. “But then Saturday night — we were not down there, but we got a call from one of our neighbors around 10:45 or so that someone had thrown a brick and broken the windows [at the neighbor’s store].” Trible watched on Twitter a video of “someone jumping out of our store window with a handful of shirts, and actually two people who were there at the protest told people not to loot and take things. They actually followed this guy, ran after him down into Jackson Ward, like, ‘What are you doing? That’s not what this is about.’ We have that footage.” Jasmine Jahangiri, whose father opened Coliseum Deli 17 years ago in the midst of VCU’s campus, said a large window at their deli was broken after they had closed for the night. Looters “stole cash and soda, sprayed sodas everywhere. They stole some gum and candy, which makes me think they’re kids.” A volunteer said he’d paint a mural on the board covering the broken window, she said. “We understand the protests,” Jahangiri said of herself and her parents, who emigrated to the United States from Iran. “I personally think the peaceful protests are the way to change, [but] people deserve to be angry. It makes me mad.” Over on nearby Grace Street, the 120-year-old Waller & Co. Jewelry store — owned by a black family for generations — was also broken into, with watches and men’s jewelry items stolen. A group of volunteers from black sororities and fraternities at Virginia Union University and VCU helped repair damage and bought some of the store’s Greek organization merchandise over the weekend. Others helped set up a GoFundMe page to defray expenses, although the store is covered by insurance. Waller & Co. had just reopened the shop Friday after being closed for two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. Leonetty Gray, whose grandfather opened the store in 1900, stood in front of the shop Saturday night for more than three hours trying to protect it, until she felt unsafe and went home. “It was definitely very scary, but I was not going to let them destroy my family’s legacy.” She and her mother, Betty Waller, are the third and fourth generations of Wallers to work in the store, which is now owned by Betty Waller’s brother, Richard. The family is determined to reopen after the curfew is lifted and it is safe again. “We’re going to persevere,” Betty Waller said. Preparing for the worst After the ABC store on West Broad Street was looted late Saturday, that location and eight other ABC stores in the city were boarded up, said Taylor Thornberg, a spokesperson for the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority. Twenty other ABC stores are closing an hour early at 6 p.m., and ABC is working with local law enforcement on plans to close other stores early. In Richmond’s Carytown shopping district, which is a couple of miles southwest from the heaviest protests, three stores were broken into over the weekend. Many merchants were taking precautions Monday, with a protest march scheduled for 5 p.m. on Main Street, a block from Carytown. Store owners were less worried about the march, which is likely to be over before Richmond’s 8 p.m. curfew, but were concerned about the possibility of violence later in the night. Cary Court shopping center was about to be entirely boarded up, as workers hired by property management company Sauer Properties Inc. came bearing planks of wood and tools. In the shopping center, Schwarzschild Jewelers was broken into, and two of its display cases were draped with cloth Monday. Police are investigating, said Kiley Schiffman Storrs, director of marketing for Schiffman’s Jewelers, which owns Schwarzschild’s four stores in Richmond and Charlottesville. “We completely believe in everyone’s right to free speech,” said Storrs, who is based in North Carolina. “For us, the vandalism is a bit of a shock.” Down the street, the clothing, shoe and housewares shop Need Supply Co. was protected by plywood and locked after it too was broken into late Saturday, and many other stores and restaurants were boarded up or in the process of doing so. Others placed signs in the windows saying “Black Lives Matter” and “Locally Owned,” hoping for the best. Several merchants said they agree wholeheartedly with the views of protesters, many of whom say they are marching not only on Floyd’s behalf but for all unarmed black people who have been killed by police. The 2018 killing of Marcus-David Peters, a 24-year-old teacher who was shot by a Richmond police officer who was not charged, is still a source of deep community pain and anger. ‘A perfect storm’ Lisa McSherry owns two shops — Mamie’s Apothecary, a months-old bath and cosmetics shop, and the 24-year-old formal dress boutique Lex’s of Carytown. She didn’t plan to board up her windows, which can be expensive for small businesses. The break-ins in Carytown were “very targeted and very criminal,” she said, and seemed more calculated than the damage done on Broad. Between the pandemic, Richmond’s two-week delay of Phase One of the governor’s reopening plan, and the protests, “it’s just a perfect storm” for small business owners, McSherry said. She, too, supports the aim of the protests, but added, “I wish it were more peaceful. The daytime ones have appeared to be calm. Nighttime comes and it’s a different vibe.” Jim Bland, owner of Plan 9 Records, removed most signs and merchandise away from his windows but had not decided to board them up on Monday afternoon. The music store had just reopened, and Bland had begun bringing his employees back to work after closing in mid-March. “It depends on what we hear during the day,” he said of the possibility of putting up plywood sheets. “I hate the message that it sends.” Christopher Turner, who has sold flower arrangements both online and outside Can Can Brasserie in Carytown for eight years, also takes a broad view of the situation. “Some people stole some stuff from me Sunday,” he said Monday. “Life is more important than money, but I do want to make my money.” The owners all say that they’re thankful for the help of their customers, their friends and family members, even strangers who showed up to sweep, nail plywood to protect their businesses, and those who have made donations in the wake of the violence. Milefsky started a GoFundMe page even though he didn’t want to, “because there were so many people that said they were going to do it for me.” The money, he said, is first going to pay back his customers for their stolen bikes and then to “keep my employees paid.” He also plans to rebuild, but not in Richmond. He says there’s bound to be more killings in the future and more protests, potentially followed by looting and other damage. “I can’t spend six months rebuilding my business, only for it to be looted again,” Milefsky said. “I will be looking in Henrico, Hanover, Chesterfield to rebuild.” Here are fundraising pages for other locally owned businesses damaged in Richmond: Experimax of Richmond Rumors Boutique The Tech Exchange Richmond Black Restaurant Experience, supporting restaurant owners affected by the pandemic Assistant Editor Sydney Lake contributed to this story.

(Max Gersh/The Courier Journal via AP) LOUISVILLE, Ky. – Riot police firing tear gas scattered a protest crowd from a downtown Louisville square Monday night, hours after the firing of the city's police chief in the uproar over the early morning shooting death of a popular restaurant owner by security forces. David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue spot who was known for offering meals to police officers, died while police and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew early Monday amid waves of protests over a previous police shooting in Kentucky’s largest city. Police said they were responding to gunfire from a crowd. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced the firing of Police Chief Steve Conrad at a news conference Monday. He said officers involved in the shooting failed to activate body cameras at the chaotic scene. Authorities had sought footage for their investigation, after Kentucky’s governor demanded the release of police video. “This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,” Fischer said. “Accordingly, I have relieved Steve Conrad of his duties as chief of Louisville Metro Police Department.” Gov. Andy Beshear later called the lack of body camera footage unacceptable. “This is the entire reason that we have those cameras,” the Democratic governor said at the state Capitol in Frankfort. Beshear authorized state police to independently investigate, promising the probe will be conducted in an “honest and transparent way that will not take months.” U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman announced that federal authorities will be part of the investigation. The governor said he had counted on body camera footage to help determine “the truth in a way that spoke for itself, at a time when trust is difficult and people deserve to be able to see and evaluate.” Late Monday afternoon, a huge group stretching several city blocks marched peacefully from downtown Louisville to the spot where McAtee was shot. Some motorists honked horns and raised fists in solidarity. Hundreds of protesters regrouped later Monday night at downtown Jefferson Square and riot police standing shoulder to shoulder advanced amid burts of fired tear gas, dispersing the crowd. Military-style vehicles could later be seen occupying the emptied-out square. The shakeup at the top of the city's police department came a month earlier than expected. Conrad had previously announced his resignation, which was to take effect at the end of June. Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder will step in immediately as chief, Fischer said. The mayor also said the city's curfew was being extended until June 8. Police did retrieve video from crime center cameras that showed how the shooting unfolded, Schroeder said. Two Louisville officers and two Guard soldiers returned fire, he said. The two officers violated policy by not wearing or activating body cameras, Schroeder said, adding they have been placed on administrative leave. McAtee, whose YaYa's BBQ Shack is near where the shooting occurred, was mourned by hundreds. Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist and executive director of the group Game Changers, said McAtee was well-liked. “I’ve never known him to be aggressive in any kind of way,” he said. Schroeder agreed that McAtee was friendly to police officers. “Over the years he’s been a good friend to the police officers ... frequently making sure our officers had a good meal on their shifts,"" he said. Before his dismissal, Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. Monday outside a food market on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a group of curfew violators. Someone fired a shot at law enforcement officials, and both soldiers and officers returned fire, he said. Several “persons of interest” were being interviewed, he said. News outlets showed video taken by someone in a car parked at a gas station. It recorded the sound of bullets being fired as groups of police and Guard soldiers crouched behind cars. Kris Smith said he was at a restaurant — “just outside having a good time, having drinks, eating barbecue” — when the soldiers arrived. “As soon as I walk to my car they jump out with the sticks, the police jump out with their sticks and their shields and stuff on,"" Smith said. “It looked like something out of a movie. It looked like a freaking war zone.” He said he heard a loud noise, then gunfire minutes later. Smith, who is black, said the group had nothing to do with the protests. Protesters have been demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home. After Taylor's death, the mayor said Louisville police would be required to wear body cameras. ___ Associated Press contributors include Claire Galofaro and Rebecca Reynolds Yonker in Louisville.

Floyd died in police custody on Memorial Day in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis) SAN DIEGO – Carrying brooms, shovels, trash bags and cans of paint, thousands of people from Los Angeles to New York swept up glass from broken store windows, covered over graffiti and organized ransacked businesses Monday after protests over police killings of black people turned destructive once again. Some showed up only hours after taking part in demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, a black man pinned to the ground by a white Minneapolis police officer who pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes. Many said cleaning felt cathartic during a dark period for a nation battling the coronavirus pandemic, the job losses that followed and now the worst racial unrest in half a century. Bill Stuehler donned a mask Sunday and marched with a fellow nurse and other activists in Los Angeles, later trying to stop young people from breaking into stores and stealing. At home, he kept watching the violence on live feeds and fell deeper into despair. So before sunrise, the 66-year-old grabbed brooms, a rake and a trash shovel and drove to nearby Long Beach to clean up the mess. Soon, more than 2,000 people were working side by side, scrubbing, filling trash containers and repairing what they could in the hard-hit city south of Los Angeles. “It was pretty amazing to see the number of people turn out for the community,” Stuehler said. “It restored the faith in humanity that I had lost last night.” Throngs of people nationwide volunteered to help businesses — from small shops to major chains — bounce back from the damage, though some stores had burned to the ground and another night of unrest was expected. In New Jersey, Chris DeLeon, broom in hand, arrived at 8 a.m. with dozens of other people to sweep up broken glass in the capital of Trenton. The 34-year-old had protested Sunday, then decided to help clean up after seeing videos of people smashing windows. “It just goes to show there’s at least as many good people as there are other folks out there,” DeLeon said. In Wisconsin, volunteers in Milwaukee and Madison turned up for a second day to clean up damage from the night before. Countless businesses already had taken a hit from restrictions designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus and were starting to reopen just as the protests led to more expensive setbacks: vandalism and stolen merchandise. The owner of the Laugh Factory’s club in Long Beach discovered broken windows and doors, computers smashed and memorabilia stolen, including Three Stooges posters and autographed photos of Redd Foxx and other late comedians. Workers boarded up windows and swept up broken glass Monday. Owner Jamie Masada was offering an unspecified reward to anyone who returns the memorabilia. “It is not worth anything to them but it means a lot to me,” Masada said, because it's tied to those who represent “the height of comedy.’” In Sacramento, two-thirds of the capital city's 600 downtown properties took a hit, with more than 200 broken windows, 330 pieces of graffiti, and more than 50 cases of “significant property damage,"" said Michael Ault, executive director of the Downtown Sacramento Partnership. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said she didn't recognize downtown when she walked through it Sunday, “but what I did recognize were the hundreds of volunteers and residents who came because they love Seattle.” Stuehler found the same community spirit in Long Beach. A nurse who had been treating COVID-19 patients, Stuehler took the month off when he joined the protest. He said a small percentage of people vandalized businesses but “the horror of the opportunism, the rage, the disregard for logic and reason — it was shocking.” They had an outsize impact that detracts from the message of overhauling police agencies, Stuehler said. But he said he's feeling revived after seeing so many people work together. Alycia Barber also was moved to help after watching from her Long Beach apartment as people smashed windows and police doused the crowds with pepper spray Sunday. The 22-year-old got up early and joined others organizing clothing and jewelry strewn inside a Forever 21 store, hours after thieves made off with armloads of merchandise. Few of the volunteers knew each other; they just showed up, she said. There were parents with children, senior citizens, college students. One woman brought paint and brooms so people could paint over graffiti on the outside wall of a parking garage. “I just feel so helpful today,"" Barber said, adding that she supports the fight against racial injustice. “But now we also want to get up and make the world a beautiful place for people."" ___ Watson reported from San Diego.

(WRIC) — Following a violent weekend, many Richmond businesses that were vandalized and looted began the rebuilding process Monday. Surveillance cameras caught many looters in the act. Griffin Vape, located on W. Broad Street, was one of the many businesses that fell victim to violent rioters. “I woke up to the alarm company calling me and they said there’s activity happening in your store,” said Griffin Vape store owner Adam Sanabani. Security cameras from inside the business show looters breaking the glass door, storming into the shop and stealing merchandise early Sunday morning. Sanabani adds that the cash register was emptied. “I tapped into the cameras and it was just a free for all, 7 or 8 people in there just taking as much as they can, running out, and rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat,” Sanabani said. The store’s security company called the police but they did not respond. According to Sanabani, one of his employees came by and fought off the looters. “He managed to get everybody out and then flip a big table over just to kind of cover the door,” he said. But the damage had already been done. Griffin Vape was just one of many businesses in the Richmond area that were either burglarized, robbed, or torched during protests that turned into riots over the weekend. The outrage stems from the incidents that led to the death of George Floyd, who is seen on video restrained by police officers, with one officer kneeling on his neck for several minutes in Minnesota. Griffin Vape is staying open, but Sanabani boarded up the windows to further protect the business. On Monday, two men asked Sanabani if they could spray paint the name of George Floyd on the boards and Sanabani obliged. Griffin Vape has windows boarded up after it was looted Sunday. Two men asked the owner for permission to spraypaint “George Floyd” on the boards.

Her business was not robbed, but there is a large crack in the front window from the heat of a nearby fire that was set in the street. Out of caution, Jackson packed up and moved her valuable items to storage on Monday. “I need to protect my stuff so I just feel like I take my stuff and put it in storage and whatever happens, happens cause I don’t know where to go next,” Jackson said. “I have no answers, I don’t know what to do, it’s been hard, it’s been difficult.” LATEST HEADLINES:",0.0

California Democrat Barbara Lee is condemning the looting and destruction. “We can not allow negative aspects…to overshadow why people in this country are protesting,” Representative Barbara Lee, D-California, said. But Lee wants all Americans to acknowledge the pain and injustice that sparked the demonstrations in the name of George Floyd. “People throughout the country have said enough is enough, saying we’re not going to allow police murders to go on any further,” Lee said. Norma Torres says institutional racism is embedded in our history. “I’m not sure we’re ever able to eradicate it,” Representative Norma Torres, D-California, said. She says while it may be hard to see now, political activism and peaceful protest have made a difference. “It’s important to recognize, a lot of change has happened,” Torres said.

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

The chief said the police cruiser was being swarmed by a group that began attacking it Sunday in downtown Los Angeles. “That unit, in an effort to leave that area, took evasive action and in the course of that, struck an individual or more than one individual and fled that area,” he said. Video showed the cruiser accelerating forward and knocking at least two people to the ground before reversing, turning swiftly and driving off as a group hurled objects at the vehicle. “The people who want us to do something different, what would they have us do?” the chief said. “Have the officers remain there? We’ve seen what’s happened to those vehicles. We’ve seen the smashed windshields, we’ve seen the vehicle set on fire, we had an MTA bus just three days ago that was set aflame.” Moore apologized to those hit by the cruiser, but told them, “you cannot attack a police officer. You cannot attack the very essence of our system of government, and be injured in the process, and then claim that that those police officers’ actions were wrong.” The department had released a statement Sunday saying the incident is under investigation. Over the weekend, largely peaceful protests were followed by looting, fires and clashes between officers and protestors that saw bricks and bottles thrown at officers and rubber bullets fired at protestors. “It was anarchy,” Moore said. On Sunday, nearly 700 people were arrested across the city. Nearly 400 were taken into custody the day before, and another 500 the day before that, the chief said. The U.S. National Guard moved in Sunday, arriving in downtown L.A. and Santa Monica ahead of officials enacting curfews. Moore acknowledged the measures don’t help dialogue. “The mechanisms that we’re having to resort to — nighttime curfews and National Guard mobilization of our resources and deployment of having resorting to forces necessary to restore order— those are things that are toxic to relationships of trust,” he said. He said that while there were thousands of protesters who have been involved in the violence in the city, there have been tens of thousands who haven’t been. “We all recognize that the vast majority that have been out there, feel hurt, and they’re angry they’re upset, and they feel like they they’re not having a voice,” he said. The police chief called on organizers of the protests to take responsibility for those he says are hijacking messages by looting and attacking officers. “I continue to extend an olive branch to Black Lives Matter. I’ve yet to have them take me up on that conversation,” he said. “And yeah, I recognize that they may not feel that that’s legitimate or I have any standing in this conversation, but as protest groups and as organizers, they need to step into this and take responsibility, more than just distancing themselves from those that are trying to hijack this.” In response, Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors told KTLA that though the “olive branch” is kind, conversation isn’t enough, and officials know what they need to do. “Conversations aren’t enough,” she said. “A conversation didn’t stop George Floyd from dying … And what we need is structural change, and that looks like a defunding of local law enforcement, it looks like holding lots of cops accountable, and it looks like really seeing these protesters as people who have righteous rage who also want change.” She had a message for the police chief: “When you tell me that you want to meet with me and at the same time, I’m witnessing your law enforcement officers rubber bullet and tear gas our community members, that’s not actually wanting to meet with me,” she said. “That’s just putting a bandaid over decades long of pain.”",0.0

(WRIC) — The weekend’s unrest in the city of Richmond has sparked a lot of conversation, emotion and questions. With many needing a space to vent, heal and address their views on racial inequality, local radio hosts provided an outlet Monday morning over the airwaves. DJ King Tutt and Clovia Lawrence, otherwise known as Community Clo, both host their own shows on 99.3 and 105.7 KISS FM at Radio One. Together they both ‘paused for the cause’, turning down the music to turn up the candid conversation. Tutt started the ‘Radio One Real Talk’ at 10 a.m. in the studio saying, “What is going on? I’ll tell you what, the city is just in despair, confusion, and anger.” Over the weekend, peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd and police brutality turned into riots in the city of Richmond and across the nation. Tutt shared his take on the airways stating, “We watched a black man with allegedly a fake $20 dollar bill die at the hands of police. Listen, there are other people in this world who are not colored skinned that have shot up schools, shot up malls, churches–killing multiple people. They are arrested and they have their day in court. Yet a brown colored person can be accused of jaywalking and end up dead.” Tutt and Clovia, like many, voiced their pain, anger, and frustration, but say the overall message is being hijacked. The city of Richmond was comparable to a war zone over the weekend with vehicles set on fire, businesses looted, windows smashed and buildings vandalized. “If you are out vandalizing, if you are out burning, you’re no better than the bad police who are killing innocent people,” Tutt scolded. He and Clovia encouraged listeners to call in and voice what they’re feeling or share anything on their heart. One call voiced, “What does a liquor store have to do with protesting? What does a clothing store have to do with protesting?” Another caller said, ” I would like to see more community liaisons. Not everybody knows the right way to protest. The black race is a special race because we’ve been oppressed for so long.” Special guests were also invited to call-in throughout the show. Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney joined the conversation. “We should all be appalled,” Stoney said. “That pain is real and that pain is raw. That is why you’re seeing frustration in the streets and that’s playing out in the streets. We still haven’t healed properly as a nation or here as a city.” Stoney also talked about needing a national leader in office who sends the right message during trying times. Jim Herring, a resident, called in and told the public he is a Trump supporter and George Floyd was murdered after being crushed to death. Herring said we need solutions and conversations, not riots. When asked by Clovia if Trump’s language on Twitter is dividing the nation, Herring said he believes Trump is not pulling people apart and he himself wouldn’t have used that language, but our President is human and everyone makes mistakes. Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor dialed-in, advising all people to evoke change by getting out and voting, saying “many have reached a breaking point”. Tutt and Clovia ended their special broadcast urging people to peacefully assemble and to report any illegal looting or vandalizing. LATEST HEADLINES:",0.0

The demonstration started as a corner protest on Main Street and College Avenue just before noon. The crowd soon moved down the street to the Blacksburg Police Department, where they silently kneeled for nine minutes in honor of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. From there, the protest went back through downtown and through Virginia Tech before returning to the police station. The crowd then listened to various speakers before dispersing at about 3 p.m. Protester Anthony Lovelace felt it was his duty to show up for the demonstration. “We’re not going to stop until we actually see a change.

""If we can all come together and have this big conclusion where amendments, laws and changes start to happen, that’s what I want.” Blacksburg police officers were present and in uniform at the rally, but they were not at the forefront.

Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One — Derek Chauvin — has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits."" : 6/03/20 A previous version of this Web story incorrectly said all four police officers present at the death of George Floyd are white. Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. AILSA CHANG, HOST: The viral video that sparked nationwide protests this weekend captured an individual tragedy - the death of a black man at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. But George Floyd's death is set against a backdrop of economic inequality that has long shadowed race relations in this country. We're going to talk about that now for a few minutes with NPR's Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So we've been hearing an enormous amount of frustration in the last week about yet another black man dying in police custody. Can you just break down for us how economics plays into that frustration? HORSLEY: There is certainly frustration with the deadly tactics of police. But there's also frustration about the underlying circumstances that in the richest country on Earth, a man could lose his life because he's suspected of passing a counterfeit 20-dollar bill. We know that African Americans are worse off than whites in this country by almost every economic measure. Andre Perry, who studies race and inequality at the Brookings Institution, says that means blacks in general are more vulnerable to any kind of economic downturn. ANDRE PERRY: Black folk live in communities where a single economic shock can really send the entire economic hopes astray. HORSLEY: And, of course, right now, we're all living through a giant economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. CHANG: Right. HORSLEY: People throughout the country are on edge. And that has just added more dry kindling to the woodpile where this match has landed. CHANG: Well, about the pandemic - I mean, we know that African Americans have suffered disproportionate health problems during this entire outbreak. But economically, how are they faring, relatively speaking, during this time? HORSLEY: Not well. Of course, workers of all races have seen a spike in unemployment during the pandemic. The black unemployment rate has jumped into double digits, as have other rates. But the black-white gap hasn't gotten noticeably worse during the last couple of months. CHANG: Interesting. HORSLEY: We do know, however, African Americans who are working are more likely to be in essential frontline jobs. And that puts them at greater risk of infection. CHANG: So how does Minneapolis, where this all started, stack up when it comes to inequality or when it comes to discrimination? HORSLEY: The racial divide in Minneapolis is pretty stark both in terms of income and homeownership. In fact, the gap between white and black homeownership in Minneapolis is one of the largest in the country. And that matters because for a lot of families, owning a home is the main building block of wealth and stability. If blacks aren't able to buy homes, they're missing out on an important stepping stone. Nationwide, African Americans did make some gains in homeownership in the '90s and early 2000s. But those were really wiped out by the subprime mortgage crisis. And Andre Perry says that kind of structural inequality feeds into the frustration of the people who are protesting George Floyd's death. PERRY: That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters. It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities. HORSLEY: Now, Perry notes these demonstrations are taking place five months before a national election. And he says this is a good opportunity for policymakers to talk about how they see policing and how they would address these longstanding economic challenges. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

Declaring himself ""the president of law and order,"" Trump said during a Rose Garden address that he is dispatching “thousands and thousands” of military personnel and law enforcement personnel to Washington, D.C., to stop rioting, looting, vandalism and destruction of property. Trump also urged governors to use as many National Guard troops as possible to control violence and warned if they didn't, he would deploy the U.S. military ""and quickly solve the problem for them."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protest,"" Trump said of the unrest. ""These are acts of domestic terror."" Immediately after his remarks, Trump walked across nearby Lafayette Park and visited St. John's Church, which was set on fire by protesters Sunday night. Trump held up a Bible in front of the boarded-up church, which is referred to as the ""church of presidents."" St. John's was built in 1815 and has been attended at least once by every president since James Madison. Trump's actions come after six days of protests and riots in cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died last week while in police custody. Police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Just minutes before Trump spoke in the Rose Garden and headed to St. John's, law enforcement officers cleared Lafayette Park with tear gas, rubber bullets, shields and horses. Though the Rose Garden was not within view of the protesters, reporters awaiting Trump’s speech reported hearing a series of loud booms. Critics suggested the decision to clear the park was linked to Trump's visit to the church. ""Were thousands of peaceful protestors just tear gassed so Trump could have a photo op?"" tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, a communications director for former President Barack Obama. Rabbi Jack Moline, president of Interfaith Alliance, also slammed Trump's visit to St. John's as a ""photo opp."" ""Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice – right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area – is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,"" he said. ""This only underscores the president’s complete lack of compassion for black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism."" Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump developed a plan to provide more federal help to cities dealing with the unrest during meetings with Attorney General William Barr, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley. ""There will be additional federal assets deployed across the nation,"" she said. ""There will be a central command center in conjunction with the state and local governments."" Trump is also considering invoking the Insurrection Act, an 1807 federal law that would allow him to deploy active-duty U.S. troops to respond to protests in cities. It was last invoked in 1992 for the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. Trump made the announcement hours after urging governors to accept federal help. The president told the state executives that most of them have been ""weak"" in failing to confront violent demonstrators. ""You have to dominate,"" he said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by CBS News. ""If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate."" McEnany later said the focus of the call ""was the National Guard, encouraging deployment far more than the 17,000 out there and utilizing them this evening certainly."" More:'Most of you are weak': Trump rails at the nation's governors, urges crackdown on violence More:'Nowhere to be found': Governors blast Trump after he tells them they are 'weak' on phone call Some governors criticized Trump's criticism, with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, describing his comments as ""deeply disturbing."" ""The president repeatedly and viciously attacked governors, who are doing everything they can to keep the peace while fighting a once-in-a-generation global pandemic,"" Whitmer said in a statement. “The president’s dangerous comments should be gravely concerning to all Americans, because they send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division.""",0.0

It started with one woman, Stacy O'Hara, holding a single Black Lives Matter sign around 11:30 a.m. Sunday. She said she was eventually joined by another, then there were ten, then 20. She said by the evening there were over 100 people standing in the roundabout singing, chanting and protesting peacefully. When she noticed tensions started to rise after dark, she said she left the area. When she came back the next morning, the damage done to Fifth and Federal Station, as well as other nearby business, was not what she wanted to see. ""I teared up,"" O'hara said. ""It's sad that they feel like they have to resort to that. I'm sad for the people who were inside who felt scared for their lives. I'm sad for the people outside who felt scared for their lives."" Some people who stopped by Monday wondered why this popular downtown restaurant was the target of Sunday night's violence. Many claim it started with a tweet Jerry Falwell Jr. sent last week that erupted backlash for what many saw as a racist joke. The owner of Fifth and Federal, Josh Read, re-posted that tweet, adding he'd pass out the masks to his employees. Only he said he meant his comments to be a jab at Northam and was blind to the bigger picture. ""We dearly apologize,"" Read said. ""There was no racial intent. It was sincerely based on our frustration with the pandemic and everything that had been going on prior to this."" Fifth and Federal had also apologized on social media before Sunday, but both apologies came too late and his business now has broken windows and doors, as well as other significant property damage. Many onlookers drove by throughout Monday morning to see the damage for themselves. Elliott Clifton couldn't believe the quiet gathering he'd been a part of Sunday turned to people throwing bricks and rocks at businesses and at police. ""I got a text that things turned violent in Lynchburg, and I said, 'Wait, really? No way. It was very peaceful when I was there,'"" Clifton said. ""And so I was shocked. Literally, shocked. I said I didn't think it would go that way here."" He urged community members to do better. That's something Read is already trying to do himself as he spoke with several of his neighbors when they stopped by restaurant. ""We want to work with our community and become stronger so that it doesn't happen again and that we're better for it,"" Read said. And when asked if he was sorry, he said 'absolutely.' ""It was a mistake,"" he said quietly. ""It was a foolish mistake to ever have posted [that tweet]."" Two of the protesters we spoke with were at Black Lives Matter protest when it was still peaceful and left before things took a turn for the worse. Both were on the same side for freedom and equality, but they had two different reactions to the damage done to their community. ""No, not really,"" O'Hara said when we asked if she felt sorry for Read. ""I'll be honest, I don't. He knew what his tweet would make people feel."" But Clifton said he was disappointed people hadn't maintained peace in the midst of the anger and pain. ""I think we're better than that,"" he explained. ""I think we know how to protest. We know how to protest peacefully. We know how to say what we want to say without it going this way. People don't want to take you seriously if you're just going to turn to violence. If that's your only way of communicating, no one is going to want to communicate with you. You have to be able to bring about change in a way that's not violent."" Read spent much of Monday picking up the pieces of his business, one stone at a time. WDBJ7 asked what his plans are for his restaurant, if he even has plans to reopen, and he said, right now, he has no idea.

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. A young boy holds a ""Justice"" sign as he peers outside the window of a car passing protesters marching through downtown for a third night of unrest Sunday May 31, 2020, in Richmond, Va. Gov. Ralph Northam issued a curfew for this evening. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to ""dominate the streets,"" Trump said the U.S. military would step in to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" the president declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president ""used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" ""It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. ""Shameful."" Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they ""look like fools"" for not deploying even more National Guard troops. ""Most of you are weak,"" he said. He added: ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges ""when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate."" In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. ""Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

Protests continue here in the Shenandoah Valley, including a silent one Monday night in downtown Harrisonburg. The Harrisonburg Silent March gained support from thousands of people just 24 hours after an event was scheduled on Facebook. Maleke Jones, the organizer of the march, said he wanted people to come together to safely protest the death of Floyd and countless other people of color. He said the march will begin in Liberty Park, proceed to Hotel Madison, return back down Main St., past the Harrisonburg Police Department, and end back at Liberty Park. ""It feels good to see so many people try and support this movement, just because over the years it's been steadily growing, slowly but surely,"" Jones said. ""Just to see in less than 24 hours over 500 people are coming to this event, it's just amazing."" Jones said he decided to organize the silent march because after seeing protests around the country result in deaths, injuries, and arrests, he didn't want that to happen in Harrisonburg. ""Speak out about what's going on using signs and just following the movement,"" Jones said. ""If they were to be chanting and stuff like that, it could very easily get out of hand, and like I said, that's not what I want to happen here."" To ensure the march remains peaceful, Jones said there have been people placed throughout the crowd who will de-escalate any situations that could turn hateful or violent. ""They're just going to be strategically placed to make sure that no one gets out of hand, no one is engaging in provoking conversations with the cops, or anyone that's going to escalate the situation,"" Jones said. He said he is excited to see people come together for this silent march, but participants should remember that the protests happening in cities across the country are bigger than the death of Floyd.

But they took it to a place that we didn't see coming. It is the youth around the nation that feel the most violated. They feel it will only get worse. And I think this is a real loud cry for help.

Amid racial unrest across the nation, President Donald Trump on Monday declared himself “the president of law and order” and threatened to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the White House's idyllic Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Trump said he would mobilize “thousands and thousands"" of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park. The escalation came just after Attorney General William Barr came to the park to to survey the demonstrators. Minutes after his speech, Trump made a brief visit outside the 200-year-old church near the White House that was set on fire over the weeekend. Law enforcement cleared protesters out of the area with tear gas before Trump’s visit. Tear gas canisters could be heard exploding as Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. He then walked over to the church. The protesters appeared to be acting peacefully before they were dispersed by force. According to senior defense officials, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were being sent to Washington to provide assistance. Those troops were either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people. In extreme cases, however, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, also from the Civil War, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement. The officials said that some of the National Guard in D.C. will be armed and others will not. They said that the D.C. guard members do not have non-lethal weapons. The military police that are visible in the city are members of the Guard. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred in part by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. In a conference call Monday with the nation's governors. Trump berated most of them as “weak” for not cracking down harder on the lawlessness that has convulsed cities from coast to coast. A medical examiner on Monday classified George Floyd’s death as a homicide, saying his heart stopped as police restrained him and suppressed his neck, in a widely seen video that has sparked protests across the nation. An autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said Monday. A Minneapolis police officer has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, and three other officers were fired. Bystander video showed the officer, Derek Chauvin, holding his knee on Floyd’s neck despite the man's cries that he couldn't breathe until he eventually stopped moving.",0.0

Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency in Virginia Sunday in the wake of widespread unrest after Floyd’s death. Protests in several Virginia cities, including Richmond, the capital, turned violent over the weekend, with stores looted and fires set, and police using tear gas on protestors and making arrests. “This emergency declaration will provide the necessary support to localities as they work to keep our communities safe, Northam said in a press release, adding, “There are many voices speaking out for justice and healing across the United States and in our Commonwealth, but others are exploiting this pain and inciting violence.” “The Commonwealth of Virginia has experienced significant events in the past 48 hours that have required intervention to restore order, ensure the safety of protestors and the public, protect property, and provide additional resources to support our local and state partners. In the past 24 hours alone, there have been numerous instances of unlawful activity resulting in injuries to peaceful protestors and first responders, significant property damage, and continued escalation of violent events,” Executive Order 64 reads, in part. The order cites unlawful assemblies in Richmond, Prince William County, and Roanoke. In Richmond, damage included burning of two buildings, vehicle fires, dumpster fires, vandalism, looting, and damage to police vehicles. The order directs state and local governments “to render appropriate assistance to prepare for and respond to this situation.” The order activates the Virginia Emergency Operations Center and Emergency Support Team to coordinate assistance to state and local governments and activates the Virginia National Guard to active duty. It also authorizes up to $350,000 in state funds for state and local response to the emergency, including $250,000 for the Department of Military Affairs. The order also placed a curfew between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. in Richmond until June 3. The order is in effect until June 29 unless it is changed or rescinded. “I acknowledge each of the voices crying out for justice and healing across the United States and in our Commonwealth. I affirm the deep concerns from the black community. I hear you. I know your pain is real,” Northam wrote in a Facebook post Sunday morning, adding, “We have all seen too many people harassed, abused, and killed by law enforcement officers, in too many places, for too long—just for being black. I also know that others are exploiting this pain and are now causing violence.” Local Rallies Organized Local organizers this week announced rallies in Accomack County to protest Floyd’s death, including in Accomac and Chincoteague, as well as in Exmore in Northampton County. Shanyette Dickerson is among organizers of a peaceful protest planned for Saturday, June 6 at 2 p.m. at the courthouse green in Accomac. It is the first such event Dickerson and the others have organized. “I’m hoping to have a little more unity in our community,” Dickerson said in a telephone interview with the Post this week. She wants people to know “we’re here; we hear them. I have so many people who are just angry on Facebook…and they don’t have anywhere to put their anger, so I feel like this rally will definitely be a good, safe space for people to say their frustrations. It’s okay to be mad; we have a right to be angry.” Plans include motivational speakers and a moment of silence for those who have died as result of police brutality. The organizers decided to plan a protest on the Eastern Shore after attending an event in Norfolk last week. “It was such unity there, and it gave me a chance to be able to feel okay with expressing the anger and the hurt and the rage that I have with how we are as a nation,” said Taniqua West, another person involved in planning the event. Their hope is to bring awareness to issues surrounding racism and to start a conversation locally, they said. On Chincoteague, a rally for justice and equality was held at Donald J. Leonard Park Wednesday afternoon. Organizer Samantha Kelly, who was born and raised on Chincoteague — and who is white — is a Chincoteague High School graduate. She graduated in May from the University of Virginia with a double major in Sociology and Media Studies. Asked why she decided to organize a rally on Chincoteague, Kelly said Tuesday, “This is something that I’ve always been interested in — civil rights, women’s rights, gay rights — I’ve always been active in my community and trying to stand out and make a difference where I can.” “I have a lot of friends in Horntown, and a lot of black friends in Chincoteague, and I’ve made friends out in Charlottesville. I feel like the last few years with my education, my eyes have become more open than ever — and I feel like, if not me, then who?” Kelly said, adding, “…Why don’t we put Chincoteague on the map as an accepting and inclusive, diverse place that is tolerant?” The event, which remained peaceful, attracted around 120 people — a mix of young and old, black and white, many holding signs. The event kicked off with a prayer offered by the Rev. Lisa Marie Cropper Johnson, a graduate of Chincoteague High School, Class of 1984. “What this is about is peace and love; this is not about rioting; that is not what we are doing here. This is going to be a peaceful protest,” Kelly said. Kelly gave a brief speech, saying, “We all know how George Floyd died; we all know that this is only one of countless cases of unjust, race-based police brutality. It hurts us. We are grieving with our country. We are tired. We are tired of systematic racism. We are tired of our black brothers and sisters being discriminated against because of the color of their skin.” Kelly’s speech was followed by chants of “Black Lives Matter,” “Justice for George,” “Don’t Forget to Vote,” and other slogans, and then by nearly a dozen other speakers, after Kelly invited participants to take the microphone and say their piece. Chincoteague native Alyssa Hickman said of racism, “To people who call this home, we know how great it is here, how everybody treats everybody so great — but you know what? It’s here.” She recounted how her boyfriend, who is of mixed race, was called a derogatory name at a local restaurant, and how an employee at a Salisbury uniform shop accused him of stealing when he went to the store to purchase scrubs for his new job as a registered nurse. “So, long story short, guys — it is local…It happens all the time. The best thing we can do is just say something, call it out,” she said. Chincoteague resident Pat Farley, who recently ran for a seat on town council, thanked Kelly for organizing the rally. “There is more we can do to push this town to be more inclusive,to open up avenues of opportunity for everyone here,” she said. Aleda Frishman said she is a Chincoteaguer whose heritage on the island dates to the 1600s. “This matters; this matters,” she said, adding, “…Systemic racism runs through all of the systems in America…This matters, this peaceful protest matters. We have to keep going.” “We are having the rally here because we want Chincoteague’s name to be a bright, shining star on the map of all the cities supporting black rights across the U. S. We want Chincoteague to be known as a supportive, inclusive, and loving place…We want to start a conversation here,” Kelly said.",0.0

(Border Report) — Rioters vandalized and looted an entire strip mall over the weekend about 25 miles east of Downtown San Diego. It was just one of the countless riots that broke out nationwide in the wake of the protests that followed the alleged murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Just down the street, they burned two banks to the ground, only rubble and a crippled steel structure left behind. A Union and Chase bank were reduced to rubble by a fire set by looters over the weekend in La Mesa, CA. (Courtesy: Drone 5) The looting took place Saturday night, and one of the businesses hit was Steve Clay’s Postal Annex. “They went all the day down the line and damaged every business,” Clay said. “It was sickening just total and empty feeling in your stomach, this is your livelihood being destroyed.”  Looters used bats to break windows and doors to gain access to businesses in La Mesa, CA. (OnScene.TV/Special to Border Report) Clay has been in business for 17 years and never expected this to happen in his hometown of La Mesa. “You can have a protest, you can do it peacefully then go home, but don’t come after us,” Clay said. Clay was happy to see what happened in the aftermath as neighbors and total strangers showed up to help clean and board up damaged businesses.

(Salvador Rivera/Border Report) “People came out in the middle of the night and showed up with wood, I don’t even know where they came from, they put up all these planks all the way down,” said Clay. “Then the next day hundreds of people came and showed up took everything out of my business, cleaned everything out and vacuumed, they had snow shovels to get all the broken glass, and they put it back together.” There were other protests in the San Diego area over the weekend, but aside from a few confrontations with police, the demonstrations were fairly peaceful.

Protests were held throughout the country over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) NEW YORK (AP) — New York City imposed a late-night curfew Monday that failed to prevent another night of destruction, including arrests after a break-in at the iconic Macy’s store on 34th Street, following protests over George Floyd’s death. As the 11 p.m. deadline to get off the streets approached, bands of protesters marched peacefully through Manhattan and Brooklyn, but police simultaneously responded to numerous reports of roving groups of people smashing their way into shops and emptying them of merchandise. The doors of Macy’s flagship Manhattan store were breached. Police pulled two handcuffed men out and put them in a van. People rushed into a Nike store and carried out armloads of clothing. Near Rockefeller Center, storefront windows were smashed and multiple people arrested. Bank windows were smashed. Wreckage littered the inside of an AT&T store. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop, but instances of vandalism and smash-and-grab thefts mounted as the night deepened. “We worked hard to build up the business, and within a second, someone does this,” said the owner of a ransacked Manhattan smoke shop, who identified himself only by the name Harri. “Really bad.” New York joined other cities around the country in imposing a curfew after days of unrest. It comes on top of months of restrictions on public gatherings already imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Enough mayhem happened before the curfew took effect that Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted that it would move up to 8 p.m. Tuesday. The curfew lifts at 5 a.m. De Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the outbreaks of violence the previous two evenings — which left stores ransacked and police vehicles burned — gave them no choice to impose a curfew and boost police presence, even as they insisted they stood with the throngs of peaceful demonstrators who have spoken out for several days against police brutality and racial injustice. “We can’t let violence undermine the message of this moment,” de Blasio said in a statement. He and Cuomo are Democrats. Big crowds rallied in Times Square and Brooklyn on Monday afternoon and marched through the streets for hours. As in previous days, the demonstrations in daylight were peaceful, with officers mostly keeping their distance from marchers. A nighttime march through Brooklyn was also peaceful, and police let it continue for hours after the 11 a.m. curfew passed. But midtown Manhattan descended into chaos as night fell. There were dozens of arrests, police said. De Blasio tweeted at 1 a.m. that there were also “real problems” in the Bronx, which had largely escaped previous nights of unrest unscathed. Video posted on social media showed multiple piles of rubbish on fire on a debris-strewn street and people smashing into stories. Another video showed a group of men beating a police officer who was alone and down on the ground, smashing him with pieces of wreckage until he pulled his gun and they ran. After the curfew took effect, police moved more actively to clear the streets, chasing after and knocking down some people who wouldn’t comply as they streamed toward Times Square. At the same time, the city’s elected public advocate, Jumaane Williams, and some other officials held a news conference in Brooklyn criticizing the curfew. “In the black community, every time we ask for resources or assistance, they send police,” said Williams, a Democrat. Earlier in the day, one Times Square demonstrator, Giselle Francisco, considered the curfew necessary. “There are people who have ulterior motives, and they’re trying to hijack the message,” the New Yorker said. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea expressed doubts earlier Monday about whether a curfew would be heeded. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a retired police captain whose borough has been a focal point for demonstrations and some damage, also had doubts. “There are real deep, legitimate wounds, and if we’re not going to put the same level of energy into correcting those wounds as we’re going to put into telling people not to come out at 11, then we’re going to fail, and this is going to prolong the problem,” said Adams, a Democrat. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in Manhattan’s chic Soho neighborhood Sunday night, explained the destruction this way: “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ’Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this … again.’” Monday marked the fourth night in a row of mainly peaceful daytime demonstrations, chaotic nights, hot spots of violence and arrests, with the mayor’s daughter among those arrested over the weekend. Chiara de Blasio, 25, refused to leave a Manhattan street officers were clearing Saturday because people were throwing things. She was released with a court summons. Her father said Monday she told him she’d behaved peacefully and believed she had followed officers’ instructions. Thousands of people havetaken to the streets around the nation to express outrage over Floyd’s May 25 death and other killings of black people, particularly by police. Floyd, who was black, died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck. On Sunday, some New York City police officers knelt with protesters. But officers have also clashed with demonstrators. Shea said the department is investigating officers’ behavior in about six confrontations, including one in which two police vehicles plowed through a group of protesters Saturday in Brooklyn. During Sunday night’s demonstration, video posted to social media showed a police officer pulling a gun and pointing it at demonstrators on a debris-littered Manhattan street moments after a protester used an object to deliver a crushing blow to another officer’s head a few yards away. “That officer should have his gun and badge taken away today,” de Blasio said. Cuomo said some officers had exacerbated tensions with some “very disturbing” actions. Police union president Patrick Lynch said Cuomo was ”wrongly blaming the chaos on the cops.” ___ Contributing were Associated Press writers Larry Neumeister, Jake Seiner, Maria Sanminatelli, Michael R.

As of 7:45 p.m., about 50 protesters were standing on the sidewalk at the intersection of Campbell Avenue and 3rd Street. Protesters gathered late Monday afternoon outside the city’s police department, eventually speaking with Police Chief Sam Roman. “He asked you three questions,” one protester shouted at the chief, saying the chief did not answer the questions. Roman’s appearance came after repeated calls all weekend long by protesters for him to come to the protests and talk to them. “Unfortunately, my time was at a premium,” Roman said in an interview with 10 News Monday morning. Roman ended his conversation with protesters Monday afternoon by saying he had a meeting to get to. That did not sit well with the protesters. As Roman walked away, the protesters followed him for a short distance. A short time later, they moved next door to the city jail and then a little further down the sidewalk on Campbell Avenue. In his Monday morning interview with 10 News, Roman said he always tries to reach out and talk to the community as much as possible and is responding to the calls and emails he’s getting. “The comments, obviously, are as broad and variant as perspectives,"" said Roman. ""I understand where the frustrations are coming from.” As for meeting with protesters in the future, he did not say yes or no. Instead, saying he hopes to talk to protest organizers before a protest and be involved in the planning process. Monday’s protest followed three weekend protests. The first was an hourslong, peaceful protest Saturday afternoon with protesters marching from Washington Park to the police department and then back to the park. Late Saturday night until early Sunday morning, a different group of protesters, numbering possibly in the hundreds, marched through the streets of downtown Roanoke. This group had also been to the Valley View Walmart, also making stops at Target nearby, the Burlington on Hershberger Road and the Sheetz across from the Berglund Center. [Breaking down the timeline of Saturday evening’s Roanoke protests] The group ended at the police department where someone threw a firework over the group and into the lines of police officers outside the police department. Police then declared the protest an unlawful assembly and officers then began dispersing the protesters. On Sunday, protesters gathered for a couple of hours at the police department, then marched to Market Square and spent several hours there. Monday afternoon, businesses said they were only a little nervous as the protest was taking place Sunday. “You see everything that’s going on in other, bigger cities,"" said Bayou Snowballs owner Crystal Bolton. The business is directly across the street from Market Square. Bolton applauds the police department’s handling of the protest. “I think the Roanoke City Police Department did a really great job of giving them their space and allowing them to protest and have their time,"" said Bolton. “For us, it was okay. But after you close, you don’t know what’s going to happen.” Three Notch’d is also directly across the street. General Manager Emily Laney said Sunday’s gathering was the definition of a peaceful protest. “It was great. It was a true, genuine expression of the right to free speech and the right to convene in protest,"" Laney said. Both she and Bolton and the chief are glad to see people standing up for what they believe in. “I understand the sentiments of the people right now and I share in some of those sentiments,"" Roman said. “Being able to express yourself in a peaceful protest is important,"" said Bolton. “We as individuals, we as Americans, we have that right to take a stance and we have that right to put that out there and stand up for what we believe in,"" Laney said.",0.0

Floyd's death, ruled a homicide on Monday by a county medical examiner and by an independent autopsy commissioned by Floyd's family, has sparked outrage nationwide. A bystander's video that showed now-fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes has circulated widely since Floyd's Memorial Day death. Chavin has since been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, though Floyd's family wants the former officer charged with first-degree murder. Family attorney Ben Crump on Monday again called for peace. ""Let's remember to take a breath, America,"" Crump said. ""Let's take a breath for George. Let's take breath for peace. Let's take a breath for justice. Let's take a breath to heal our country. George Floyd protests:How did we get here? Here's a look at protests from around the nation: Phoenix: Officers kneel, crowd disperses minutes before curfew Cheers of “thank you” and “take a knee!” rang across the crowd in downtown Phoenix as at least three police officers knelt. Just before Phoenix’s 8 p.m. curfew, protesters had negotiated with police: If officers knelt, they said, then the roughly 100 protesters would disperse to their homes. Police obliged. The crowd applauded. “Images like these reflect our willingness to listen and work toward solutions,” Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams tweeted. The gesture capped off an early night for Phoenix protests. The crowd was smaller than previous nights, but included at least 100 outside the Phoenix Police Department headquarters and about 100 advocating outside Fourth Avenue Jail for the release of protesters who had been arrested Sunday. – Arizona Republic Seattle: Police take a knee during protests, later clash with protesters A reporter with KIRO-TV in Washington tweeted two vastly different protest scenes Monday night. The first tweet showed two officers taking a knee with protesters in a show of solidarity. The second, posted almost two hours later, showed a massive crowd of protesters on Capitol Hill clashing with police. Law enforcement officers at the scene used tear gas and spray chemical irritants. The Seattle Times reported downtown businesses could be seeing boarding up windows in anticipation of protests potentially turning violent. Police response:Police across US speak out against actions of Minneapolis police in George Floyd's death Cincinnati: Crowds remain after curfew; protesters, reporter detained Curfew came and went and the crowds remained. Until they were detained. A SWAT vehicle drove behind a group of demonstrators, who had been marching through the city since 1 p.m., with an officer shouting through a megaphone: ""You're in violation of curfew."" At about 8:15 p.m., a group of officers with riot shields marched down the street and began making arrests. Some protesters ran. Others put their hands up. By 10 p.m. local time, streets were largely empty. Patrick Brennan, a Cincinnati Enquirer reporter, was briefly detained by police while covering protests. The Cincinnati Enquirer is part of the USA TODAY Network. Journalists are exempt from the city's curfew. Brennan was released without being charged. The police department later issued a statement on Twitter saying officers were trying to clear the street while rocks were thrown at them. Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley said the incident was ""a big mistake"" in a statement posted on Twitter. – Sarah Brookbank, Hannah K.

Near 11 p.m., a fire was started at Dino's Food Mart, where McAtee was shot. About 100 protesters were at the scene prior to the fire. The fire started before 10:45 p.m. and emergency response teams had swarmed the scene within 5 minutes. A large presence of police and National Guard members were at the site as 11 p.m. approached, with some protesters still in the area holding their ground as well. – Lucas Aulbach and Ben Tobin, Louisville Courier Journal Chicago: Police, rioters clash on Broadway; National Guard deployed Hundreds of Chicago police officers clashed with a small group of young men throwing rocks and pieces of brick on Broadway shortly after the 9 p.m curfew began. Glass bottles shattered on the pavement and cinders crunched underfoot as police officers advanced upon the group, quickly dispersing them with the threat of arrest. At least one young man was taken into custody. Another man, Medhi Akbar, said he was knocked over during the scuffle, showing reporters his bloody face. Protesters shattered several windows along Broadway as they retreated from police, who refrained from using any chemical dispersants. Access to Chicago’s downtown was largely shut down Sunday by authorities after looting and fires in the Loop area, pushing the unrest west and south. Speaking to reporters Monday, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot denied that the restrictions and police presence downtown were coming at the expense of other neighborhoods, and promised all areas would be protected equally.

After a short speech a few hours later, a man leading the protest thanked everyone for coming and told everyone to go home. People dispersed. There were police lights flash in the distance, but not an officer in sight. Later, however, Las Vegas police engaged a crowd of people with pepper bullets at Fremont and Las Vegas Boulevard. One man was pepper-sprayed: “I can’t breathe,” he’s saying. “I can’t breathe.” – Ed Komenda, Reno Gazette Journal Fort Worth, Texas: SWAT officers pray with protesters after citywide curfew A fourth night of protests in Fort Worth ended peacefully, with police in riot gear kneeling with protesters to pray. The groups remained in dialogue throughout the night, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. Hundreds of people lingered outside the Tarrant County courthouse after the 8 p.m. citywide curfew. Police cars began to pull up to the protesters 30 minutes after, announcing that the protesters were in violation of the curfew. Many protesters linked arms and refused to move, then knelt and encouraged the officers to do the same, according to the Star-Telegram. About 9:30 p.m., Police Chief Ed Kraus and officers in riot gear knelt along with protesters. Shortly after, per Kraus's order, SWAT officers left and protesters then began leaving. “You just showed the nation how to do it,” Kraus shouted. The protest ended with no arrests. Kraus had, previously Monday, marched with the protesters, telling the Star-Telegram that organizers have been doing a good job keeping things calm, but outsiders “infiltrated” the protest with a different agenda. – Elinor Aspegren, USA TODAY Memphis, Tennessee: Protesters march downtown ahead of curfew After five consecutive nights of Memphis residents taking to the streets to oppose police brutality, protesters began another march winding through the city's downtown. A small group of demonstrators approached the justice center and a few began screaming at about two dozen officers in riot gear. A glass entryway separates the group from the officers. A larger group of protesters appeared to be moving off in an effort to deescalate the verbal confrontation. Ahead of the city's 10 p.m. curfew, some protesters said they were prepared to be arrested. In one scene at Civic Center Plaza, a Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper set down his nightstick at the request of the crowd — and apparent urging from a Memphis police officer. Protesters cheered in response before continuing to march. – Katherine Burgess, Samuel Hardiman, Desiree Stennett, Sarah Macaraeg and Max Garland, The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tenn.) Pittsburgh: Peaceful protest ends with tear gas, smoke for 'bad actors' Violence and destruction marred a peaceful protest outside the Target in Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood as people took to the streets for a third straight day to protest the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Hundreds of protesters marched in the streets of East Liberty for more than two hours, but after the official demonstration ended, destruction began. One protester struck the glass at Dollar Bank along Penn Avenue, while others tried to stop him. Protesters were warned to watch out for “bad actors” who might cause destruction. Pittsburgh public safety officials said that a splintered group of protesters began throwing items at police and break windows at the intersection of Centre Avenue and Negley Avenue. In response, police deployed tear gas and smoke to disperse the crowd. – Daveen Rae Kurutz and Chrissy Suttles, The Beaver County Times Los Angeles: Protesters hit Hollywood streets; demonstration ends with arrests About 300 Black Lives Matters protesters jammed the corner of Sunset and Vine in Hollywood under the gaze of Los Angeles police officers and National Guard troops. Splinter groups headed off down Hollywood Boulevard and other major streets as motorists honked in support. The protest ended with arrests. Surrounding merchants were busy boarding up their businesses in hopes of repelling looters. Later, more than thousand protesters marched through Hollywood in a demonstration that remained peaceful. The crowd included a few men in muscle cars airing their stereos and doing burnouts. One man dressed as Jesus Christ, holding a skateboard aloft along with a sign pointing to a passage in Corinthians. The crowd took over Sunset and Santa Monica boulevards. One woman was helping to direct cars that inadvertently got stuck among all the marchers. The demonstration ended with police herding protesters into smaller groups. One group of about 30 were lined up against a shuttered office building on Sunset Boulevard and put into plastic handcuffs, awaiting a trip to jail. – Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY New York City: Looters break away from peaceful march, smash windows As a march with several thousand protesters worked its way toward midtown, a group of several hundred, mostly younger people, broke away and started running downtown. Upon reaching 15th Street, the group smashed the windows of a Verizon Store and looted it. Then the group ran to 14th street and looted a Foot Locker — a store that had been boarded up, but to no avail. Soon after, three police cruisers arrived and chased the group east on 14th Street toward Union Square Park. 'We know people are angry and hurting': 2 New York officers struck by vehicle during George Floyd protests in Buffalo In midtown along 5th Avenue, looters were attacking the Microsoft store at 53rd street. They had already ransacked the Coach store on 54th and 5th which was in the process of being boarded up. Tony Jaggernath, manager of construction crew, said he arrived at the Coach store at 8 p.m. to put up plywood to protect the first-story windows. But they never got a chance to finish. Soon, looters were upon them, ripping down the plywood and throwing stones through the windows and at Jaggernath. ""They came by and ripped off the boards right as we were putting them up,"" Jaggernath said. ""We're not against you, we're just working here,"" Jaggernath said he told the group. Just up the street, Madeline Cisneros of The Bronx stood behind a black police van, surrounded by eight police officers. Her hands were ziptied behind her back, and she looked scared. Her friend Morgan Maselli, 29, also of The Bronx, filmed the police officers as she yelled at them. ""She didn't do anything! Her backpack is filled with water and bandages! She's here to help!""

The message from protesters around the United States is that George Floyd is the latest addition to a grim roster of African Americans to be killed by police or white civilians. (AP Photo/Noah Berger, File) CHICAGO – In Baltimore, protesters shouted the name of Freddie Gray. In Topeka, Kansas, T-shirts were emblazoned with the name of Dominique White. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, people gathered in a spot where white mobs killed hundreds of blacks a century ago and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher. Across the U.S. as protesters poured into the streets to voice anger about last week's death of George Floyd, they also marked the occasion with reminders that the handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as on officer pinned him to the pavement with his knee on his neck is simply the latest addition to a grim roster. Their stories have substantial differences, but protesters used their names and faces on posters to drive home the point that Floyd is part of a larger story about the dangers of being black in the United States. ""George Floyd is causing people in their own communities to recall, reflect and then get angry all over again about their own police killings,“ said Marshall Hatch, a Chicago minister who eulogized Bettie Jones, who was struck by a bullet from an officer responding to a domestic dispute at a neighbor's house that also left 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier dead in 2015. Hatch said Floyd’s death has served as a reminder to continue to push for justice in deaths throughout the country. He said that on Wednesday, he and other religious leaders plan to gather outside police headquarters to demand the officer who was fired after fatally shooting Jones and LeGrier also face criminal charges. “There is a lot of feelings of incomplete justice all over the country,” he said. Allisa Findley, whose brother, Botham Jean, was killed in 2018 inside his apartment by a white Dallas police officer who said she mistook his apartment for her own told WFAA television in Dallas, ""It is like pouring salt into an open wound every time there is another case.” “Yes, it’s a different name, but it’s the same situation,” Findley said In New York, many protesters shouted, “I can’t breathe,” a reminder that the words Floyd said in his last moments of life echoed what Eric Garner, stopped by police in New York City’s Staten Island for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes, said when a police officer put him in what appeared to be a chokehold in 2014. One of the first things Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said publicly about Floyd's death was that it brought back to her the pain that the city felt in 2015 when a video of a white police officer shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald was released. In Oakland, California, protesters gathered at Oscar Grant Plaza, named for the 22-year-old who was pulled by police from a Bay Area Rapid Transit train early on New Year's Day 2009 and killed in one of the first police shootings captured on video by bystanders. Grant's mother, Wanda Johnson, could not help but think of her son when she saw a bystander's video of Floyd's final moments. “It brought back so many memories of them trying to demonize him, then trying to have other officers there and none trying to control the situation,” Johnson told KRON-TV in the Bay Area. In Baltimore, it was impossible not to think of what happened in 2015 — from the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray after he suffered major spinal injuries while being transported in a police van to the unrest that followed. “It was a stark reminder of our own city’s trauma,” Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young told the Baltimore Sun. While Gray's name has remained part of the national conversation about police treatment of blacks, what has been striking is that demonstrations in every corner of the country tell their own piece of a larger story. Terence Crutcher was fatally shot in 2016 by a white police officer, Betty Shelby, who was later acquitted of manslaughter. “If you all could just scream at the top of your lungs and let Terence know that you still care, that you haven’t forgotten,” his twin sister, Tiffany Crutcher, told a Tulsa crowd. Michael Ramos, described by friends and family as black and Hispanic, was fatally shot by Austin, Texas, police in April as the 42-year-old drove away from officers after first being shot with a beanbag. The shooting remains under investigation, and Ramos' mom, Brenda Ramos, questioned why the officer who shot him hasn't been arrested or at least suspended. “Now I am in this terrible heartbreaking club,"" Ramos' mom, Brenda Ramos, told reporters over the weekend. ""It's a club of mothers of black Americans who have been murdered by police.” In Topeka, protests included the shouts of, “Say his name! Dominique White.” The 30-year-old Topeka man was armed when officers, responding to a report of gunfire, confronted him and fatally shot him in 2017. While an internal police investigation found the officers followed department policies, protesters still have questions, as do relatives who have filed a lawsuit. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo posted a slide with the names of many black men killed or abused by police in cities around the nation. “You are blind, or in denial, if you are still treating each one like a unique situation,” he said at his Saturday morning press briefing. “How many times have we seen the same situation?

But the color doesn’t.” ___ Associated Press reporters David Caruso in New York; John Hanna in Topeka, Kan.; Dylan Lovanin Louisville, Ky.; Kate Brumback in Atlanta; and Paul Weber in Austin, Texas, contributed to this report.",0.0

When he sprinkles crack cocaine in his hand-rolled cigarettes,1 his mood sours. He gets agitated, frenetic.

The couple lives out of the faded maroon Nissan Sentra he drives.2 It’s not much, but it keeps them dry and warm. On this mild December night, he drops her off around 9 p.m. at a friend’s house, saying he’ll be back soon.3 When he returns, she can tell he’s high by the way he starts mouthing off at her. They begin bickering. She’s not keen on getting back in the car, but she has to be in court the next morning and needs to stop by her daughter’s house to get ready.4 Her boyfriend pulls in to the Exxon Nine Mile Pit Stop, just a few minutes’ drive from Church Hill, where Kimberly’s daughter lives. They’re regulars here, and tonight they roll up to pump No. 5 and Kimberly hops out to pay. She exchanges hellos and how-are-yous with the friendly security guard and stops by the restroom.5 When she returns to the car, her boyfriend has backed into a parking space, so she settles in to try calling her daughter.6 Kimberly notices a police car driving by, but doesn’t give it much thought.7 HENRICO COUNTY POLICE OFFICER Joel D. Greenway needs to fill up with gas and decides to swing by an intersection that he and another officer had been “keeping an eye on.”8 He’s not assigned to this route anymore, but he’d assisted his prior supervisor in making drug arrests at the station near the county/city line.9 After graduating from basic training in August 2013, he had started working a beat that September, giving him a little more than two years on the force. Before entering law enforcement, Greenway served as a missionary in Brazil for two years and waited tables while finishing college in Utah, getting married and starting a family.10 Tonight, it’s around 10:30 p.m., about an hour before his shift ends. If he sees something suspicious, he’ll investigate. If not, he’ll just buy his gas and go.11 One of Greenway’s old supervisors had coined the Exxon station a “hot spot” for drug activity, and tonight a maroon sedan with two people inside catches his eye.12 He parks near a scrapping business and cuts through the grass separating him from the Exxon lot. He squeezes between dumpsters and shrubbery so the car’s occupants don’t see him approaching.13 The male driver has flicked on the dome light and is fiddling with something in his lap. Before Greenway can get a better look, the driver turns off the light. The officer notes the license plate number and communicates via police radio that he’s approaching a suspicious vehicle. Inching up to the passenger window, he floods the car with his flashlight and raps on the glass.14 “What are we doing tonight?” he asks.15 The driver drops several folded lottery tickets in his lap.16 × 1 of 2 Expand Photos of the Nissan Sentra presented as court exhibits show where bullets struck the vehicle.

A sudden knock on her rolled-up window startles her. It’s hard to make out the figure outside.17 “Roll down the window,” a man’s voice orders.18 Shining a light at the couple, he tells them to show their hands. Kimberly obliges, but her boyfriend’s hands hover between the wheel and the gearshift. His first thought: We’re being carjacked.19 PROBABLE CAUSE. That’s what Greenway thinks when he notices wadded lottery tickets in the driver’s lap.20 Probable cause to detain the couple and search the car. He thinks about other arrests he’d observed that involved drugs packaged inside such tickets.21 A police axiom, “Where there’s drugs, there’s guns,” plays in his mind.22 He tells the couple to put up their hands. The woman does as she’s told, but the driver’s eyes dart about erratically.23 His hands hang in the air for a moment, then he digs them into his waistband with the tickets. Greenway draws his firearm as he shifts to the right — so the passenger isn’t caught between the two men in the event of gunfire exchange. The driver reaches for the gearshift and Greenway yells at him to stop, but the vehicle lurches forward, thrusting him onto the hood.24 KIMBERLY'S BOYFRIEND drops the car into drive and starts moving toward the street. His foot has hardly hit the gas when gunshots ring out and, a split second later, Kimberly realizes she’s been struck.25 Only then does she see that the shooter is a police officer. Covering her head and face with her hands, she screams, “Please don’t shoot me again!” She hears her skull crack26 as another bullet — one of seven fired27 — punctures the back of her head.28 The car passes the officer and hops the median onto Nine Mile Road,29 before it crashes — rocking Kimberly’s boyfriend forward and fracturing his eye socket.30 Believing he’s been shot, too, he sprints toward the nearby woods for cover.31 I’m dying, Kimberly thinks, her eyes fixed on the sky.32 The security guard she’d spoken with minutes earlier rushes outside to apply pressure to her wounds. Paramedics cut away her clothes. ••• After an investigation by two Henrico County police detectives, Greenway is indicted in February 2016 on three felonies in connection with the Dec. 15, 2015, incident: malicious wounding, shooting into an occupied vehicle and use of a firearm in commission of a felony. Henrico’s circuit court judges recuse themselves, citing real or perceived conflicts of interest, and a retired Chesterfield County judge presides over Greenway’s criminal trial. During the trial, a police academy instructor who taught Greenway testifies that a weapon should be discharged only in extreme circumstances, and officers are taught that stepping in front of a vehicle makes them vulnerable.33 Greenway’s attorneys argue that even if he violated departmental policy, that doesn’t mean he broke the law. Greenway’s suspicion of drugs was confirmed when a forensic expert identified cocaine residue on the lottery tickets, but the couple was unarmed. In October 2016, a jury acquits Greenway of all criminal charges. McNeil, who suffered a seizure after testifying, is absent when the jury delivers its findings, but her daughter leaves the courtroom spewing profanities. Her cousin tells reporters he feels “there is no justice.” On the other side of the courtroom, Greenway’s wife and mother break into tears when the jury delivers the verdicts after 10 hours of deliberation. A civil suit McNeil filed in April in Henrico Circuit Court is moved to U.S. District Court. The suit claims Greenway’s “reckless actions” violated McNeil’s Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable government intrusion, resulting in life-threatening injuries. The suit seeks $75 million and a civil jury trial, but is settled in December 2016. Henrico pays a $750,000 settlement, and the county approves spending nearly $15,000 toward Greenway’s legal expenses after his criminal case acquittal.34 Later, the criminal case is expunged, making records in circuit court unavailable. By January 2017, Greenway is no longer working for the county. His attorneys say he resigned and now lives out of state. McNeil suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. A brain injury affects her speech and cognitive functions. She stopped smoking crack.35 Property records show she purchased a small, two-story house in eastern Henrico after the settlement — just around the corner from another Exxon station.36 Infographic sources: 2016 Crime in Virginia Annual Report; Henrico, Chesterfield, Richmond and VCU police departments; Officer Down Memorial Page; Washington Post II. Waking the ‘Sleeping Dragon’ Public reaction to high-profile shootings is changing the nature of police work The December 2015 shooting of Kimberly McNeil, an unarmed African-American woman, by a white Henrico County police officer occurred at a time of growing public scrutiny of law enforcement actions nationally. Freddie Gray in Baltimore; Sandra Bland in Waller County, Texas; Walter Scott in Charleston, South Carolina; and Samuel DuBose in Cincinnati — all of them African-American — died the same year after being stopped by white police officers. Only in Scott’s case was there a conviction against the officer involved; Michael Slager pleaded guilty to civil rights charges and received a 20-year sentence. Charlotte Hodges, a personal injury attorney who represented McNeil in her civil case, says that different standards of proof apply to criminal and civil cases, and this is significant in determining the outcome. “You can put almost all the exact same information out in a criminal case and a civil case, and the jury — because they have to find you, in a criminal case, guilty beyond a reasonable doubt — may not feel they can reach that standard to find you guilty,” Hodges says. “In a civil liability case, [the jury] has to find by clear and convincing evidence.” It’s 100 percent the discretion of the chief when an agency should relinquish control of a criminal investigation to an outside agency.” —Shannon Taylor, Henrico commonwealth’s attorney In the deaths of Gray, Bland and DuBose, charges were either dropped or the officers acquitted — coupled with a few million dollars in settlement money for the families of the deceased. These outcomes spawned protests across the country, along with a public outcry for increased transparency among police departments. In Richmond, college students and community members took to the VCU campus, downtown streets and Interstate 95 to protest unjust treatment of African-Americans by police. Demonstrations punctuated national news events such as the nonindictment of former Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson after the August 2014 shooting death of Michael Brown; the beating of University of Virginia student Martese Johnson by two ABC agents in 2015; and the shooting deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling on July 5 and 6, 2016. Activists demanded answers to questions such as: Why are so many officers acquitted? Why are so few indicted in the first place? “It’s 100 percent the discretion of the chief when an agency should relinquish control of a criminal investigation to an outside agency,” says Shannon Taylor, the Henrico commonwealth’s attorney who prosecuted the Greenway case. In other words, unless the police department decides to outsource an investigation to another department such as Virginia State Police or the FBI, the sequence of events after a contentious use of force incident relies heavily upon the department’s policies and procedures. In such cases, the criminal investigation is conducted by detectives within the department. The evidence compiled by the investigating officers is presented to the prosecutor, who decides whether a criminal indictment is in order. Police officers are also afforded sovereign immunity — a doctrine granting government officials protection from being sued for doing their jobs. But that immunity does not extend to violations of constitutional rights, as McNeil’s civil suit against Greenway claimed. Across the Richmond region, similar cases of officer use-of-force being prosecuted are scarce. Since Taylor was elected in 2012, she has not prosecuted another case like Greenway’s. In Richmond, there have not been indictments of officers for similar charges in more than a decade. (An off-duty Richmond officer who fatally shot an unarmed teenager at a Chesterfield County car wash in 2015 did receive a three-month sentence for manslaughter.) × Expand Richmond Police Capt. Harvey Powers says that traffic stops and domestic violence calls are statistically the most dangerous situations for officers. (Photo by Sarah Lockwood) Since 2015, there have been 60 incidents of police using fatal force in Virginia, according to a Washington Post database. Of that number, five of the people killed were unarmed. Each year, the number of victims armed with a gun or knife accounts for more than two-thirds of the total deaths across the country, according to the database. The number of fatal uses of force nationally has remained relatively consistent since the Post began compiling the data at an average of roughly 980 deaths per year from 2015 to 2017. In Virginia, the number has averaged 19 each year. As of March 12, three people in Virginia — each of whom was armed — died this year in encounters with police. One of them was a 40-year-old Richmond man shot on Interstate 64 east of Richmond after a police chase; he emerged from his car carrying a machete. Captured on Camera Relatively few use-of-force incidents have been documented with footage from an officer’s body camera, even as the devices have become widespread. A 2013 survey by the U.S. Department of Justice found less than a fourth of 500 surveyed departments used body-worn cameras at that time. On May 1, 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a $20 million Body-Worn Camera Pilot Program after a spike in departments seeking the technology to reduce excessive force and citizen complaints post-Ferguson. By November 2017, 62 of the 67 “major city” departments were outfitted with the cameras, according to the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which keeps a scorecard on body-camera policies. Among the local agencies, Henrico County was the department first to equip officers with the cameras on a trial basis in September 2014. During a Henrico Board of Supervisors meeting that year, then-Police Chief Douglas Middleton cited research indicating a “sharp drop in complaints” against officers who wear the cameras, and aimed to equip the department’s roughly 400 uniformed officers by Jan. 1, 2016. Richmond started issuing cameras to officers with a pilot program in 2016 and expanded to roughly half the force of sworn officers in 2017; Chesterfield and Hanover counties and Virginia State Police added them in 2017. Each department maintains its own body-worn camera policy. The Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services published a “Model Policy on Body Worn Cameras” as a template in October 2015. In Henrico, officers are instructed to turn on the camera when engaging in traffic stops, suspicious vehicles or persons, domestic calls for service, arrests or calls involving mental health patients. In Richmond, officers assigned a body-worn camera are instructed to start recordings as soon as a call for service is initiated. Both policies require approval from the police chief or his designee for anyone outside the department and the commonwealth’s attorney’s office to view footage, and unless the footage is tagged as evidence, it will be deleted within 60 days in Richmond, 90 in Henrico. According to the Washington Post data, only 100 of the 987 deaths involving fatal force nationally in 2017 were captured on video —a decrease from 2016, when 145 of the 963 uses of fatal force were recorded. To date, 11 of the 195 deaths nationally in 2018 have been captured on tape. In Virginia, five of the 17 deaths in 2016 were recorded, but none of the 23 deaths in 2017 were on camera, nor were any of the three deaths this year. Proponents of the cameras believe they increase transparency and accountability among law enforcement — and studies have corroborated they reduce uses of force and complaints from residents. But some groups fear recordings could infringe upon privacy and free speech rights; without a uniform state policy, individual departments maintain too much discretion over footage. “We don’t think those cameras should be used to surveil First Amendment activities and that they shouldn’t be turned on unless and until there’s actual crimes being committed,” says Claire Guthrie Gastañaga, executive director of the ACLU of Virginia. And just because footage exists doesn’t mean that it’s accessible to the public. A Feb. 4 traffic stop garnered attention online after a Chesterfield officer pointed a gun at a Virginia State University freshman, who told police he had a knife and started to reach for it. The student was unharmed and eventually let go, but when Yesha Callahan, the boy’s mother, wanted to view the body camera footage, the agency denied her request. Chesterfield pointed to exemptions from Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act that allow police to keep records from public view if the materials are involved in a criminal investigation. When Callahan filed a complaint with the department, the county cited another FOIA exemption — “personnel matters” — due to the complaint triggering an internal investigation of the incident. Chesterfield’s body-worn camera policy states that requests to view footage are considered after consultation with the county attorney’s office. Callahan eventually did see the footage, on March 11 at the police station, but she says her 18-year-old son is still shaken up from the incident. She says when she viewed the footage, one of the officers said the firearm display was justified. “They said ‘yeah,’ it would’ve been justified [if the officer had pulled the trigger]. The way they explained it was like, ‘You know, they wouldn’t know what kind of weapon it was.’ ” Chesterfield Police Chief Jeffrey Katz says he empathizes with Callahan, and as a parent understands how frightening it can be when kids are exposed to a potentially dangerous encounter. “A lot of times people … fill in the blanks with worst-case scenarios, but it doesn’t speak to reality, it speaks to our fears — and especially when it comes to our kids,” he says. “We love our kids.” Infographic sources: Henrico, Chesterfield, Richmond and VCU police departments; U.S. Census Assessing Threats Balancing caution against police brutality is the ever-present awareness that a routine call or traffic stop could cost an officer his or her life. According to the Officer Down Memorial Page, which keeps a running database online of line of duty deaths, two Chesterfield officers and one K-9 partner died in the line of duty, all from gunfire, since 2000. In Henrico, an officer drowned in 2003 and Richmond lost an officer the same year to gunfire. The Virginia State Police, which has the largest authorized force and jurisdiction, lost 13 troopers in the last 18 years, nearly half from vehicle-involved injuries. For officers, the split-second decision to shoot or not shoot is complex — and at times, haunting. After exchanging gunfire during a traffic stop, Richmond Police Capt. Harvey Powers couldn’t get it out of his mind. “I had nightmares about it for six months,” says Powers, an officer for more than two decades. When Powers pulled over a car for running a stop sign around 3 a.m., something just “felt wrong.” The hair on his neck stood up as he took the driver’s ID and noticed the disarray of the backseat. He walked back to his patrol car and opened the driver’s side door, then closed it again without getting inside. Instead, he walked around the back of his vehicle. As he approached the passenger side of the stopped vehicle, the man was pulling out an assault rifle from the back seat. “We exchanged fire and I put two rounds on the car door and he drove away,” Powers says, adding that the man was eventually arrested. “I didn’t hit him; I didn’t get hit; life goes on, but traffic stops are the most dangerous things in the world for police officers. If you just put your hands on the steering wheel there can be no misunderstanding.” (Editor's note: In a related story, ""What Would You Do?"" Powers leads a group of law students in a simulation exercise to see how they would handle a tense situation an officer might face.) He acknowledges that there is a basis for some of the public’s distrust of police. “There are racist cops, and we need to get rid of them. But just because there’s a racial disparity when a cop makes a mistake, does not necessarily mean that was the motivating factor,” Powers says. × Expand Protesters march in Richmond on July 16, 2016, in response to the fatal police shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. (Photo by Sarah King) Culture Change Richmond Police Chief Alfred Durham says Michael Brown’s death was a catalyst for change in the culture of police departments to work more proactively at building trust through accountability and transparency. “I always say, ‘That woke the sleeping dragon in law enforcement across this country,’ ” he says. In Henrico, the department began mandating annual Crisis Intervention Training for officers starting in 2015, to hone skills pertaining to de-escalation and when to use force, if at all. “Our philosophy is you use the minimal amount of force necessary to achieve whatever that lawful means or objective needs to be,” says Henrico Police Chief Humberto Cardounel Jr. At Virginia Commonwealth University, where the campus police department’s jurisdiction encompasses inherently challenging environments such as the hospital’s secure mental health wards, Police Chief John Venuti has taken the unusual step of establishing an external committee to review every use-of-force incident, beginning last year. Venuti, who transitioned from the Richmond Police Department’s homicide unit to VCU police chief in 2010, says his philosophy revolves around one central question: Was force necessary? “If force is not necessary, it can never be justified. And I think if you go back to the national conversation — to a lot of the incidents we’ve seen — that’s what the conversation is really about, right?” × Expand Assadique “Muhammad” Abdul-Rahman of New Virginia Majority talks with fellow activists about calling for more police accountability. (Photo by Jay Paul) III. Holding Police Accountable In Richmond, grassroots organizers push for more data, citizen review Inside the community room of the Richmond Public Library on Hull Street, the South Side chapter of New Virginia Majority is celebrating a victory. After a push by the nonprofit group, the Richmond Police Department began posting the data pertaining to each use -of-force incident in 2017, broken down by race, gender, sector and precinct, to be updated monthly. New Virginia Majority has chapters throughout the “urban crescent” of Virginia — spanning the suburbs of Washington, D.C. to the Hampton Roads region — working to face and dismantle systemic hurdles in minority communities. The Richmond chapter decided to focus on policing reforms, after canvassing neighborhoods from Oak Grove and Clopton, to Bainbridge in the South Side. “What we found is the number one issue is police accountability and community policing,” says Assadique “Muhammad” Abdul-Rahman, who is leading this February meeting of roughly a dozen adults. The chapter hosted a series of forums, some of which Richmond Police Chief Alfred Durham attended, where community members voiced concerns ranging from stop-and-frisk policies to searches and detainments. Then, last fall, the group circulated a petition asking the city to establish an elected, independent board “with subpoena-like power and the authority to hold RPD personnel accountable for misconduct and mistreatment of citizens.” Abdul-Rahman says the stories shared at the forums “weren’t compelling enough for the politicians and the police,” to support citizen oversight, so the chapter pursued a data release with the help of other local advocacy groups, including the Legal Aid Justice Center, the Advancement Project in D.C. and Richmond-based group Southerners on New Ground (SONG). “The No. 1 issue is police accountability and community policing.” —Assadique “Muhammad” Abdul-Rahman, a New Virginia Majority member “It’s not replacing the storytelling, but it gives us scaffolding to hang the stories on … to be able to say, ‘This is one person of, like, 75,’ ”says Kim Rolla, an attorney with the Legal Aid Justice Center’s Civil Rights and Racial Justice Program. Now, the community organizers hope to make a stronger case for a citizen review board, or “CRB,” as another transparency and oversight measure — and get the rest of the data they requested, specifically in regard to stop-and-frisks, which the police department did not include with the use-of-force data release. “The CRB actually is about power,” Abdul-Rahman says. “Right now, [police are] policing themselves — they’re in control of what data to give to the public.” He cites a Stanford University database of traffic stops across the country that found minority drivers were more likely to be stopped by police, ticketed, searched and arrested after being pulled-over. “This study indicates the most important data was not released, and we need to pursue it vigorously,” Abdul-Rahman says. Though he’s a proponent of community engagement, Richmond’s police chief is not keen on the idea of a citizen review board — a response not uncommon among law enforcement officials. “We’re not out here shooting and killing and beating people up, violating folks’ civil rights — and the thing is, they say it should be independent,” Durham says. “Well, if it should be independent — you don’t need my say. Get some legislation passed, and I’ll abide by it.” Thus far, three localities in Virginia have approved CRBs: Virginia Beach, Fairfax County and Charlottesville. Washington, D.C., also has one. The CRB concept has existed since the mid-20th century, but didn’t gain prominence until former President Barack Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing — formulated in part in response to widespread civil unrest after Michael Brown’s death in Ferguson, Missouri — published recommendations in May 2015. The report calls on agencies to adopt some form of civilian oversight — as well as formulate, and share publicly, “comprehensive policies” on the use of force and de-escalation, mass demonstrations, consent to searches, gender identification, racial profiling, external and independent investigations and prosecutions of officer-involved shootings and in-custody deaths. In early 2018, activists in Charlottesville lobbied for a CRB, and the City Council there voted in favor of the idea after a damning independent review. Released in November, the report analyzed police response to the “Unite the Right” rally of Aug. 12, 2017. The Charlottesville police chief resigned about two weeks later, and retired Chesterfield Police Chief Thierry Dupuis is leading the department on an interim basis. Charlottesville resident Rosia Parker was a key advocate in advancing the CRB, which she says stemmed from policies predating the rally — but were amplified by the report findings. “We have a lot of stop-and-frisks, where the black and brown people are the chosen ones to get harassed,” Parker says. She says the CRB is still in its planning stages — selecting committee members, interpreting the statute and putting a structural model in place — but she hopes the board will be up and running by the time a new chief of police arrives. “We see that [police] actions are not being held accountable,” Parker says, “and that needs to change.” Citations 1.

Earlier: If you were watching cable news coverage of the fiery clashes near the White House last night, you might have spotted “ACPD” on the helmets of some of the riot police. Your eyes did not deceive you. On Sunday, Arlington County Police began assisting with the law enforcement response to the protests, which have been mostly peaceful during the day but have turned destructive after dark for three straight nights. “ACPD’s Civil Disturbance Unit responded to a mutual aid request by United States Park Police for assistance maintain peace and order on federal park land,” department spokeswoman Ashley Savage confirmed, in response to inquiries from ARLnow. “ACPD began providing support [Sunday].” Police departments often provide mutual aid to one another in the D.C. area, with its mix of local, state and federal police forces. More routine mutual aid calls involve searches for suspects, often involving K-9 officers or helicopters — for instance, U.S. Park Police’s Eagle 1 helicopter. More rarely, mutual aid is requested for significant incidents, like shootings or standoffs. Park Police have been attempting to defend Lafayette Square, north of the White House, amid mass, nationwide protests that have followed the death of George Floyd at the hands of since-fired Minneapolis police officers, one of whom is now facing a murder charge.

Officers in ACPD helmets could be seen in photos and video (below) assisting with the forceful removal of protesters from around St. John’s Church, an action that involved the deployment of tear gas. Shortly thereafter, President Trump walked to the church and held up a bible, a move dismissed as a photo opportunity by critics and criticized as “antithetical to the teachings of Jesus” by the Episcopal bishop of Washington. “Appalled mutual aid agreement abused to endanger their and others safety for a photo op,” Garvey wrote just before 9 p.m., about two hours after the incident. “We ordered @ArlingtonVaPD to immediately leave DC.” “At the direction of the County Board, County Manager and Police Chief, all ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 tonight,” the county subsequently said in a brief statement. “The County is re-evaluating the agreements that allowed our officers to be put in a compromising position that endangered their health and safety, and that of the people around them, for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County police in riot gear were assisting with crowd control in Lafayette Square, near the White House, following a mutual aid request from Park Police. Such requests are typically used for suspect searches or to assist with significant incidents; Arlington often requests the assistance of the U.S. Park Police helicopter, for instance. Following inquiries from ARLnow, after we noticed ACPD helmets in a TV news broadcast Sunday night, a police spokeswoman earlier today confirmed that Arlington police were indeed in D.C. after a mutual aid request. “ACPD’s Civil Disturbance Unit responded to a mutual aid request by United States Park Police for assistance maintain peace and order on federal park land,” department spokeswoman Ashley Savage said. “ACPD began providing support [Sunday].” The department has worked to maintain a positive relationship with the community over the years, including by handing out water to protesters in Arlington on Sunday. On Friday, amid nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd, police chief M. Jay Farr released a statement. “It is impossible for us to achieve our mission if we lose the trust of our community,” he wrote. “When force is used, we must hold ourselves accountable for our actions.” “We work and live by a set of core values: courage, competence, commitment, compassion, restraint, respect and integrity,” the department says in its job description for new officers. Separately Monday night, Arlington County issued a statement regarding Floyd’s killing. “The Arlington County Board condemns the murder of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis, including the complicit officers who participated in and witnessed the murder,” the statement reads. “While the video was shocking, the circumstances of the murder should not be; they are too familiar in a nation where the disregard for and devaluing of Black lives is too common, and too often comes at the hands of the people sworn to protect them.” Police deploying tear gas amid protests in Washington, D.C. pic.twitter.com/jQjG0C3MKz — The Hill (@thehill) June 1, 2020 great photo op. nailed it pic.twitter.com/X7uedAcxHb — Brendan Karet 🚮 (@bad_takes) June 1, 2020 Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde: ""The President just used a Bible … and one of the churches of my diocese without permission as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything our churches stand for….I am outraged."" pic.twitter.com/yegcO7xoJ0 — Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) June 2, 2020 Alexandria Police were not in DC today. — Alexandria Police (@AlexandriaVAPD) June 2, 2020 Screenshot (top) via @thehill/Twitter",0.0

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he doesn't believe the federal government can send military troops into his state. He accused the president of creating an “incendiary moment” by threatening to do just that to quell violence that has arisen as demonstrators have taken to the streets in reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois,"" Pritzker said on CNN after Trump urged governors to deploy the Guard. If they did not, he said he would send in “thousands and thousands” of soldiers. Pritzker was among the first governors to react to Trump's comments, which came hours after the president called governors “weak” and urged them to take a more aggressive response to weekend violence. It came as Americans gathered to protest police brutality against black Americans following the killing of Floyd, who was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with people breaking into and stealing from businesses, smashing car windows and setting fires. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not deployed the state's National Guard to New York City, although he said earlier Monday the state had 13,000 troops that “we can use at any moment.” “I say thank you but no thank you,"" Cuomo said on CNN about Trump's call to send military troops to the states. At least 23 states and the District of Columbia had already deployed guard troops as of Monday morning, according to a statement from the National Guard. It wasn't clear whether the action would be enough to satisfy the president. Trump took no questions from reporters and did not say how he would decide whether a state's response was sufficient. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has activated the state's guard, said in a statement he prays “no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.” “This president has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office,"" Inslee said in a statement. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat, said any suggestions the state's National Guard is ill equipped to handle the states needs is “misinformed.” ""As the Commander In Chief of the Nevada National Guard I can state, categorically, that they have done their duty to protect all Nevadans, and will continue to do so.” In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of demonstrators. She refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation, but on Monday activated 50 unarmed guard members in support roles. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” Brown, a Democrat, said earlier Monday in reaction to Trump's comments about governors being weak in their response. “Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform.” She didn't immediately comment on Trump's remarks about deploying the U.S. military. Nor did California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has deployed thousands of guard troops to Los Angeles and other cities. He called Trump's morning comments “noise” and avoided addressing them directly, although he said the nation is desperate for leadership. Guard members can assist law enforcement and perform duties such as traffic control, communications support and extinguishing fires. __ Associated Press writers Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington, and Michelle Price in Las Vegas contributed to this report.",0.0

It blinded us to how severely it hurt the African American community and that was never, ever, ever the intention. We love our community that we’re in and that’s why we came here,” said Fifth and Federal owner Josh Read. ""We love all of our neighbors and people in this community. We’re just really saddened to see how badly they were hurt from that. That was never our intention. I’d love for community leaders to reach out so that we could peacefully discuss, moving forward, like what we can do with the community. Read said he wanted to address protesters last night, “but it was just a lot of very, very, very angry people and it wasn’t maybe the safest time to do that.” Originally, there was a peaceful protest happening outside the restaurant, but that ended at about 6:45 p.m. Later in the night, more people gathered and it was during that gathering that people threw rocks at police officers, Fifth and Federal and the auto garage nextdoor. “We sincerely want to reach out and talk to the community leaders and sit down and figure out what we can do together to make this community stronger and better and not to have to damage and hurt one another,” continued Read. He said he’s not opposed to protests, but thinks what happened Sunday night got out of hand, “I think protests are fantastic. Peaceful protests, that’s what they were. I’m not sure why, but it just really, really spiraled out of control.”",0.0

The following day, Atlanta’s mayor two police officers were fired and three others placed on desk duty over excessive use of force during the arrest of Young and fellow college student Taniyah Pilgrim, seated in the passenger side of the car. (Atlanta Police Department via AP) ATLANTA (AP) — A college student dragged from a car by Atlanta police when she and her boyfriend were caught in traffic caused by a protest over the death of George Floyd said she feared the officers would kill them. “I still can’t even process what happened,” Taniyah Pilgrim said at a news conference Monday. “We felt like we were going to die in that car.” Dramatic body-camera video released by police shows a group of officers shouting orders, smashing the driver’s side window, deploying stun guns and pulling Pilgrim and Messiah Young from the sedan. Throughout, the couple can be heard screaming and asking officers what is happening. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a news conference Sunday after reviewing body camera footage that she and police Chief Erika Shields decided to immediately fire two of the officers involved and place three others on desk duty pending investigation. “Use of excessive force is never acceptable,” Bottoms told reporters. Shields called the footage “really shocking to watch.” Police identified the fired officers as Investigator Ivory Streeter, who was hired in December 2003, and Investigator Mark Gardner, hired in August 1997. Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said in a statement Monday that his office is in contact with Shields and is “moving rapidly to reach an appropriate charging decision.” Young, 22, of Chicago, is a rising senior at Morehouse, where he’s studying business management. Pilgrim, 20 — from San Antonio, Texas — is a psychology major at Spelman College. Both schools are historically black colleges near downtown Atlanta. Young suffered a fractured arm and required 20 stitches. He said the arrest was “one of the hardest things that I’ve ever experienced in my life.” The two were out getting something to eat Saturday night when they got snarled in traffic along Centennial Olympic Park in downtown Atlanta, their lawyers said. A friend of theirs, another Morehouse student, was standing in the street talking to them while they were stopped when police began to take him into custody, Young’s lawyer Mawuli Davis said. Young used his phone to film what was happening and that’s when officers turned on him, Davis said, adding he believes the officers’ motivation was to keep his client from capturing what was going on. Police on Sunday released video from seven officers’ body cameras. It shows the officers taking the other young man into custody as he pleads with them to let him go, saying he didn’t do anything. Young, behind the wheel of a car stopped in the street, is holding his phone up as an officer approaches and pulls his door open. Young pulls it shut and says repeatedly, “I’m not dying today.” He tells officers the other man is with them and urges them to release his friend and let him get in the car. The car advances and gets stuck in traffic as officers run up to both sides, shouting orders. An officer uses a stun gun on Pilgrim as she’s trying to get out, and officers pull her from the car. Another officer yells at Young to put the car in park and open the window. An officer repeatedly hits the driver’s side window with a baton, and another finally manages to break it. Officers also slashed the tires, the lawyers said. As the window glass shatters, an officer uses a stun gun on Young and officers pull him from the car as officers shout, “Get your hand out of your pockets,” and, “He got a gun. He got a gun. He got a gun.” Once he’s out and on the ground, officers zip tie his hands behind his back and lead him away. Police reports do not list a gun as having been recovered. Davis said Young has never been arrested and there was no gun or drugs in the car. “There is no justification, none whatsoever, for what they did to them and for what the system did to them,” Davis said, later adding, “If there was a gun, best believe this would have had a very different outcome.” In incident reports, Streeter wrote that he used his “electronic conductive weapon” on the driver and Gardner wrote that he deployed his Taser “to bring the female passenger under control.” Bottoms said Pilgrim was released without charges. She said Young was released, too, and she’s ordering charges against him dropped. A police report says he was charged with attempting to elude police and driving with a suspended license. Davis said criminal defense attorney Gary Spencer is working pro bono to make sure Young’s charges are dropped and to get the arrest wiped from his record so it doesn’t cause him problems later in life. L. Chris Stewart, an attorney representing Pilgrim, said they intend to file a lawsuit, saying cities often don’t make changes until they have to start writing checks. “We want change in policies, in procedures, in laws,” Stewart said. “It’s not hard to fix.” Training records from the Peace Officer Standards and Training Council, which certifies law enforcement officers in Georgia, show that Streeter and Gardner recently completed training in use of force and in deescalation tactics.",0.0

(Max Gersh/The Courier Journal via AP) LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Riot police firing tear gas scattered a protest crowd from a downtown Louisville square Monday night, hours after the firing of the city’s police chief in the uproar over the early morning shooting death of a popular restaurant owner by security forces. David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue spot who was known for offering meals to police officers, died while police and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew early Monday amid waves of protests over a previous police shooting in Kentucky’s largest city. Police said they were responding to gunfire from a crowd. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced the firing of Police Chief Steve Conrad at a news conference Monday. He said officers involved in the shooting failed to activate body cameras at the chaotic scene. Authorities had sought footage for their investigation, after Kentucky’s governor demanded the release of police video. “This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,” Fischer said. “Accordingly, I have relieved Steve Conrad of his duties as chief of Louisville Metro Police Department.” Gov. Andy Beshear later called the lack of body camera footage unacceptable. “This is the entire reason that we have those cameras,” the Democratic governor said at the state Capitol in Frankfort. Beshear authorized state police to independently investigate, promising the probe will be conducted in an “honest and transparent way that will not take months.” U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman announced that federal authorities will be part of the investigation. The governor said he had counted on body camera footage to help determine “the truth in a way that spoke for itself, at a time when trust is difficult and people deserve to be able to see and evaluate.” Late Monday afternoon, a huge group stretching several city blocks marched peacefully from downtown Louisville to the spot where McAtee was shot. Some motorists honked horns and raised fists in solidarity. Hundreds of protesters regrouped later Monday night at downtown Jefferson Square and riot police standing shoulder to shoulder advanced amid burts of fired tear gas, dispersing the crowd. Military-style vehicles could later be seen occupying the emptied-out square. The shakeup at the top of the city’s police department came a month earlier than expected. Conrad had previously announced his resignation, which was to take effect at the end of June. Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder will step in immediately as chief, Fischer said. The mayor also said the city’s curfew was being extended until June 8. Police did retrieve video from crime center cameras that showed how the shooting unfolded, Schroeder said. Two Louisville officers and two Guard soldiers returned fire, he said. The two officers violated policy by not wearing or activating body cameras, Schroeder said, adding they have been placed on administrative leave. McAtee, whose YaYa’s BBQ Shack is near where the shooting occurred, was mourned by hundreds. Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist and executive director of the group Game Changers, said McAtee was well-liked. “I’ve never known him to be aggressive in any kind of way,” he said. Schroeder agreed that McAtee was friendly to police officers. “Over the years he’s been a good friend to the police officers … frequently making sure our officers had a good meal on their shifts,” he said. Before his dismissal, Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. Monday outside a food market on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a group of curfew violators. Someone fired a shot at law enforcement officials, and both soldiers and officers returned fire, he said. Several “persons of interest” were being interviewed, he said. News outlets showed video taken by someone in a car parked at a gas station. It recorded the sound of bullets being fired as groups of police and Guard soldiers crouched behind cars. Kris Smith said he was at a restaurant — “just outside having a good time, having drinks, eating barbecue” — when the soldiers arrived. “As soon as I walk to my car they jump out with the sticks, the police jump out with their sticks and their shields and stuff on,” Smith said. “It looked like something out of a movie. It looked like a freaking war zone.” He said he heard a loud noise, then gunfire minutes later. Smith, who is black, said the group had nothing to do with the protests. Protesters have been demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home. After Taylor’s death, the mayor said Louisville police would be required to wear body cameras. ___ Associated Press contributors include Claire Galofaro and Rebecca Reynolds Yonker in Louisville.

Kia Yanna Monroe, one of the protesters, was out picking up trash along with others left behind in areas where protesters assembled. “I was here protesting on Saturday, and I just noticed that after the protest there’s a lot of garbage, a lot of bottles, a lot of stuff that’s on the ground. Just wanted to come out and clean up a little bit,” she said. “I think it’s important. I understand why everybody’s out here. I’m part of it, but I also think our city needs to be cleaned too,” she said. Monroe said it’s “just the right thing to do,” and that other people were out cleaning during the weekend. She said all the violence and looting was hard to see since the protests are supposed to be peaceful. “It was a little rough being down here cause some people are using the Black Lives Matter in a very negative way, trying to cause more commotion that it needs to be, she said. “It’s supposed to be peaceful protests, and some people turning it into making it become violent which is not the answer.” Everybody, especially police, she said, needs to sit down and talk about how to move forward. “Clearly, conversation needs to be had,” she said. “Everybody needs to listen to each other, especially the cops. They way they’re handling it now, I don’t think is the right way cause you are shooting at us, macing us. You are tear-gassing us when all we’re trying to do is peacefully protest and wanting somebody to listen to us.” Across downtown, on Congress Ave. Kelly Johnson and her daughter Daphne had the same idea. “I was very supportive of the protests, but I just didn’t like the way the city was left,” Johnson said. She runs IREP, an Austin-based junk hauling company that donates items people leave behind to those in need. She and Daphne planned to use their equipment to help haul away trash, as well. However, by the time they got downtown Monday, others like Monroe had already finished most of that work. “We realized that there was not a lot of trash to pick up, but we saw all the graffiti. And, so, we pivoted,” Johnson said. She and her daughter picked up some graffiti removal spray and spent the day scrubbing off spray paint in front of businesses. Seeing it through the eyes of her mom, who runs a small business of her own, Daphne urged people to think about who vandalism and looting is actually hurting. “I get why people are angry. They have every right to be,” Daphne said. “But when you damage things that have nothing to do with it, like who knows if these people who run this might be totally with you. Damaging their property isn’t going to make it…it just doesn’t help anything. It doesn’t prove a point. It just makes people mad.” Johnson added that’s especially true in the middle of a pandemic. “The businesses have suffered so much already, and it’s like they didn’t need this on top of it, you know?” The mother-daughter pair plans to keep working throughout the week and is inviting others to help. “Cause Daphne and I, were pretty fit, but there’s only so much we can do by ourselves,” Johnson smiled. The Johnsons say anyone who would like to help can reach out to them through their company’s contact form. “We’ll just keep working until we can get this city back to, you know, showing it off again,” Johnson said.",0.0

President Donald Trump had announced he would soon be addressing the nation from the White House Rose Garden, as a 7 p.m. curfew in the city loomed and a mass of law enforcement, including U.S. Secret Service agents, Park Police and National Guardsmen, stood sentry, many dressed in riot gear. Moments before 6:30 p.m., just when Trump said he would begin his address, the officers suddenly marched forward, directly confronting the protesters as many held up their hands, saying, “Don’t shoot."" Soon, law enforcement officers were aggressively forcing the protesters back, firing tear gas and deploying flash bangs into the crowd to disperse them from the park for seemingly no reason. It was a jarring scene as police in the nation's capital forcefully cleared young men and women gathered legally in a public park on a sunny evening, all of it on live television. With smoke still wafting and isolated tussles continuing in the crowd, Trump emerged in the Rose Garden for a dramatic split-screen of his own creation. “I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,"" he declared, before demanding that governors across the nation deploy the National Guard ""in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets."" And he warned that, if they refused, he would deploy the United States military “and quickly solve the problem for them.” As an additional show of force, Trump announced he was deploying even more of the military to Washington, D.C., giving it the feel of an armed, locked-down city after days of violent clashes, arson and looting. “As we speak I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers,"" he said, as explosions rang out in the background. “We are putting everybody on warning.” Then, before departing, Trump announced he wasn't done for the evening, and would be ""going to pay my respects to a very very special place.” Moments later, the White House press pool was quickly summoned for a surprise movement. And soon after, Trump strolled out of the White House gates — something he had never done before — and walked across the park that had just been cleared to accommodate his movements. Trump walked slowly, followed by an entourage of his most senior aides, security and reporters. The faint residue of pepper spray hung in the air, stinging eyes and prompting coughing. Sections of the park and surrounding sidewalks were strewn with garbage, including plastic water bottles and other debris. Some sections had been scrawled with graffiti. Trump crossed H Street and walked toward St. John’s Church, the landmark pale yellow building where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, then raised a black-covered Bible for reporters to see. “We have a great country,” Trump said. “Greatest country in the world.” He didn’t talk about Floyd, the church or the damage it had suffered, or the peaceful protesters police had cleared. He said nothing about the coronavirus pandemic, the parallel crisis that has continued to ravage the nation as Trump campaigns for a second presidential term. And then he invited his attorney general, national security adviser, chief of staff, press secretary and defense secretary — all white — to join him for another round of photos before he walked back across the park to the White House. At one point, he stopped and pumped his fist in the air at National Guard members in the distance. “We’re going to keep it nice and safe,"" he said. Rabbi Jack Moline, the president of Interfaith Alliance, slammed the fact that peaceful protesters near the White House were gassed and shot with rubber bullets so Trump could hold his photo op. “Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice — right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area — is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,"" Moline said in a statement. This only underscores the president’s complete lack of compassion for Black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism.” And the Right Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, to which St. John’s belongs, said she was “outraged” by the moment and noted that Trump didn't pray during his visit. “He took the symbols sacred to our tradition and stood in front of a house of prayer in full expectation that would be a celebratory moment,” Budde told The Associated Press. “There was nothing I could do but speak out against that.”",0.0

Trump's Rose Garden remarks came as just across the street, law enforcement officers deployed tear gas and shot rubber bullets to forcefully disperse peaceful protesters. Washington, D.C., had set a curfew Monday of 7 p.m. ET. The protesters were removed from the Lafayette Square area across from the White House, apparently to clear the way for the president to walk to St. John's Church, where he posed briefly for photographers, holding a Bible. Parts of the church compound were damaged by rioters on Sunday night. In a statement, Judd Deere, the White House's deputy press secretary, said: ""The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m. curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation's most historic churches the night before. Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" Trump's remarks, which lasted less than seven minutes, came after days of protests in dozens of cities across the U.S. following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis a week ago. During the remarks, Trump declared himself ""a law-and-order president"" and ""ally of all peaceful protesters,"" but he called violent unrest that has accompanied many demonstrations ""acts of domestic terror."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life, and the spilling of innocent blood, is an offense to humanity and a crime against God,"" Trump said. He added: ""Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence."" Trump said he had mobilized ""thousands and thousands"" of ""heavily armed"" military personnel to put an end to the protests, which were born from criticisms of excessive force by law enforcement. It was not immediately clear, however, what precise changes might be in store for the personnel who have been responding to the demonstrations across the country. The Justice Department said in a statement that beginning Monday night, it had deployed all of its law enforcement components and is coordinating with the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and local authorities to ""maximize federal security presence throughout the District [of Columbia]."" Threatening state governors who have declined to deploy the National Guard, Trump said he would dispatch the U.S. military to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" After the stop at St. John's Church, Trump and a retinue of advisers and staffers then returned to the secure enclave within the White House complex. Nation in crisis Protests, which have at times broken out into violence and looting, continued from the weekend into Monday, following the video-recorded death of Floyd, who died after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protesters — many of whom have worn masks because of the coronavirus pandemic — have demanded that the officers involved be held accountable for Floyd's death. Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers who were involved in the incident have been fired but have not been charged. Several major cities, including Washington, D.C., were placed under curfews following the unrest. Trump's walk to the nearby church, which he does not typically visit, technically violated the District of Columbia's Monday curfew for a little time. The National Guard has been deployed in many states, and the president on Monday called for governors to ""dominate"" in their states to put an end to the protests. His remarks Monday stand in stark contrast to the position he took toward heavily armed majority-white protesters last month, who stormed the Michigan statehouse in defiance of stay-at-home orders to demand a reopening of the state economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump described those protesters as ""very good people"" and called on the governor to ""give a little"" to appease them. The protests against police violence come against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S., with black Americans disproportionately affected.

In some cities police chiefs joined the demonstrations. HAMPTON, Va. — As tensions rise across the country, there's a sense of unity across Hampton Roads. That was shown over the weekend, despite unrest in Virginia Beach. Police chiefs stood among crowds that were demanding action. Newport News Police Chief Steve Drew, Portsmouth Police Chief Angela Greene and Hampton Police Chief Terry Sult each believe the protests that remained peaceful across Hampton Roads were a result of the relationships and trust they've built with their communities. All three joined different demonstrations over the weekend. The three of them were also together Sunday night at a ""Justice Rally"" in Newport News. Each Chief said they are committed to doing everything possible to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening. Chief Greene said she will use the video of Floyd on the ground for training within her department to show unacceptable use of force. The Newport News Police Department will revisit existing policies. The Hampton Police Division will continue to mandate the highest quality training in professional policing especially in de-escalation and critical incident management. All three offered an apology to George Floyd’s family. “I am proud of our citizens who had a voice, we respected that, and they respected property and life,” Chief Drew said. “We hear you, after today let's have these talks, how we can show you we support you and that we are here to protect and serve,” Chief Greene said. “These are the kind of events we need to have, expressing your voice, coming together in unity to solve a problem,” Chief Sult said. There was another group of protesters that tried to keep the peace, but things took a turn Sunday. Members with Black Lives Matter 757 said they were not responsible for the destruction that took place in Virginia Beach.

(WAVY) — Right now, each police department has to figure out how to keep protests peaceful – while making sure those participating feel their voices are being heard. In Norfolk, where there have been no arrests connected to protests, they’ve chosen to support demonstrators with police escorts and also a listening ear. Saturday, a crowd of hundreds’ journey through Norfolk had an unexpected twist. There was the sadness of the moment that another black man’s life has been reduced to a hashtag. There was anger and frustration from making that walk before. But then there was a special exchange. Unbeknownst to them, Chief Larry Boone was nearby but unseen for an hour as more people joined. The riot team was ready, but he said no. He didn’t want that to be the narrative there. “Within moments I was surrounded by 350 people plus,” said Norfolk Police Chief Larry Boone. “I got caught up by multiple questions and I tried to field as many questions as I could. I might’ve answered 30-40 questions for various people. They have been non-violent. There hadn’t been any damage. And they were a model for the world to see.” Peaceful albeit understandably disturbed. They are people in pain wondering if Rodney King’s fight proceeded Eric Garner’s pleas for air and it still leads us to hearing George Floyd beg, wondering if his last breath will finally be the catalyst for change. Boone says yes. “They are expressing their grievances and their grievances are real,” said Boone. “They are very emotional in these surreal times, times that I haven’t seen in 30 years. You saw a man killed for public consumption for the whole world to see. And it pains me to think that some loved one would see that, to see the life leave his body as he cried out for his mother.” “We need to have real progress and I have no doubt after this because I’ve never seen anything like it there will be real police reform.” Boone fully expects more protests until all of the officers involved in George Floyd’s death are arrested and charged. He says a part of the challenge for police departments moving forward will be trying to encourage the good officers, weed out the bad and navigate a major recruiting challenge at a time when you really need the best people on board. 10 on your side talked to Norfolk Police Chief Larry Boone about the importance of being a part of this effort right now as well. “It’s important that they see us in a different light,” said Boone. “And I know that’s just fleeting in the moment. But at least it’s an opportunity to be doing something productive and positive that serves as a benefit for those who have been impacted by this COVID-19.” Latest Posts",0.0

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — George Floyd’s brother pleaded for peace in the streets Monday, saying destruction is “not going to bring my brother back at all.” Terrence Floyd’s emotional plea came as the United States braced for another night of violence in response to Floyd’s killing a week ago. Chants of “What’s his name? George Floyd!” filled the air as a large crowd gathered at the spot where the black man who became the latest symbol of racial injustice in America lay handcuffed and dying as a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck. Wearing a face mask with Floyd’s image on it, his brother dropped to his knees at the storefront that has been turned into a memorial covered with flowers and signs. As he kneeled silently, many who were around him joined him on the ground. The memorial site was a space of calm compared to the devastation left in the wake of fires and violence that paralyzed the city for days last week before it spread nationwide. “I understand y’all are upset. I doubt y’all are half as upset as I am,” said Terrence Floyd, who lives in New York. “So if I’m not over here blowing up stuff, if I’m not over here messing up my community, then what are y’all doing? What are y’all doing? Y’all doing nothing. Because that’s not going to bring my brother back at all.” George Floyd, 46, died last week after he was arrested in Minneapolis, accused of using a forged $20 bill to pay for goods at a grocery store. The white officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with murder. Terrence Floyd took several minutes sitting in the spot where the officer pinned his brother, and he sobbed. Addressing the crowd, he said he did not understand why the other three police officers who arrested Floyd and were fired with Chauvin have not been charged. Still, he said, the Floyd family, which he described as “peaceful” and “God-fearing,” wants calm protests at this time with hopes that justice will follow. “In every case of police brutality, the same thing has been happening. Y’all protest, y’all destroy stuff. … Let’s do this another way,” he said, encouraging the crowd to vote and to educate themselves. “Let’s switch it up, y’all.” In contrast to the peaceful message, President Donald Trump took a tough tone later in the day in the White House Rose Garden, threatening to mobilize “thousands and thousands” of U.S. soldiers if state governors don’t deploy the National Guard to “dominate the streets” and halt the protests. As he spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding just a block away as police and National Guard soldiers worked to force people protesting the death of Floyd back. Before his death, George Floyd — like millions of Americans during the coronavirus pandemic — was out of work and looking for a new job. He and some friends moved to Minneapolis from his native Houston around 2014 to find work and start a new life, his lifelong friend Christopher Harris has said. But he was laid off when Minnesota shut down restaurants as part of a stay-at-home order. “My brother moved here from Houston. He loved it here,” Terrence Floyd said Monday. “So I know he would not want y’all to be doing this.” He said he appreciates the show of support and love for his brother and their family. Civil rights leader Rev. Kevin McCall of New York, said he brought Terrence Floyd, community members and others out to the memorial site in Minneapolis to urge calm. “We’re sending a message to people all over the country,” he said. “Stop the looting and throw up the peace sign. Don’t stop protesting, but throw up the peace sign.” At the end of his remarks, Terrence Floyd led the crowd in more chants. “What’s his name?” he said. “George Floyd!” the crowd answered back. ___ Morrison is a member of the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) WASHINGTON (AP) — It began with Attorney General Bill Barr standing with his hands casually in his pockets, not wearing a tie, surveying the scene at Lafayette Park across from the White House, where several thousand protesters had gathered for more demonstrations after the police killing of George Floyd. President Donald Trump had announced he would soon be addressing the nation from the White House Rose Garden, as a 7 p.m. curfew in the city loomed and a mass of law enforcement, including U.S. Secret Service agents, Park Police and National Guardsmen, stood sentry, many dressed in riot gear. Moments before 6:30 p.m., just when Trump said he would begin his address, the officers suddenly marched forward, directly confronting the protesters as many held up their hands, saying, “Don’t shoot.” Soon, law enforcement officers were aggressively forcing the protesters back, firing tear gas and deploying flash bangs into the crowd to disperse them from the park for seemingly no reason. It was a jarring scene as police in the nation’s capital forcefully cleared young men and women gathered legally in a public park on a sunny evening, all of it on live television. With smoke still wafting and isolated tussles continuing in the crowd, Trump emerged in the Rose Garden for a dramatic split-screen of his own creation. “I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,” he declared, before demanding that governors across the nation deploy the National Guard “in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets.” And he warned that, if they refused, he would deploy the United States military “and quickly solve the problem for them.” As an additional show of force, Trump announced he was deploying even more of the military to Washington, D.C., giving it the feel of an armed, locked-down city after days of violent clashes, arson and looting. “As we speak I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers,” he said, as explosions rang out in the background. “We are putting everybody on warning.” Then, before departing, Trump announced he wasn’t done for the evening, and would be “going to pay my respects to a very very special place.” Moments later, the White House press pool was quickly summoned for a surprise movement. And soon after, Trump strolled out of the White House gates — something he had never done before — and walked across the park that had just been cleared to accommodate his movements. Trump walked slowly, followed by an entourage of his most senior aides, security and reporters. The faint residue of pepper spray hung in the air, stinging eyes and prompting coughing. Sections of the park and surrounding sidewalks were strewn with garbage, including plastic water bottles and other debris. Some sections had been scrawled with graffiti. Trump crossed H Street and walked toward St. John’s Church, the landmark pale yellow building where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, then raised a black-covered Bible for reporters to see. “We have a great country,” Trump said. “Greatest country in the world.” He didn’t talk about Floyd, the church or the damage it had suffered, or the peaceful protesters police had cleared. He said nothing about the coronavirus pandemic, the parallel crisis that has continued to ravage the nation as Trump campaigns for a second presidential term. And then he invited his attorney general, national security adviser, chief of staff, press secretary and defense secretary — all white — to join him for another round of photos before he walked back across the park to the White House. At one point, he stopped and pumped his fist in the air at National Guard members in the distance. “We’re going to keep it nice and safe,” he said. Rabbi Jack Moline, the president of Interfaith Alliance, slammed the fact that peaceful protesters near the White House were gassed and shot with rubber bullets so Trump could hold his photo op. “Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice — right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area — is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,” Moline said in a statement. This only underscores the president’s complete lack of compassion for Black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism.” And the Right Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, to which St. John’s belongs, said she was “outraged” by the moment and noted that Trump didn’t pray during his visit. “He took the symbols sacred to our tradition and stood in front of a house of prayer in full expectation that would be a celebratory moment,” Budde told The Associated Press. “There was nothing I could do but speak out against that.”",0.0

He never thought he'd get a chance to fight back, let alone make it out alive. But on Monday, Soltan, a 32-year-old U.S. citizen now living in Virginia, used a federal statute to accuse former Egyptian prime minister Hazem el-Beblawi of crimes against humanity. The 1991 Torture Victims Protection Act allows for victims of torture and extrajudicial killings committed by foreign officials abroad to seek justice through the American court system. It's the first such case against an Egyptian official, made possible by the grim coincidence that el-Beblawi now lives just miles from Soltan, in Washington, where he is an executive director of the International Monetary Fund. 'He's completely gotten away with it, and is walking free downtown,' Soltan said. 'I just want to regain some of the justice and dignity stripped away from me.' El-Beblawi, contacted through the IMF, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the summer of 2013, after the military-led ouster of the country's first democratically elected but divisive president, Mohamed Morsi, Egyptian security officers descended on a protest camp packed with his Islamist supporters, killing hundreds. Soltan, an Ohio State graduate and the son of a prominent member of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, was shot in the arm while working as a stringer for Western news organizations in Rabaa al-Adawiya Square. Before long he was picked up by security forces. In a mass trial widely condemned by human rights groups, Soltan was sentenced to life in prison on charges of spreading 'fake news"" to tarnish Egypt's image. In the maximum-security Tora prison complex, Soltan says he endured unspeakable torments overseen by el-Beblawi and other high-ranking officers. He says he was denied medical care for his festering bullet wound, beaten to unconsciousness, held in solitary confinement and forced to listen to the sounds of his father being tortured in a nearby cell. He lost 160 pounds over the course of a 16-month hunger strike to protest his unjust imprisonment. Under pressure from the Obama administration, Egypt released Soltan in 2015, although his father remains in prison. He has attempted to build a new life in Virginia, advocating for fellow political prisoners still in Egypt and pursuing a master's degree at Georgetown University. But memories from his dark cell in Tora still haunt him. 'There's this perpetual, compounded trauma every single day,' he said, 'where you get up and look in the mirror and see the scars and cigarette burns and the bullet marks...it changes you.' Eric Lewis, a lawyer with Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss, who represents Soltan, says he hopes the case sends a message to Egypt's government 'that they cannot commit crimes against humanity and then seek haven in the United States.' An estimated 60,000 political prisoners languish in Egypt's jails, according to Human Rights Watch, including many journalists and critics held on vague terrorism charges without trial. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who came to power in 2013, has waged an unprecedented crackdown on dissent. The lawsuit lists el-Sissi, intelligence chief Abbas Kamel and three other former senior security officials as culpable, saying that they can be served if they set foot in the United States.",0.0

William",http://www.insidenova.com/news/prince_william/,"Manassas native Laz Holmes stood in front of the Wawa on Liberia Avenue holding a “Black Lives Matter” sign for hours Sunday afternoon, raising his fist as cars drove by and honked. Surrounded by peaceful demonstrators nearly a week after the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, the 27-year-old Holmes said he’d had enough. “We’re feeling hurt to be honest with you,” he said. “It took a lot to get us this way … years and years. Ever since I’ve been growing up I’ve been getting harassed, first hand racism, too many times. Everybody’s just hurt. It’s time to take a stand for something and the time is now.” The peaceful protest against police violence brought hundreds to the Wawa parking lot, including the police chiefs in Manassas and Prince William County. Both spoke to the crowd and took a knee in solidarity with those gathered. The message from speakers and others was simple: black lives matter and the killing of black people by police must stop. The peaceful protest Sunday followed a protest Saturday on Sudley Road near the city that ended with five arrests and seven officers injured. According to Prince William County Deputy Police Chief Jarad Phelps, law enforcement used chemical agents and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd Saturday night. Five people were arrested and five businesses were damaged. But many came Sunday afternoon to help ensure peace. Michelle Livingston had come with a group from Chapel Springs Church. They’d joined to both amplify the message of the protests and try to bring some organization to the proceedings. “I’m here for the church first, and to keep the peace so we’re not in the news like the rest of the city. We just want peace, we want a peaceful protest, but I can feel the vibe that some young people want to start something,” Livingston said. “We want to remember black lives matter, and that’s what we’re here for. Black lives matter. And we’re going to do it in peace, we’re not going to have the violence.” Both Phelps and Manassas Police Chief Douglas Keen said they were deeply hurt by what they saw in the video of Floyd’s death — a white police officer holding his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd pleaded for air and slowly lost consciousness. In speaking to the crowd, the two chiefs touted the steps their respective departments had taken to build relationships and trust in their communities. Speaking with a reporter, the two said there was no room in their department’s for officers like Derek Chauvin, the man who pinned Floyd to the ground. “We’re angry. We’re frustrated. We don’t feel that these kinds of people should be in our profession either, we want them out,” Keen said. “If your heart’s not in the right place and you don’t have a kind heart, wanting to help people, move on, find another job, this is not the progression for you. I know I speak for [Prince William police] as well, we’d rather have a vacancy than have a bad apple on the force. So move on if that’s the kind of police work you want to do.” But as the afternoon turned to evening, Sosa L. said the sympathy from local cops was not enough for many. He was worried that frustrations would once again turn into violence later in the evening. “Everybody’s tired of the injustice and inequality. We’re trying to come together as one and get on the same page and stop all the madness that’s been going on. It should [stay peaceful], you don’t get anything done doing something like that, so it should stay peaceful,” he said. Pastor TJ Denman, the young adult pastor at Chapel Springs Church in Bristow, had brought church members there for just that reason. Handing out pizza bought by a group of churches in the area as the sun began to set, he said he was frustrated with recent instances of police brutality, but was also wary of what might come once the darkness set in. “Last night, it was a lot of young people out — there weren't a lot of people coming alongside and helping to guide at that point when stuff started to get worse and it started to turn,” Denman said. “People need help leading and I really believe that’s what the church is called to do. It’s called to step in and help communicate between the authorities and people and stand in the gap.” But he also said he too was fed up with police brutality and racism. “I really feel like with the way Ahmaud Arbery happened and Breonna Taylor and Amy Cooper and George Floyd, the way it happened back to back to back to back, people are finally starting to say, ‘You know what? We can’t just sit back anymore.’ We need to capitalize on this and not just let it fade into the background.” As frustrated and hurt as he said he was, Holmes said he was also hopeful. With two children, he said he has no choice but to be. “I hope it changes. But it starts with us,” Holmes said. “Like racism, racism is taught. Hopefully it can be untaught.”",0.0

William",http://www.insidenova.com/news/prince_william/,"A peaceful protest with roughly 500 people was held at Monday evening at Virginia Gateway. Police reported that the crowd required officers to divert traffic for several hours as the crowd moved around the area. Protest events Monday in Northern Virginia were part of an ongoing response to the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer last week. At the earlier protest in Gainesville, Charles Clements said he is concerned about his two adult sons and his baby grandson. “I’m really concerned about their place in the world and in this country,” Clements said. His wife, Lisa Clements, said the video of George Floyd’s killing was shocking. “We actually saw another human being murdered in front of our eyes, George Floyd,” she said. “This has really shattered me to my core, to actually have seen this.” She said she saw a neighbor post online that Black Lives Matter protesters were thugs – a term President Donald Trump has called those protesting after George Floyd’s killing. “That’s another reason why I’m here,” she said. “People will say it was unlawful and dangerous, I’ll be able to say ‘No, I was there and you weren’t.’” Dale City resident Brandyn Munford held a sign he made for the protest: “Day 80: Breonna Taylor’s murderers are not in jail! #sayhername.” Breonna Taylor was fatally shot by law enforcement in her home March 13. “She wasn’t doing anything but sleeping,” Munford said. Manassas resident Gimara Richards said she wants justice and equality for all people. She said the video of Floyd's death was disturbing because the police officers did not help Floyd as he struggle to breath. ""I think we're fed up,"" she said. A teacher at Freedom High School, Richards said she attended the protest Monday to support her son and her students. Rev. Cozy Bailey, president of the Prince William Chapter of the NAACP, told the crowd of protestors that this is showing the best of the county. “This is a beautiful site,” he said. A protest briefly blocked traffic on Interstate 66 in the Fairfax area shortly after 5 p.m., reported Dave Dildine with WTOP. 'Planning for the worst and hoping for the best' In Manassas, 200-300 protesters were at the Prince William County Courthouse, leading police to ask residents to avoid the area. At 5:09 p.m., police reported roads in Old Town Manassas would be closed as protesters moved through around the courthouse area. By 6:30, police reported that only small groups remained from the protest and it had remained peaceful throughout its entirety. Earlier, protesters at the courthouse held signs and chanting among other slogans “Black lives matter,” “No justice, no peace,” the afternoon demonstration remained peaceful despite a few tense moments between protest leaders and the Prince William County Sheriff's Office deputies. In the middle of the demonstration at the courthouse, protesters presented Prince William County Sheriff Glen Hill with a pledge to sign that if, at any point, his officers shot an unarmed black man, he would step down. After a long back-and-forth, Hill declined to do so as his officers maintained a perimeter around the courthouse. Niki Wilson, a 21-year-old from Manassas, said she was there to peacefully demand change, but saw that some in the crowd wanted to take a more confrontational approach. “That’s not why I’m out here. I’m out here because I know there’s cops here and all over that abuse their power. Just because you saw one, there’s a lot more, and we need to change that,” Wilson told InsideNoVa. “Some people out here say they want to fight. I want to fight but with my voice. Nothing good going to come from destroying things.” At times, various speakers alternated between a message of peace and a message of broader defiance. As some tried to engage Hill in a conversation while holding firm in their demand that he sign the pledge, others said they shouldn’t be trying to work with law enforcement at all. At the Manassas City Council meeting Monday night, Police Chief Douglas Keen told the council that he wouldn’t be signing any documents. “None of us are going to sign a blank statement like that,” Keen said. “I will be glad to stand before your crowd and have a conversation to answer the questions you have. [There was] no desire to have a conversation. There is a group in the crowd that’s trying to antagonize the rest of them. We are planning for the worst and hoping for the best.” Keen did not recommend that Manassas institute a curfew, though he said that may change tomorrow. On Sunday night, after a long and peaceful demonstration, there was a confrontation between Manasssas police officers and a smaller group of demonstrators. Glory Days Grill sustained some property damage and the state police were called in to protect the Manassas police station. There was also some looting at a nearby Walmart, but Keen said his officers did not deploy any tear gas or rubber bullets, and ultimately the demonstration cleared relatively peacefully. Four arrests were made at the Walmart by Prince William County police. “Our tactics were holding the line, we’re not going to deploy any gas or munitions because that’s what they’re looking for to justify more violence,” Keen told the council “They got tired of us and bored and began to disperse … All of us in law enforcement went home uninjured. No arrests, no protesters hurt or touched by us.” Previous coverage",0.0

The protest remained peaceful for the majority of the night, with chants of “no justice, no peace” and “black lives matter.” Black Lives Matter 757 started at 7:57 p.m. at Rudee Loop and 1st Street. People of all races united and marched for more than two dozen blocks. But shortly before 10 p.m. tensions began to rise when hundreds of protesters began to surround a police cruiser that was blocking traffic at 5th Street and Pacific Avenue. “The police car for some reason or another pretty much ran and drove and moved through the crowd and actually hit a pregnant lady,” Jones said. “From that point emotions ran a little high.” It was following that point that businesses started to be vandalized by groups that appeared to have broken off from the main protest. The group Jones was with continued back to 16th and Atlantic Avenue, where the Virginia Beach Police Department met them with riot gear. There, several officers kneeled in solidarity. “I even asked for the megaphone so I could announce to the large crowd ‘Hey, we are going to be taking a knee. If not for nine seconds, nine minutes, and then we are going to go ahead and head out,'” Jones said. During this time as we are coordinating this with Virginia Beach Police. All [of] a sudden we see a SWAT attire coming with an intent to flank us, and that got emotions of everybody riled up because we felt as if we were being hoodwinked.” In a press conference on Monday afternoon, Acting Police Chief Tony Zucaro said some members of the crowd starting throwing projectiles at officers and breaking windows of storefronts. Organizers say it was evident outside troublemakers infiltrated what they were trying to do. Jones could be seen on the Facebook Live telling protesters to go home. “We are not here to just break this down, we are not here to loot. A lot of the people doing the damages, they were white people, not black people,” said Jackie Horton, who helps lead Black Lives Matter 757. “If people cared as much about black lives as much as those businesses, we wouldn’t be here.” Black Lives Matter 757 said they are working on a plan to help some of the nearly 50 businesses that were damaged. “We would attempt to [help] if there are any struggling businesses that would maybe need some assistance. We are putting together some formulation. We don’t appreciate what is going on but we do have some compassion as well,” Jones said. Black Lives Matter 757 is asking for a meeting with the police chiefs of all seven cities of Hampton Roads to talk about how to move forward with establishing a citizen review board that would work to better hold officers accountable. They also say they want to see how police officer candidates with complaints in other departments are vetted. The group said they planned to continue to protest. “It was not pretty at the Oceanfront, it was really bad,” Horton said. “However, I’d do it over again because there will be no peace until there is justice.” Latest Posts",0.0

(WAVY) – 10 On Your Side is gathering more public reaction to an incident Sunday night at the Virginia Beach Oceanfront involving a red pickup truck that was driven into the middle of a group of protesters. Video captured live by Chopper 10 Sunday night showed a red pickup truck flying American flags and driving down Atlantic Avenue, narrowly missing protesters, some of whom could be seen hitting the truck with objects, kicking the truck and pulling on the flags. Protest organizers tell 10 On Your Side that the driver of that truck was aggressive before the incident. 10 On Your Side has also been sent videos from social media showing the driver yelling at the crowd while outside his truck and later revving his truck’s engine before driving near the protesters. Other videos sent to 10 On Your Side show the truck driving near the protesters from other vantage points. During a press briefing Monday afternoon, Virginia Beach Interim Police Chief Tony Zucaro told the media his department was trying to find the driver the red truck captured on video. Zucaro said: “Right now, we are still looking for that vehicle. If anyone in the community is aware of who the operator or the occupants of that vehicle are, I would encourage them to call our detective bureau.” The driver, who only would only use his first name, “Manny”, reached out Monday morning to 10 On Your Side to give his side of the story. Manny admitted he was not there to support the Black Lives Matter movement, but claimed he was there to shout praise for the police. 10 On Your Side spoke with protest organizers Aubrey Japharii Jones and Jackie Horton who were at the Oceanfront Sunday night. “We were (not) attacking them. This individual revved his engine far from us, and we alerted everybody about the loud engine in order to clear everyone out,” Jones said. “If you’re running down the street, and yelling racial slurs to people, and you can see there’s a protest then obviously you want trouble. Of course people are going to get upset. This is a protest. It is very clear what we are doing. You (Manny) shouldn’t even been on the street, which you were,” Horton said. Manny told 10 On Your Side he had every right to be there, and admits he was argumentative with the protesters. Jones says Manny crossed the line and created a hostile environment. “He goes back and revs his engine, and gases it towards us, not only once, but multiple times,” Horton said. “He did a full circle, and came back. It was intentional.” Manny maintains that he never meant to hurt anyone. 10 On Your Side called Manny to get comment on the protest organizers’ account of events and the videos showing what happened before the incident, but we have not heard back.

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — Virginia Beach Police enforced a new curfew at the Oceanfront on Monday night, clearing streets that were filled with protesters on Sunday night. Still, some people showed up in small groups to peacefully protest systemic racism. They said the fight isn’t over, even with restrictions. Police started enforcing the curfew around 9 p.m. Officers said they would issue a warning first, then a summons, and then make an arrest on a third violation, if needed. The curfew comes after a peaceful protest against racism and police brutality later turned to chaos and some rioting. Monday night, Kelli Thomas accompanied two of her sons to protest at the Oceanfront once again. They held ""Black Lives Matter"" signs. “I worry that they might not get home someday because some cop decided their lives don’t matter,” Thomas said. ""It's time for the violence to end."" As the curfew started at 8 p.m., other isolated protesters at the Oceanfront spoke out against racism and police violence. “An 8 o'clock curfew and I’m still here because our generation needs to take charge at this point,"" said Mark Gower. ""Clearly people aren’t doing anything, we cannot go home until reform has happened.” Some businesses at the Oceanfront are boarded up after windows and doors were shattered in Sunday’s rioting. A few hung signs in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, despite the damage. “I’m tired of injustice and something needs to change and that’s why we need to make noise... but do it the right way, of course,"" said Joshua Ruiz.

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) WASHINGTON – Officials in the nation’s capital pushed back Tuesday on an aggressive response by the federal government to demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, with the mayor flatly rejecting a Trump administration proposal for the federal government to take over its police force and one county in Virginia pulling its officers from Washington. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies, and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr, who is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city, promised by Tuesday “even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region."" District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said the Trump administration floated the idea of taking over the Metropolitan Police Department, a proposal she strongly rejected. She threatened to take legal action if the federal government attempted to do so. But there were signs that the federal response would be even more aggressive Tuesday night, as Washington prepared for a fifth night of protests. Hours before a 7 p.m. curfew for the second night in a row, cars were being stopped at military checkpoints in downtown Washington and a cavalry of armored military vehicles could be seen driving through the district. Businesses were boarding up windows with plywood in anticipation of another night of violence after fires were set, windows were shattered, store shelves were emptied and dozens of police officers were injured in days of protests. Two Defense Department officials said the Trump administration had ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a “show of force” against demonstrators protesting the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Police made over 300 arrests, mainly for violating the district’s curfew. Earlier Monday evening, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback moved aggressively to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Donald Trump’s walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, Arlington County in Virginia pulled out its officers, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she’s “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was abused “for a photo op.” In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have aided each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in Washington on Saturday and Sunday without incident. Arlington County officials said in a statement their officers never wielded their batons and did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas. But after watching the scene unfold on live television, the police chief ordered all the officers to return to Virginia. “This unprecedented decision by the County was a necessary response to an unprecedented situation,” the statement said. Officials said they were reevaluating the mutual aid agreements to ensure officers “are never again put in a situation where they are asked to take action that is inconsistent with our values.” The U.S. Park Police on Tuesday defended its actions at the park, saying it issued three warnings over a loudspeaker before clearing the area of protesters, some of whom they said were becoming violent, throwing projectiles and trying to grab weapons. It said it used smoke canisters and pepper balls to disperse the crowd. Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear the park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, ahead of the president's remarks, leading to police using force to disperse protesters, a person familiar with the matter told the AP. Officials had met Monday morning and decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block, which was expected to happen by Monday afternoon, after multiple fires were set in the park the night before, the person said. When Barr arrived, he was surprised it hadn’t been done and directed action to be taken, according to the person, who could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Monday, in a call with governors, Trump and Barr had encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country. The call raised questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, a White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was if they don’t utilize all of the tools in their arsenal they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response from Washington if they request federal dollars to help with clean-up and recovery down the line. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized in Washington. The Justice Department had deployed agents from every one of its agencies, including the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, and riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other Homeland Security agencies were also dispatched. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. The U.S. military and National Guard are operating in Washington under the official mission name Operation Themis, according to two Pentagon officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so publicly. In Greek mythology, Themis was a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. Army Lt. Col. Chris Mitchell, a Pentagon spokesperson, said they were not aware of the operational name but said it’s possible. The Associated Press reviewed a Defense Department document that showed the DC response is under the banner of Operation Themis.

Part of the church was set on fire during protests on Sunday night. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) WASHINGTON – Claiming he is backed by a “silent majority,"" President Donald Trump turned the nation’s capital into a model for the overwhelming force he believes critical to stop sometimes-violent protests that have spread across the country in a time of racial unrest. His tactics were decried Tuesday by some fellow Republicans as well as his presumptive Democratic opponent. The violent dispersal of peaceful protests near the White House the night before was a potent symbol of Trump's policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Moments after historic Lafayette Park was cleared, Trump walked across to pose with a Bible in front of a church damaged by fire during protests the previous evening. “D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination,” Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added: “(thank you President Trump!).” The president wanted to make the aggressive action in the nation’s capital — where he wields disproportionate powers — an example for the rest of the country, a senior White House official said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss internal thinking. Trump hoped his personal walk to the church, after federal officials dispersed protesters, would send a message about how dominant force could restore law and order. The president has threatened that if states do not take tough enough action, he will deploy active duty military across the country to quell unrest in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “SILENT MAJORITY!” Trump tweeted Tuesday, embracing a phrase popularized by President Richard Nixon decades ago, in claiming broad support for his actions. Trump also emphasized the political importance of the moment to his supporters on Twitter and declared that “My Admin has done more for the Black Community than any President since Abraham Lincoln.” The District of Columbia's federal status gives the president outsized authority to act, allowing him to direct the deployment of the National Guard. He authorized Attorney General William Barr to oversee a surge in the deployment of federal law enforcement officers, including the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sought to distance themselves from Monday night’s events after former military officials criticized their appearance with the president. Senior defense officials told reporters the two were not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible: “I just wish he opened it once in a while.” And D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said of the routing of the protesters, “At no time do we think it was appropriate that people who had not violated the curfew or anything else received that treatment."" Democrats weren't the only ones saying Trump had gone too far. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property, and no right to throw rocks at police,” said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.” It was Barr who gave the order Monday afternoon for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump's walk to the church and ahead of Washington's 7 p.m. curfew. Officials said the decision to clear the park was made earlier in the day in response to violence the night before. Trump also ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a “show of force,” according to two Defense Department officials. They said the U.S. military and National Guard were operating under the mission name “Operation Themis.” In Greek mythology, Themis is a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. Execution of the order to clear the park created striking split-screen images as officers deployed pepper spray, flash bangs and mounted units to break up the peaceful protest even as Trump was in the Rose Garden saying he supported the rights of peaceful protesters. Chemical remnants still hung in the air as he walked to the church. Trump reacted to the clearing of the protesters with enthusiasm, pumping his fist at officers in the park. He'd been furious about weekend images juxtaposing the fires in the area with the darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. Trump was also angry about the news coverage revealing that he had been rushed to the White House bunker during weekend protests, believing the park fires in what amounts to his extended front yard made him appear weak. But some White House and Justice Department officials privately acknowledged that Monday's events didn't serve the administration well. Trump on Tuesday appeared to be backing off his threat to deploy federal troops to quell unrest under the 1807 Insurrection Act. White House officials said Monday night's events indicated that the resources already available to local governments should be able to restore order. Instead, Trump turned his Twitter fire on New York officials, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a frequent political sparring partner. “New York was lost to the looters, thugs, Radical Left, and all others forms of Lowlife & Scum,"" Trump tweeted. ""The Governor refuses to accept my offer of a dominating National Guard. NYC was ripped to pieces.” The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, the White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was that if they don’t use all the tools in their arsenal they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response to any request for federal dollars to help with cleanup and recovery down. Trump, meanwhile, toured a Catholic shrine on Tuesday in his second straight religious-themed appearance after he declared himself to be the “president of law and order."" Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory called it “reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree.” On Tuesday's drive to the shrine, Trump’s motorcade sped past National Guard members deployed around the World War II Memorial. Some onlookers along the route booed, held “black lives matter” signs or made obscene gestures as the convoy rolled past. Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed Floyd’s neck with his knee as the man pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Violent demonstrations have raged in scores of American cities, marking a level of unrest unseen for decades. ___ Lemire reported from New York.",0.0

(WRIC) — Demonstrators are marching through Richmond for the fourth consecutive day to protest the death of George Floyd. Floyd died a week ago today after an encounter with four Minneapolis police officers who were responding to a call that he had allegedly used counterfeit money to purchase cigarettes from a local store. Video taken from the scene showed the officers pin Floyd, who was handcuffed, to the ground for several minutes. All of the officers involved were fired and the officer seen on video kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he complained that he couldn’t breathe, Derek Chauvin, was eventually charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. In order to reassure residents of their commitment “to maintain the trust of the public,” the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police and some local police chiefs issued statements on May 29 after charges against Chauvin were announced. Since then, protests in Richmond and across Virginia have taken place over the last three days. In response to violent protests, including the destruction of businesses, patrol vehicles and a GRTC bus, a state of emergency was declared by Gov. Ralph Northam and an 8 p.m. curfew was put in place in Richmond.

(WFXR) — The owner of Fifth and Federal Station apologized for a tweet Monday morning following a protest that caused a lot of damage to his building Sunday night. On Monday, June 1, people spent most of the day picking up the pieces of the restaurant. The windows were boarded up after being shattered by rocks and bricks when a peaceful protest escalated near the location on Sunday, May 31. Both the protest and the apology come after a Twitter post from Fifth and Federal got a lot of attention. The restaurant replied to a tweet from Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr. on Wednesday, May 27 in support of his call for face masks with an image from Gov. Ralph Northam’s old yearbook, showing a man in blackface standing next to a person dressed as a member of the KKK. If you get extra made let us know!

It was a foolish mistake to have ever posted it,” said Josh Read, the owner of Fifth and Federal. Read says he is sorry for the tweet and feels regret for it. “It’s just foolish for us to be blinded by the pandemic and not see how badly it hurt people.” Read says the tweet was meant to voice his frustration with the governor. “We were looking at it as what it was as a action towards Northam that we were blinded by what the actual racial portion of it,” said Read. Therefore, what started as a peaceful protest was held near his business Sunday night. Police say officers were trying to get people out of the street and make sure nobody was blocking traffic, but then things escalated. “Several of the protesters started committing criminal acts, to include vandalism of at least two different properties in that area,” said Lynchburg Police Chief Ryan Zuidema. Eventually things died down, but two officers were still injured and two people were arrested Sunday night. “Although we did have two injuries they were, in the broad scheme of things, relatively minor. And based on what took place last night, with gunshots being fired into our officer’s vehicles I’m just so grateful our officers went home safely,” said Chief Zuidema. In response to Sunday night’s violence, Lynchburg city leaders issued a local state of emergency and put a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. to start Tuesday, June 2. “My first and foremost role as police chief here is to ensure the safety and well-being of our community,” said Chief Zuidema. “We felt in the based on the actions of last night that was in our best interest.” The Lynchburg City Council voted to make the curfew mandatory. However, since it was originally announced as a voluntary curfew Monday afternoon, police were asked to be lenient with it Monday night and really start enforcing it Tuesday night. As it stands now, the ordinance allowing authorities to enact the curfew will last until further notice.

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to 'dominate the streets,' Trump said the U.S. military would step in to 'quickly solve the problem for them.' 'We have the greatest country in the world,' the president declared. 'We're going to keep it safe.' A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers "" all white "" to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president 'used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" 'It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. 'Shameful.' Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they 'look like fools' for not deploying even more National Guard troops. 'Most of you are weak,' he said. He added: 'You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the 'rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.' Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges 'when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.' In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. 'Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

President Donald Trump had announced he would soon be addressing the nation from the White House Rose Garden, as a 7 p.m. curfew in the city loomed and a mass of law enforcement, including U.S. Secret Service agents, Park Police and National Guardsmen, stood sentry, many dressed in riot gear. Moments before 6:30 p.m., just when Trump said he would begin his address, the officers suddenly marched forward, directly confronting the protesters as many held up their hands, saying, 'Don't shoot."" Soon, law enforcement officers were aggressively forcing the protesters back, firing tear gas and deploying flash bangs into the crowd to disperse them from the park for seemingly no reason. It was a jarring scene as police in the nation's capital forcefully cleared young men and women gathered legally in a public park on a sunny evening, all of it on live television. With smoke still wafting and isolated tussles continuing in the crowd, Trump emerged in the Rose Garden for a dramatic split-screen of his own creation. 'I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,"" he declared, before demanding that governors across the nation deploy the National Guard ""in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets."" And he warned that, if they refused, he would deploy the United States military 'and quickly solve the problem for them.' As an additional show of force, Trump announced he was deploying even more of the military to Washington, D.C., giving it the feel of an armed, locked-down city after days of violent clashes, arson and looting. 'As we speak I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers,"" he said, as explosions rang out in the background. 'We are putting everybody on warning.' Then, before departing, Trump announced he wasn't done for the evening, and would be ""going to pay my respects to a very very special place.' Moments later, the White House press pool was quickly summoned for a surprise movement. And soon after, Trump strolled out of the White House gates "" something he had never done before "" and walked across the park that had just been cleared to accommodate his movements. Trump walked slowly, followed by an entourage of his most senior aides, security and reporters. The faint residue of pepper spray hung in the air, stinging eyes and prompting coughing. Sections of the park and surrounding sidewalks were strewn with garbage, including plastic water bottles and other debris. Some sections had been scrawled with graffiti. Trump crossed H Street and walked toward St. John's Church, the landmark pale yellow building where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, then raised a black-covered Bible for reporters to see. 'We have a great country,' Trump said. 'Greatest country in the world.' He didn't talk about Floyd, the church or the damage it had suffered, or the peaceful protesters police had cleared. He said nothing about the coronavirus pandemic, the parallel crisis that has continued to ravage the nation as Trump campaigns for a second presidential term. And then he invited his attorney general, national security adviser, chief of staff, press secretary and defense secretary "" all white "" to join him for another round of photos before he walked back across the park to the White House. At one point, he stopped and pumped his fist in the air at National Guard members in the distance. 'We're going to keep it nice and safe,"" he said. Rabbi Jack Moline, the president of Interfaith Alliance, slammed the fact that peaceful protesters near the White House were gassed and shot with rubber bullets so Trump could hold his photo op. 'Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John's Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice "" right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area "" is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,"" Moline said in a statement. This only underscores the president's complete lack of compassion for Black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism.' And the Right Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, to which St. John's belongs, said she was 'outraged' by the moment and noted that Trump didn't pray during his visit. 'He took the symbols sacred to our tradition and stood in front of a house of prayer in full expectation that would be a celebratory moment,' Budde told The Associated Press. 'There was nothing I could do but speak out against that.'",0.0

(AP) "" Riot police firing tear gas scattered a protest crowd from a downtown Louisville square Monday night, hours after the firing of the city's police chief in the uproar over the early morning shooting death of a popular restaurant owner by security forces. David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue spot who was known for offering meals to police officers, died while police and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew early Monday amid waves of protests over a previous police shooting in Kentucky's largest city. Police said they were responding to gunfire from a crowd. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced the firing of Police Chief Steve Conrad at a news conference Monday. He said officers involved in the shooting failed to activate body cameras at the chaotic scene. Authorities had sought footage for their investigation, after Kentucky's governor demanded the release of police video. 'This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,' Fischer said. 'Accordingly, I have relieved Steve Conrad of his duties as chief of Louisville Metro Police Department.' Gov. Andy Beshear later called the lack of body camera footage unacceptable. 'This is the entire reason that we have those cameras,' the Democratic governor said at the state Capitol in Frankfort. Beshear authorized state police to independently investigate, promising the probe will be conducted in an 'honest and transparent way that will not take months.' U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman announced that federal authorities will be part of the investigation. The governor said he had counted on body camera footage to help determine 'the truth in a way that spoke for itself, at a time when trust is difficult and people deserve to be able to see and evaluate.' Late Monday afternoon, a huge group stretching several city blocks marched peacefully from downtown Louisville to the spot where McAtee was shot. Some motorists honked horns and raised fists in solidarity. Hundreds of protesters regrouped later Monday night at downtown Jefferson Square and riot police standing shoulder to shoulder advanced amid burts of fired tear gas, dispersing the crowd. Military-style vehicles could later be seen occupying the emptied-out square. The shakeup at the top of the city's police department came a month earlier than expected. Conrad had previously announced his resignation, which was to take effect at the end of June. Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder will step in immediately as chief, Fischer said. The mayor also said the city's curfew was being extended until June 8. Police did retrieve video from crime center cameras that showed how the shooting unfolded, Schroeder said. Two Louisville officers and two Guard soldiers returned fire, he said. The two officers violated policy by not wearing or activating body cameras, Schroeder said, adding they have been placed on administrative leave. McAtee, whose YaYa's BBQ Shack is near where the shooting occurred, was mourned by hundreds. Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist and executive director of the group Game Changers, said McAtee was well-liked. 'I've never known him to be aggressive in any kind of way,' he said. Schroeder agreed that McAtee was friendly to police officers. 'Over the years he's been a good friend to the police officers ... frequently making sure our officers had a good meal on their shifts,"" he said. Before his dismissal, Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. Monday outside a food market on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a group of curfew violators. Someone fired a shot at law enforcement officials, and both soldiers and officers returned fire, he said. Several 'persons of interest' were being interviewed, he said. News outlets showed video taken by someone in a car parked at a gas station. It recorded the sound of bullets being fired as groups of police and Guard soldiers crouched behind cars. Kris Smith said he was at a restaurant "" 'just outside having a good time, having drinks, eating barbecue' "" when the soldiers arrived. 'As soon as I walk to my car they jump out with the sticks, the police jump out with their sticks and their shields and stuff on,"" Smith said. 'It looked like something out of a movie. It looked like a freaking war zone.' He said he heard a loud noise, then gunfire minutes later. Smith, who is black, said the group had nothing to do with the protests. Protesters have been demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home. After Taylor's death, the mayor said Louisville police would be required to wear body cameras. ___ Associated Press contributors include Claire Galofaro and Rebecca Reynolds Yonker in Louisville.

Rouse said he walked with people in the Black Lives Matter 757 march, but he said he left while the protest was still peaceful.

'I am a mother to four black children in America, one of whom is 18 years old,' Bottoms said Friday in a rousing speech. 'When I saw the murder of George Floyd, I hurt like a mother.' Bottoms and other black female mayors, including Lori Lightfoot of Chicago, are leading some of the nation's largest cities during an unprecedented moment of challenge as protests against police brutality overlap with the coronavirus pandemic and an economic collapse. They're being praised as thoughtful leaders at a time of political tumult and high-profile examples of black women seeking and winning political office across the country. Higher Heights for America PAC, a political action committee dedicated to electing more progressive black women, said there are seven black women serving as mayors in the nation's 100 most populous U.S. cities, compared to just one in 2014. 'Black women have always been leading and we have been the defenders of our homes, our communities and our nation,' said Glynda Carr, the president and CEO of Higher Heights. 'Our leadership was built for this moment and their unique experiences as black women, not only as Americans, has provided the type of trusted leadership that can help move this country forward."" The mayors have demonstrated leadership with personal connections. Lightfoot, Chicago's first black female mayor and first openly gay leader, frankly acknowledged America's dark history of racism and blasted President Donald Trump's divisive tweets in which he called protesters 'thugs' and said 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts.' 'It's impossible for me as a black woman who has been the target of blatant racism over the course of my life not to take the killing of George Floyd personally,' Lightfoot said. 'Being black in America should not be a death sentence.' The question is whether this moment will translate into a long-lasting higher profile for the mayors. Bottoms, for example, was already believed to be under consideration as Joe Biden's running mate before the protests. Her stature has only risen amid the unrest. Beyond her well-received remarks Friday, she acted swiftly two days later, firing two police officers and placing three others on desk duty over excessive use of force during a protest arrest involving two college students. 'Use of excessive force is never acceptable,' Bottoms told reporters. Nadia Brown, a political science professor at Purdue University, said her research has found that many black female leaders, especially within their own communities, are seen as relatable figures "" something that has worked in their favor at this time. During the pandemic, residents made viral memes of Lightfoot enforcing her stay-at-home orders. Instead of chiding them, Lightfoot embraced the moment and used it to connect with residents, Brown said. 'I think that we're seeing some of this play out in real time,' Brown said. 'She was speaking in that role of telling residents what to do from an authority figure that seemed very familiar. And I think that's kind of a mode in which we're seeing some other black women elected officials deal with unrest in that they're speaking to constituents not just as an authority figure but one that is familiar."" Rochester, New York, Mayor Lovely Warren, who is in her second term as the first black female mayor of the state's third-largest city, said that while black women have made strides in gaining prominence, they still face unique challenges of racism and stereotypes. 'We're trying to fight a system that was institutionally built to create the disparities that it has created over generations and so we're trying to undo the damage that has been done to prepare our children for the future,"" Warren said. 'A lot of times we get branded with the 'angry black woman syndrome' when we're speaking up to a number of different issues that impact our community, but we have been built to take on the responsibility and we take it in stride."" 'No matter which mayor I look at across this country right now, they have done an extraordinary job trying to balance all that's coming toward them,' Warren added. Other black mayors including San Francisco's London Breed and Muriel Bowser of Washington have also been recognized for their measured responses and handling of their communities. A'shanti Gholar, president of Emerge America, an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office, said many of the black women in office today were entrenched in grassroots political work for decades, paving the way for those to come behind them. 'This is about a movement, a movement of women extending and taking their leadership all over across the country,' Gholar said. 'Black women running for office and winning, it isn't an anomaly. They're also building up the next generation of black women elected officials and black women mayors who they're inspiring to run."" Although gains have been made, Carr said there's still much more work to be done. Biden has pledged to pick a woman as a running mate and is considering several women of color. No black woman has ever served as governor in the country. Carr noted that black women make up 7.6% of the country's population yet account for just 4.3% of all members of the House and 1% of the Senate. 'All that we celebrate about the gains we made 51 years after Shirley Chisholm became the first black woman to serve in Congress, we also recognize that the 23 million black women in this country are so underrepresented and underserved,' Carr said. 'So, we need to continue to invest in recruiting, training and supporting black woman.' ___ Kat Stafford is a member of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a white police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft) CANBERRA – Tear gas choked Paris streets as riot police faced off with protesters setting fires Tuesday amid growing global outrage over George Floyd's death in the United States, racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics around the world. French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Police said at least 20,000 people joined the demonstration, defying a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Electric scooters and construction barriers went up in flames, and smoke stained a sign reading “Restaurant Open” — on the first day French cafes were allowed to open after nearly three months of virus lockdown. Chanting “I can’t breathe,” thousands marched peacefully through Australia’s largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was “shocked and appalled” by Floyd's death. Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America — and now, beyond. As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries. “This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,” Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, “all blacks live this to a degree.” Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden. But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice. As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city's frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille. The demonstrations were held in honor of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd’s death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases “have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition. Traore’s family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics — and that his last words were “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe” were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia’s treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. “I’m here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,” said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. “What’s happening in America shines a light on the situation here."" Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere. “We all watch in horror and consternation what’s going on in the United States,” he said after pausing 21 seconds before answering. “But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada.” More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell’s remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd’s death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that “like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.” He underlined that Europeans “support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions.” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd’s death are “understandable and more than legitimate.” “I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,” Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. “It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,” Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., “that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country.” Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color “is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.” ___ Associated Press writers Rick Rycroft in Sydney, Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, Lori Hinnant in Paris, Aritz Parra in Madrid, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Lorne Cook in Brussels, Peter Dejong in The Hague contributed. ___ Follow AP’s latest news about the protests at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

At that time, Prince William Police declared it an unlawful assembly and they were joined by State Police to disperse the protesters. Monday, June 1, Gainesville Supervisor Candland (R) addressed the incident in his email newsletter. Candland’s Letter: Dear Friends, The civil unrest resulting from the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis has justifiably sparked the frustrations of many in our community because of the senseless use of excessive force by law enforcement personnel against a man of color. I personally feel deep resentment that any person apprehended in the course of an investigation would be treated in such a horrific and inhumane manner. No justification exists for the prosecution of any personal racial bias by a law enforcement official against a person of color. NONE! Those responsible should be prosecuted. I think every decent person supports the non-violent protests that are placing a needed focus on the racism and bias that apparently resides in some sectors of the law enforcement community against minorities. We are a nation of laws, and we respect the rights bestowed by the US Constitution to peaceably express our views on any subject, including the shocking conduct by a law enforcement officer in the death of George Floyd. While the ability to protest is critical in our democracy, there is no room for protests that turn to violent, assaulting law enforcement officials, rioting, looting, destruction of public property, destruction of local businesses in the community, including minority-owned businesses. These protests should be rejected, and those responsible should be prosecuted. No community is immune to people who use these peaceful protests to project harm. Sadly, we saw the effects of that nefarious activity right here in Prince William County where last night a peaceful act of civil disobedience in the Gainesville District turned into a violent confrontation resulting in substantial property damage, injured police officers, and putting innocent citizens at risk who unfortunately were in the area. The Police ended up deploying chemical agents and rubber bullets to disperse several violent participants. Police reported that businesses were vandalized and individuals who were innocently in the area were put in danger. Four officers of the Virginia State Police were injured during this mayhem and several police vehicles were damaged from projectiles thrown at them. I spent most of the morning and afternoon visiting the site of the protest and talking with business owners and people who live in that area of the Gainesville District. They are worried that more riots will come and the violence might impact them further. Many of our small businesses are already on the ropes due to the COVID-19 crisis. Our community now faces the likely prospect of additional damage, employees being afraid of coming into work, and — based on what I have personally seen in the media — could destroy these businesses for good. The Police have also confirmed that demonstrations are planned in Gainesville and other areas in the upcoming days. You have my commitment that I will do whatever I can to allow people to safely demonstrate, while protecting our citizens, public safety personnel and businesses.

The original organizers of the protest remained peaceful throughout the evening. Protestors unaffiliated with the original organizers began arriving and the crowd grew into the later hours of the evening. Protestors began demonstrating in the roadway and were allowed to do so while they remained peaceful. Officers in the area then reported objects being thrown at them and also observed property damage. At approximately 11:31 p.m., the Manassas City Police Department declared an unlawful assembly. Officers announced the declaration to the protestors and the crowd was dispersed. There were no reports of officers being injured during the protest. No tear gas or less lethal weapons were deployed and no arrests were made in connection with the unlawful assembly. Windows to Glory Days Grill (9516 Signal Hill Road) were broken and two Manassas City Police cruisers were vandalized. The following law enforcement agencies assisted: Prince William County Police Department, Virginia State Police, Prince William County Sheriff’s Office, and the George Mason University Police Department.

(WAVY) — Virginia Natural Gas filed a rate request today with the Virginia State Corporation Commission (VSCC) seeking to eliminate bill-payment transaction fees and improve customer service. Customer service improvements include a proposal to improve customer call-waiting times and interactive assistance by establishing a virtual call center, creating employment opportunities for individuals who may prefer to work from home, including disabled veterans and military spouses, who are among the region’s most underemployed residents.  “Filing a rate request during the coronavirus health crisis is not something we take lightly,” said Jim Kibler, president of Virginia Natural Gas. “We understand the impacts COVID-19 has had on our community and are doing all we can to alleviate the burden.  At the same time, as part of our commitment to the communities we serve, we continue to make investments in order to provide safe and reliable natural gas service in times of uncertainty.”  The company’s last rate request was made three years ago in 2017. Since that time, the company has implemented the Southside Connector (SSC), modernized pipelines and services and removed low-pressure pipeline from its system.  The current request also includes additions to the company’s tariff to allow Renewable Natural Gas into the VNG pipeline system and offers a framework for a fixed bill option to help customers manage monthly bills.  In sum, the filing seeks approximately $49.6 million to properly finance ongoing operations based on these key investments.  Beginning Nov. 1, 2020, an average residential customer can expect an increase in their monthly bill of approximately $11, subject to the final approval of the VSCC in December. Latest Posts",0.0

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) TOKYO – Asian shares rose Wednesday after Wall Street extended its gains for the third straight day, driven by optimism over economies reopening from shutdowns to stem the coronavirus pandemic. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 1.1% to 22,581.19 in morning trading. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.8% to 5,882.60. South Korea's Kospi surged 2.6% to 2,141.28. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 1% to 5,894.00. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 1.1% at 24,258.49, while the Shanghai Composite added 0.4% to 2,931.90. “The theme of reopening optimism has its stronghold on markets going into the midweek, one to likewise inspire Asia markets gains despite the series of ongoing concerns,” said Jingyi Pan, market strategist for IG in Singapore. Among such concerns are the future of the two major economies of the world, China and the U.S and whether widespread protests in the U.S. will set off another rise in COVID-19 cases. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 closed 0.8% higher, at 3,080.82, after wavering throughout the morning. Technology, industrial and health care sector stocks accounted for a big slice of the gains. Energy stocks far outpaced the rest of the market as the price of crude rose ahead of a meeting of major oil producers. Bond yields climbed, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. So far, Wall Street’s momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, drawing threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. “The market action seems to have a lot more to do with people’s confidence about the economic reopening,” said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “It’s happening irrespective to what we’re seeing socially across the country right now.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1% to 25,742.65. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology companies, added 0.6%, to 9,608.37 after dipping as much as 0.8%. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains. The Russell 2000 index picked up 0.9%, to 1,418.21. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early Tuesday to kick off trading on the Nasdaq. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a staggering 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down 9% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift the restrictions that left broad swaths of the U.S. economy at a standstill beginning in March. While more countries and sectors are reopening, economic activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. Meanwhile, investors continue to keep an eye out for any signs that the reopening of the economy is leading to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. In Japan, Tokyo reported 34 newly confirmed cases on Tuesday, leading city officials to declare a largely symbolic “alert” for more social distancing. The Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo was lit red to remind residents. Before Tuesday, daily new infections had dropped below 20 recently. Bond yields were mostly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.71% from 0.68% late Tuesday. Benchmark U.S. crude added 76 cents to $37.57 a barrel. It rose $1.37 to $36.81 a barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude oil for August delivery gained 54 cents to $40.11 a barrel. The balance of this week will provide new data on the labor market, which has racked up huge increases in Americans who’ve lost their job as the coronavirus shutdowns left millions out of work. Payroll processor ADP issues its May survey of hiring by private U.S. companies on Wednesday. The weekly tally of applications for unemployment aid comes on Thursday. And on Friday, the government reports its May labor market data. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect the report will show the economy lost 9 million jobs last month and that the national unemployment rate jumped to nearly 20%. Investors will also have their eye on a couple of companies set to go public this week. Music company Warner Music Group is set to hold its IPO on Wednesday, while business information services company ZoomInfo Technologies is scheduled to go public on Thursday.

""I wanted my daughter to see the protests, it's really important. I've gotten a million questions from her because of it,"" says Ward-Audena, ""I think the most egregious statement was 'when they start looting, we start shooting.' That crossed a line for me."" Protests continue over the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) WASHINGTON – Undeterred by curfews, protesters streamed back into the nation's streets Tuesday, hours after President Donald Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by George Floyd's death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” But most protests passed peacefully, and while there were scattered reports of looting in New York City, the country appeared calmer by late Tuesday than it did a day earlier, when violence swept through multiple cities. The president, meanwhile, amplified his hard-line calls from Monday, when he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless."" The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in Los Angeles, Miami, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Houston, where the police chief talked to peaceful demonstrators, vowing reforms. “God as my witness, change is coming,” Art Acevedo said. “And we’re going to do it the right way.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday's protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,"" he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,"" she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump's threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower's use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that tested the nation’s ability to run elections while balancing a pandemic and sweeping social unrest. Joe Biden won hundreds more delegates and was on the cusp of formally securing the Democratic presidential nomination. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. ___ Sullivan reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

(AP) "" Several Democratic governors on Monday pushed back against President Donald Trump's threat to deploy the U.S. military unless they dispatch National Guard units to 'dominate the streets' in reaction to the violence that has erupted across the country. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he doesn't believe the federal government can send military troops into his state. He accused the president of creating an 'incendiary moment' by threatening to do just that to quell violence that has arisen as demonstrators have taken to the streets in reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 'I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois,"" Pritzker said on CNN after Trump urged governors to deploy the Guard. If they did not, he said he would send in 'thousands and thousands' of soldiers. Pritzker was among the first governors to react to Trump's comments, which came hours after the president called governors 'weak' and urged them to take a more aggressive response to weekend violence. It came as Americans gathered to protest police brutality against black Americans following the killing of Floyd, who was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with people breaking into and stealing from businesses, smashing car windows and setting fires. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not deployed the state's National Guard to New York City, although he said earlier Monday the state had 13,000 troops that 'we can use at any moment.' 'I say thank you but no thank you,"" Cuomo said on CNN about Trump's call to send military troops to the states. At least 23 states and the District of Columbia had already deployed guard troops as of Monday morning, according to a statement from the National Guard. It wasn't clear whether the action would be enough to satisfy the president. Trump took no questions from reporters and did not say how he would decide whether a state's response was sufficient. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has activated the state's guard, said in a statement he prays 'no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.' 'This president has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office,"" Inslee said in a statement. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat, said any suggestions the state's National Guard is ill equipped to handle the states needs is 'misinformed.' ""As the Commander In Chief of the Nevada National Guard I can state, categorically, that they have done their duty to protect all Nevadans, and will continue to do so.' In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of demonstrators. She refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler's request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation, but on Monday activated 50 unarmed guard members in support roles. 'You don't defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,' Brown, a Democrat, said earlier Monday in reaction to Trump's comments about governors being weak in their response. 'Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform.' She didn't immediately comment on Trump's remarks about deploying the U.S. military. Nor did California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has deployed thousands of guard troops to Los Angeles and other cities. He called Trump's morning comments 'noise' and avoided addressing them directly, although he said the nation is desperate for leadership. Guard members can assist law enforcement and perform duties such as traffic control, communications support and extinguishing fires. __ Associated Press writers Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington, and Michelle Price in Las Vegas contributed to this report.",0.0

As the the curfew time arrived, many were still in the streets and continued marching, with officers initially standing by and allowing them. But officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them. “Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change. ___ WASHINGTON — The protest in the nation’s capital on Tuesday night lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd outside Lafayette Park near the White House was peaceful, polite even, as they protested the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minnesota. Instead of the spray-painted tags, the protesters Tuesday favored colorful children’s street chalk, writing Black Lives Matter slogans on the asphalt in front of St. John’s Church. Protesters chanted and talked among themselves, most wearing masks, but not social distancing in the age of COVID-19. One protester, Mati Yiheyis, a 21-year-old college student at the University of Virginia, speculated that fears of coronavirus kept many older people away. When one protester climbed a lamp post and removed a street sign he was roundly booed by others. “It’s not what we’re about,” said protester George “T.J.” Pierce of Washington. The crowd started thinning out on its own after 8 p.m., an hour after a curfew went into place, although a core group of several hundred remained at the fence, chanting at the line of police and soldiers in riot gear on the other side. On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at St. John’s Church, known as the church of presidents. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. ___ LOS ANGELES -- Thousands have taken to the streets of Los Angeles in peaceful protests Tuesday, and smaller demonstrations dotted other California cities while authorities renewed overnight curfews in LA and other areas that have seen clashes with police and groups of thieves wreck hundreds of businesses. There were several sizable demonstrations in Los Angeles and Mayor Eric Garcetti took a knee at one while in a crowd outside police headquarters. However, later in the day, hundreds gathered outside the mayor’s house and protested. Elsewhere in the city, police cordons backed by National Guard troops kept a tight watch on marchers in Hollywood, where hundreds were arrested a day earlier, and at a crowd of thousands at City Hall. In San Francisco, a mass of people marched up the Great Highway along San Francisco’s Ocean Beach. At San Jose’s City Hall, several hundred people showed up for a demonstration and speeches organized by the local branch of the NAACP. San Francisco Police Chief William Scott asked supervisors Tuesday to keep an overnight curfew order for at least the “next few days” to get ahead of people bent on using peaceful protests to pilfer stores and commit violence. Mayor London Breed ordered the 8 p.m. curfew Sunday following a night of thefts downtown, including at a major shopping mall where several fires were set. ___ MELBOURNE, Australia — Police are urging thousands of demonstrators planning to attend a protest rally in Australia’s second-largest city over George Floyd’s death to reconsider due to social distancing rules. Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornelius on Wednesday described the rally planned for Saturday as the largest mass gathering in Melbourne since pandemic restrictions were introduced in March. Public gatherings are limited to 20 people in Victoria state, and people must keep 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart. Australia has recorded 7,221 coronavirus cases with 26 in hospitals on Wednesday. There have been 102 deaths. Cornelius did not say whether police plan to fine protesters, but told reporters that “police would prefer people obey the law.” Police have not enforced social distancing regulations when thousands gathered peacefully in Sydney and Perth in solidarity with U.S. demonstrators and to protest against the over-representation of indigenous Australians in prisons. Protesters attempted to get around social distancing rules by demonstrating over an unrelated issue in their cars in Melbourne in April. But police fined 26 of them 1,652 Australian dollars ($1,145) each and arrested their organizer for breaching a ban on non-essential travel. That ban has since been lifted. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The Minneapolis school board has voted to end its contract with the Minneapolis Police Department following the death last week of George Floyd. The Star Tribune reports the vote was unanimous Tuesday. Minneapolis Public Schools will stop further negotiations with the Police Department. Schools Superintendent Ed Graff must come up with a new plan for school safety by the board’s Aug. 18 meeting. School board chairwoman Kim Ellison said in an interview that she values “people and education and life.” Ellison said she’s now convinced, “based on the actions of the Minneapolis Police Department, that we don’t have the same values.” The Minneapolis and St. Paul school districts have faced criticism over the use of school resource officers. Both districts have sought to transform the role to be more of a mentor than an enforcer. ___ BEIJING -- An official Chinese Communist Party newspaper is hammering President Donald Trump’s call to send in troops to put down protests and rioting with an editorial published Wednesday entitled “Quelling Protests With Troops Self-Contradictory For US.” The paper, known as strongly nationalist and for its anti-American views, wrote: “This could be argued as the most extreme response to disorder among governments across the world.” “Then why did Washington arrogantly and unreasonably accuse other countries of quelling riots? Why did politicians in Washington overbearingly portray the U.S. as the beacon of democracy and human rights? Have they really not anticipated that the U.S. could one day confront the situation as it does today and that their previous big talk could become a slap on their face?” The editorial attacked the U.S. for continuing to criticize Hong Kong’s heavy-handed approach to sometimes violent anti-government protests, and for Beijing’s move to enact national security legislation for the territory, while the U.S. failed to respond earlier to the coronavirus pandemic and police now battle protesters on American city streets. “The hooligan nature of Washington makes it a complete nuisance,” the paper said. ___ WASHINGTON — The U.S. Park Police denied using tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters outside the White House on Monday night, saying officers instead used smoke canisters and pepper balls to aggressively push back the demonstrators. Protesters scrambled as smoke filled the streets and AP journalists witnessed people reacting to their eyes and throats becoming irritated. Journalists covering the protest reported the crowd was largely peaceful at the time; the Park Police said they were responding to protesters throwing items, including bricks and frozen water bottles at law enforcement. Justice Department officials offered a different explanation, saying officers were carrying out Attorney General William Barr’s order to expand the security perimeter outside the White House. Officers repelled the crowd nearly 30 minutes ahead of a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington. Shortly after the crowd was pushed back, President Donald Trump walked through the park where they had gathered for a photo opportunity at a nearby church. ___ DALLAS — Former President George W. Bush criticized any effort to squelch protests of George Floyd’s death while in Minneapolis police custody. In a statement issued Tuesday by his office in Dallas, the former Republican president said he and wife Laura Bush “are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country.” Bush did not refer specifically toward President Donald Trump, but he called the harassment and threats toward African American protesters “a shocking failure.” “It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. ... Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place,” he said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said Tuesday that she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father who would never get to see his daughter grow up. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took. At the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I’m here for my baby and I’m here for George because I want justice for him. I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” Floyd died on Memorial Day after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into the black man’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. ___ LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson declared a state of emergency Tuesday in response to continued demonstrations to protest the death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police. A statement from the governor's spokeswoman said the action will unify command of local and state police, the Arkansas National Guard and the state Department of Emergency Management. The spokeswoman minimized the significance of the move, however. “This is a normal executive order issued when the National Guard is activated under state control in regard to civil disturbance. Under this executive order, sheriff offices and police departments maintain command and operational control of their respective jurisdictions,” Katie Beck said in her statement. Also Tuesday, Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott expanded the city’s curfew a day after Arkansas authorities again used tear gas to break up protests outside the state Capitol. Scott said the city’s nighttime curfew will begin 8 p.m. ___ ATLANTA — Hundreds of protesters lingered on the streets of downtown Atlanta on Tuesday night ahead of another 9 p.m. curfew imposed by Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Authorities used armored vehicles to form a cordon at the state Capitol nearby. Bottoms has implemented the curfew every night, starting Saturday. As the curfew took effect, police and National Guard troops moved in, firing tear gas. The crowd quickly dispersed, and television footage showed police leading some people away in zip ties. ___ SEATTLE — Mayor Jenny Durkan addressed a large crowd protesting George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, telling them their “voices holding me accountable are important.” Tuesday was the fifth day of protests in the Northwest’s largest city over the death of Floyd in police custody. Monday’s protests were largely peaceful but turned chaotic as officers dispersed the crowd at night using tear gas and flash-bang devices. Authorities said demonstrators threw fireworks and tried to storm a barricade, but citizen video showed the chaos began when an officer grabbed a pink umbrella that a demonstrator was holding just across a barricade. Standing next to the city’s police chief at the downtown Emergency Operations Center, Durkan said she supported the crowd’s right to rally against injustice. “We want you to march, we want you to raise your voices, we want you to continue on your path of justice,” Durkan said over a microphone as the crowd listened, mostly in silence. “But we need you, please, to do it peacefully.” The mayor, a former U.S. attorney, then took questions from some in the crowd. ___ ST. PAUL, MINN. — Thousands of protesters gathered on the front lawn of the Minnesota Capitol as part of a youth protest for George Floyd on Tuesday afternoon. The crowd listened to speakers and periodically chanted slogans like, “Say his name: George Floyd.” William Ray, 22, said his protest was about more than just George Floyd’s death last week. His grandparents were civil rights activists in the 60s and also members of the Black Panther Party. “I grew up with an understanding of what needs to be done, growing up with them and seeing the change that they brought to the community. ... America was built off of slaves -- my ancestors. A lot of the systems that were in place then are still here,” he said. Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, of Blaine, Minnesota, said she’s felt disheartened by the “endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying.” Of the unrest that has gripped cities across the nation, she said, “there’s always going to be a breaking point.” “It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. ___ WASHINGTON — A former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says he was “sickened” to see National Guard troops and other security personnel forcibly clear protesters from a square near the White House to facilitate President Donald Trump’s walk to a nearby church to pose for photographers. Calling the visit Monday a “stunt,” Mike Mullen, a retired Navy admiral who headed the military from 2007 to 2011, wrote in The Atlantic on Tuesday it laid bare what he called Trump’s “disdain” for the rights of peaceful protesters. He said it also risked further politicizing the military. Mullen cautioned against an overly aggressive use of the military to restrain the sometimes-violent protests around the country. He said he has confidence in the professionalism of the troops but worries about the soundness of the orders they would be given by Trump. ___ MIAMI — A demonstration in Miami grew to about 400 people as protesters marched from a courthouse to a historically black neighborhood north of downtown. Demonstrators sat on one knee during several stops to listen to organizers shouting instructions that they were to remain peaceful and hydrated in the 80-degree weather. They shouted “No justice, no peace, no racist police” as more than 30 officers followed the group a few blocks behind wearing body armor. Twenty-two-year-old Trinity Auberry arrived at the demonstration with four other friends. It was the first time protesting for the young black model who said the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis is not isolated and cases of “police brutality” are also common in Florida. ___ CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The West Virginia National Guard is pursuing disciplinary action against a guardsman who posted on social media that he would shoot at people protesting the death of George Floyd, officials said Tuesday. The guardsman, Noah Garcelon, has already resigned his position as an officer with the Winfield Police Department after making the comments. In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would “start firing live rounds” at protesters and “see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.” Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state’s National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others “who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.” Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn’t a racist before resigning. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent. ___ COLUMBIA, S.C. — About 100 people gathered in front of the state capitol building in downtown Columbia, South Carolina, on Tuesday afternoon as medics passed out water bottles and snacks and volunteers passed out voter registration forms. Participants raised their fists in unison as passing commuters showed their solidarity with honks and waves. An outreach minister emphasized the need to sustain demonstrations past the initial events over the weekend and also urged a peaceful nature in the afternoon’s demonstrations. Minister Danielle Ford told the crowd, “they’re waiting on us to give up, they’re waiting on us to get tired, they’re waiting on us to give in. We need you out here.” A 21-year-old college student said she was protesting for justice for George Floyd as well as Joshua Ruffin, a 17-year-old shot to death by a Columbia police officer after a foot chase in April. ___ HOUSTON -- Houston rappers Bun B and Trae Tha Truth organized a march on Tuesday and told the crowd it would be peaceful. After asking the crowd of several thousand to look for anybody who could cause trouble, Bun B then led them on a chant. He said “What’s his name?” and the crowd replied, “George Floyd.” The crowd later got down on one knee and was silent for 30 seconds. Among those participating was a group of about 60 people on horseback from a riding club in Houston. ___ LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday more than 2,700 people have been arrested since protests and violence began in the nation’s second-largest city. The chief told the city Police Commission that about 2,500 of those arrests were for failure to disperse or curfew violations. The remainder were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence. The chief gave the figures during a report to the Police Department’s civilian oversight board. Several new demonstrations in Los Angeles on Tuesday over the death of George Floyd have remained peaceful. ___ PARIS — Riot officers have fired tear gas as scattered protesters threw projectiles and set fires during an unauthorized demonstration against police violence and racial injustice. Several thousand people had previously rallied peacefully for two hours Tuesday around the main Paris courthouse in homage to George Floyd and to Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Police had banned the protest because of coronavirus restrictions that forbid any gathering of more than 10 people. As the demonstration wound down, police fired tear gas and protesters could be seen throwing projectiles. Two small fires broke out. Tensions also erupted at a related protest Tuesday in the southern city of Marseille. ___ CHICAGO -- Authorities in a Chicago suburb where two people were fatally shot in unrest following George Floyd’s death are issuing fresh safety precautions Tuesday. Cicero officials cautioned residents to “stay home and stay off the streets” a day after violence and destruction erupted in the town of about 84,000 west of Chicago. Police say most of Monday’s chaos stemmed from residents trying to defend businesses. Roughly 60 people were arrested, mostly for burglary and weapons violations. Two men in their 20s were fatally shot around 6 p.m. in separate incidents related to the violent clashes. ___ TRENTON, N.J. — Citing George Floyd’s death, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Tuesday the state will update its guidelines governing the use of force by police for the first time in two decades and will move to require a statewide licensing program for all officers. At least 43 other states require some licensing requirement for officers, Grewal said, adding he wants to bring law enforcement in line with other professions that require licensing. The announcements also include a pilot program in a handful of cities across the state to conduct training programs aimed at promoting safe interactions between police and communities and the implementation of a statewide database to document when police use force, Grewal said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The state of Minnesota has filed a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department in the wake of George Floyd’s death. The state says it will investigate the department’s policies and practices over the last 10 years to determine whether it has engaged in “systemic” discrimination against people of color. The complaint comes from the state Department of Human Rights, which enforces the state’s human rights act. It targets a police department that has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African-Americans and other minorities including within the department itself. Critics say the department has a culture that resists change and the department has come under fresh criticism after Floyd died after a white officer knelt on his neck and ignored his cries of “I can’t breathe” until Floyd eventually stopped moving. ___ WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear Lafayette Park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, leading to police using tear gas to disperse protesters. A person familiar with the matter tells The Associated Press that Barr expected the perimeter to have been extended much earlier Monday. The person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. The person said officials had met that morning and decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block after multiple fires were set in the park the night before. They said that was expected to happen by Monday afternoon. The person said Barr was surprised it hadn’t been done when he arrived in the early evening and directed action to be taken. They said he assumed police would use “typical crowd control measures” against protesters who resisted commands to clear the area. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — Prosecutors are delaying the case against a man who drove his semitrailer into a crowd of protesters on a closed Minneapolis freeway. The 35-year-old man drove his tanker truck into the midst of thousands of people who had gathered on Interstate 35W near downtown Minneapolis on Sunday. Authorities said it appeared no one was hurt and the man was arrested. Gov. Tim Walz said the man became confused and somehow got on the freeway before traffic officials closed it. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced Tuesday that the case against the man has been deferred pending further investigation and he’ll be released from jail. Freeman said investigators are working to gather additional information to help in making a charging decision. ___ WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump ordered military aircraft to fly above the nation’s capital Monday night as a “show of force” against demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd, according to two Department of Defense officials. Show-of-force missions are designed to intimidate and, in combat zones, warn opposing forces of potential military action if provoked. The officials, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing operations publicly, did not say how many or what type of aircraft had been mobilized. Videos and photographs posted on social media showed helicopters flying low over buildings and hovering just above groups who were on the street despite a district-wide curfew. On Tuesday, roughly 700 members of the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division had arrived at two military bases near Washington. Another 1,400 soldiers are ready to be mobilized within an hour, the two Pentagon officials said. The soldiers are armed and have riot gear as well as bayonets. The officials said the mission has been named “Operation Themis.” In Greek mythology, Themis was a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. -- Reporting by James LaPorta",0.0

Breonna Taylor, a black woman, was fatally shot by police in her home in March. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings) One man was a retired St. Louis police captain checking on his friend's shop. Another was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who provided free meals to officers. Yet another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths, as well as widespread peaceful protests, have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of heavy-handed police tactics, vandalism and arson. Dozens have been injured in the chaos. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: ST. LOUIS A 77-year-old retired St. Louis police captain who served 38 years on the force was shot and killed by looters at a pawn shop early Tuesday, authorities said. David Dorn was found dead on the sidewalk in front of the ransacked store. Police have not released details about what led to the shooting, and no one has been arrested. The shooting apparently was streamed on Facebook Live but has been taken down. It came on a violent night in St. Louis, which saw four officers shot, businesses burned and ransacked, and people pelting officers with rocks hours following a peaceful protest. Dorn was a friend of the pawn shop’s owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, wife Ann Marie Dorn told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. David Dorn's personality was “bigger than life,” said former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch. “He was a fun guy, a happy guy."" Dorn retired in October 2007 and then became police chief of Moline Acres, a small town north of St. Louis. ___ LOUISVILLE Police and the National Guard troops trying to clear a crowd Monday heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. “We lost a wonderful citizen,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.” Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said Tuesday that video from security cameras at McAtee’s business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gun as officers approached. “This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,” Schroeder said. The protests also have centered on the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her Louisville home in March as narcotics detectives serving a search warrant knocked down her door. No drugs were found. ___ OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal officer was providing security at a U.S. courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It wasn't immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. No one has been arrested. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers employed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service. They were monitoring a nearby protest. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant congressional seat north of Los Angeles. ___ INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as “Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after graduation. He also was a prominent businessman, running multiple nightclubs. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together."" The circumstances of Beaty's shooting weren't immediately clear, but some media reports said it happened near his apartment. It came the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. ___ DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because a protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kansas. No arrests have been made. “She was always smiling, always laughing. That’s why it’s so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,” Hale said. “That is not Italia. She was the bright, bubbly big personality in the room.” Separately, authorities said an officer was “ambushed” with gunfire Sunday. Another officer shot back, and the suspects fled but were arrested. Near where the officer was wounded, police found a man shot to death and a handgun under his body. His identity wasn't released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other, police said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest. ___ OMAHA, NEBRASKA James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man, was killed Saturday after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two downtown bars. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including Scurlock, approach white bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people shove Gardner to the ground, and he fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen jumping on Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges in the death, calling the shooting self-defense. But Gardner could still face misdemeanor gun charges because his concealed carry permit for the gun had expired, the police chief said. ___ DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone opened fire and then ran away. ___ SUBURBAN CHICAGO Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the suburb of Cicero, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania did not provide details about those who were killed but said it happened during protests. ___ Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report.",0.0

""Particularly at Eastern Mennonite University, where we are a peace and justice faith based liberal arts college, this cuts us to the bone,"" EMU president Susan Schultz Huxman told WHSV on Monday. Schultz Huxman wrote a letter to the EMU community, quoting scripture and civil rights leaders, while also expressing sympathy for the George Floyd's death. Schultz Huxman says it's a tough time for the black community, that has already been disproportionately negatively affected by the coronavirus pandemic. ""All of these things have impacted communities of color even more deeply and so you have that as already a major crisis,"" Schultz Huxman said. ""You put on top of it some of the recent incidents in Minneapolis, in Kentucky, in Florida."" About one-third of EMU's students are people of color, the highest percentage of the four universities mentioned in this article. In the 1940s, EMU became the first school in Virginia to accept a black student. Now, Schultz Huxman said, it's time for EMU and others to learn and listen. ""This is an opportunity for us to listen and to collaborate,"" Schultz Huxman said. ""We do have not only plans in terms of on the enrollment front, but even our board of trustees, a real sense of commitment to diversity there as well."" Bridgewater College's announcement was a letter from president David Bushman. Bushman also addressed racism, citing the recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd. Bushman wrote that ""we face again the consequences of racism and our society’s collective failure to recognize the dignity of every person,"" and also wrote, ""while our attention may have been focused on the pandemic, the underlying realities of inequality have never gone away and have been manifested now in unspeakable ways."" Bushman recommended that students reach out to the Bridgewater College CARE team, that according to the college's website is ""a college-wide reporting system for the care and support of students,"" if they have any issues. JMU's letter was sent by president Jonathan Alger to all JMU students on Sunday, according to JMU's website. Alger also mentioned recent incidents, writing that they've ""resulted from our collective failure to live up to the promise of a democracy that is of, by, and for the people — all the people."" Alger wrote that JMU will be hosting virtual events to address recent events. Mary Baldwin also made a statement Monday, mourning the death of Floyd. In an e-mail to WHSV, a university representative said ""MBU's commitment to social justice and inclusivity is constant and ingrained in our curriculum, our policies, and our programming through such groups as the Spencer Center for Civic and Global and Engagement, the Office of Inclusive Excellence, the arts, and elsewhere across our campus.""",0.0

In recent years, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the face of the movement. In 2016, he began kneeling before games, during the playing of the national anthem, to protest police treatment of minorities and social inequality. Since last week's death of George Floyd, an African American man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck, there's been a surge of sports figures speaking out. Some have even joined demonstrations that have swept the nation. True to its status as the most politically progressive of this country's major sports, the NBA has had many players and officials lend their voices – from Commissioner Adam Silver to Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James to legendary Lakers center and longtime political activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who wrote about what he believes is the motivation behind the widespread protests. ""The black community is used to the institutional racism inherent in education, the justice system and jobs,"" Abdul-Jabbar said in a Los Angeles Times essay last weekend. ""And even though we do all the conventional things to raise public and political awareness ... the needle hardly budges."" He added, ""Yes, protests often are used as an excuse for some to take advantage, just as when fans celebrating a hometown sports team championship burn cars and destroy storefronts. I don't want to see stores looted or even buildings burn. But African Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you're choking on it — until you let the sun in."" Even Michael Jordan weighed in publicly, which to many was a surprise. The recent 10-part ESPN documentary, The Last Dance, lionized the legendary Chicago Bulls star, although it touched on a few perceived shortcomings, including what some see as Jordan's unwillingness to speak out on political issues. ""I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in,"" Jordan said in the documentary, adding, ""but I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player. ""I wasn't a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That's where my energy was."" But now Jordan is speaking out, an indication of how deeply Floyd's death has resonated. ""I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,"" Jordan said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough."" There have been other heartfelt, and perhaps surprising, shows of solidarity. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz also has been largely apolitical in his four years in the NFL. But last week, Wentz was one of the first prominent white athletes to speak out. ""Being from North Dakota, I've spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I'm never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through,"" Wentz said on Twitter. ""I'll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color. ... ""I don't understand the society we live in that doesn't value all human life. It's heartbreaking and disturbing. My prayers go out to every man, woman and child that has to endure the effects of the racism in our society."" Former and current African American teammates praised Wentz. ""You didn't have to say a thing but you did,"" former Eagles receiver Torrey Smith tweeted, adding, ""Love you bro."" Traditionally, Major League Baseball has, as a sport, avoided politics. Not now. A number of big leaguers have weighed in, including Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle. He's white, and he offered historical context in a tweet with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. ""Racism is America's Original Sin,"" Doolittle wrote. ""It was here before we even forged a nation, and has been passed down from generation to generation. And we still struggle to acknowledge that it even exists, much less atone for it. The generational trauma of racism and violence is killing black men and women before our eyes. ... ""We must not look away from the racism and violence. ... We must take action and call it out for what it is. We must recognize our shared humanity and atone for our Original Sin, or else we will continue to curse future generations with it. ""RIP George Floyd."" Still silence Even though the current environment seems to encourage sports figures to speak out, there's also notable silence coming from the sports world. So says LeVelle Moton. Moton is the men's basketball head coach at North Carolina Central University. He said white basketball and football coaches from the most prominent college conferences in the nation — the Power Five — are not speaking up. And he said he believes they should be. In fact, he said, they're obligated to do so. ""The reality is, a lot of these coaches have been able to create generational wealth,"" Moton told ESPN Radio. ""Their grandkids' kids are gonna be able to live a prosperous life because athletes who were the complexion of George Floyd were able to run a football, throw a football, shoot a basketball or whatever have you, so they have benefited greatly from athletes that look like George Floyd and many more. But whenever people the complexion of George Floyd are killed, assassinated, murdered in the street in broad daylight, they're silent."" Not all. Prominent white college basketball coaches have spoken out against Floyd's death, including the University of Kentucky's John Calipari, Roy Williams of the University of North Carolina and Michigan State University head coach Tom Izzo. Nick Saban is the most famous active head coach in Division 1 college football. He also released a statement about Floyd. ""We're at an important moment for our country,"" the University of Alabama coach said in a message that cited civil rights icons Rosa Parks and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., ""and now is the time for us to choose kindness, tolerance, understanding, empathy, and most importantly ... it's time to love each other. Every life is precious, and we must understand we have so many more things that unite us than divide us."" Still, the complexity of Kaepernick Sunday's Houston Chronicle sports section went beyond the myriad athlete and coach statements of grief and resolve. It took a strong stand with a full-page editorial statement. The page had a picture of Floyd at the top and a kneeling Kaepernick at the bottom. In between, a section read, ""Imagine, if we had embraced Colin Kaepernick's peaceful protest and paid attention to the issue he was trying to address."" It wasn't the only connector between Floyd and Kaepernick. A dramatic meme circulating since Floyd's death shows a picture of the Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, next to a picture of Kaepernick kneeling in protest. The visuals have stirred up the not-too-distant memory of Kaepernick's protest, which began in 2016, and was politicized from the beginning. And it's prompting harsh criticism of the NFL, even as the league joins the massive sports outpouring of grief and anger. Last weekend, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement offering condolences to Floyd's family as well as those of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, young African Americans also killed in recent high-profile cases. ""These tragedies inform the NFL's commitment and our ongoing efforts,"" Goodell said, adding, ""There remains an urgent need for action. We recognize the power of our platform in communities and as part of the fabric of American society. We embrace that responsibility and are committed to continuing the important work to address these systemic issues together with our players, clubs and partners."" Critics blasted Goodell for what they called hypocrisy. ""Colin Kaepernick asked the NFL to care about the lives of black people and they banned him from their platform,"" said Michael-Shawn Dugar, an NFL writer for The Athletic. Instead of prompting a discussion about police treatment of minorities and social inequality, Kaepernick's protests prompted a debate about patriotism and the flag, fueled by President Trump, who used an expletive to describe Kaepernick and other players who joined the pregame protests. Even though the NFL ultimately endorsed social justice initiatives, Kaepernick still is considered a pariah — no NFL owner has hired him. And with the league dealing with a significant lack of diversity in important head coaching and general manager positions, Goodell's critics said his reference to the league's ""commitment and our ongoing efforts"" is insincere. On their face, Goodell's words seemed in lockstep with much of the rest of the sports world as it grapples with and grieves over Floyd's death. But for many, the renewed attention on Kaepernick and his experience present just as powerful a message about the powerful NFL, where, in the volatile realm of race and justice, words appear louder than actions.

(Source: AP Photo/Noah Berger) But most protests passed peacefully, and while there were scattered reports of looting in New York City, the country appeared calmer by late Tuesday than it did a day earlier, when violence swept through multiple cities. The president, meanwhile, amplified his hard-line calls from Monday, when he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn't do it. ""NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,"" he tweeted. ""The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!"" One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. ""Last night pushed me way over the edge,"" said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. ""Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless."" The crowd remained in place after the city's 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights' demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: ""Peaceful protest!"" On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John's Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in Los Angeles, Miami, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Houston, where the police chief talked to peaceful demonstrators, vowing reforms. ""God as my witness, change is coming,"" Art Acevedo said. ""And we're going to do it the right way."" In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday's protests. Macy's flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. ""We're going to have a tough few days,"" he warned, but added: ""We're going to beat it back."" He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and ""create peace."" Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city ""a disgrace."" ""The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,"" Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation's largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. ""I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,"" Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. ""I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good."" On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. ""It feels like it's just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing's really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,"" said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. ""There's always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we're seeing the breaking point around the country."" ""I live in this state. It's really painful to see what's going on, but it's also really important to understand that it's connected to a system of racial violence,"" she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump's threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. ""Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,"" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower's use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that tested the nation's ability to run elections while balancing a pandemic and sweeping social unrest. Joe Biden won hundreds more delegates and was on the cusp of formally securing the Democratic presidential nomination. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. ___ Sullivan reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report. Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you; you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" ""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard."" ""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly."" Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal."" ""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way."" In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

But several states and the District of Columbia have primaries up and down the ballot: Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail by one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He went into the day 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to get. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote, with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary, with its 186 delegates). Rep. Steve King on the ropes. The controversial Iowa conservative faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who has painted King as ineffective in the House, given that he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. Former state Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face either state Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks or ex-Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling, who moved to Iowa in 2017. Miller-Meeks got the backing of Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, have backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces a challenge from the left. A veteran lawmaker from Maryland's 5th Congressional District and No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, Hoyer faces a progressive primary challenge from 29-year-old Mckayla Wilkes. Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment has remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He has outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET Loading... Spy games in New Mexico. The announced retirement of New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall set off a domino effect. Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Luján declared for Udall's Senate seat, leaving open his seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Enter: Valerie Plame, the ex-CIA agent. She has raised and spent more than any candidate in this race and gained national attention with her glossy campaign ad showing her racing backward in a Chevy Camaro on a dusty road. But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take on Torres Small this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It has been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase has outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... Senate matchups to be set in Iowa and Montana. Democrats are hoping to take back the Senate this fall. They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired Adm. Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach who has spent the second most — $1.4 million — on this primary. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... When Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock changed his mind and decided to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, it suddenly put this race on the map for Democrats in a big way. Three other Democrats are on the ballot Tuesday, but Bullock has been expected to win easily, raising more than 10 times what his next opponent has. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Indiana openings. The retirements of moderate Democrat Pete Visclosky in Indiana's 1st District and Republican Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in Congress, in the 5th District has opened up both of these ideologically divergent seats. More than half a dozen Democrats are competing in the 1st District, which is suburban and exurban Chicago, a place that went for Hillary Clinton with 54% of the vote in 2016. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET Loading... In the 5th District, a handful of Republicans have duked it out, including state Sen. Victoria Spartz, who raised and spent the most and got the backing of the Club for Growth, and Beth Henderson, a local businesswoman with the endorsement of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun. Democrats have rallied around one candidate, Christina Hale. This district has been in GOP hands for a long time, but it could be one to watch this fall.

Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful. But looting and vandalism in some areas along Van Nuys Boulevard prompted a response from officers, who fired bean bags. Authorities also responded to a fire at a strip mall, according to the Los Angeles Times. San Francisco Bay Area Some 15,000 people marched peacefully in downtown Oakland, according to a police spokesperson quoted in the East Bay Times. Most dispersed prior to the start of the city's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. More than 40 people were arrested for violating the curfew, according to the Oakland Police Department. The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said. Police said some protesters had vandalized a handful of vehicles, according to NPR member station KQED. More than a dozen San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions have imposed curfews in the wake of protests sparked by Floyd's death. Corrections: 6/02/20 A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that 15,000 people marched on Interstate 680 in Walnut Creek, Calif., and were dispersed by police. The correct figure is several hundred. The march by 15,000 people was peaceful and took place in Oakland, Calif.",0.0

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has blamed antifa activists for violence at protests over police killings of black people, but antifa isn’t an organization and targeting it isn’t so simple. A look at what antifa is and is not: WHAT IS ANTIFA? Short for “anti-fascists,” antifa is not a single organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. There is no hierarchical structure to antifa or universal set of tactics that makes its presence immediately recognizable, though members tend to espouse revolutionary and anti-authoritarian views, said Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University and author of “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.” “They do different things at different times in different ways, some of which there is evidence of them breaking the law. Other times there is not,” Bray said. Literature from the antifa movement encourages followers to pursue lawful protest activity as well as more confrontational acts, according to a 2018 Congressional Research Service report. The literature suggests that followers monitor the activities of white supremacist groups, publicize online the personal information of perceived enemies, develop self-defense training regimens and compel outside organizations to cancel any speakers or events with “a fascist bent,” the report said. People associated with antifa have been present for significant demonstrations and counter-demonstrations over the last three years, sometimes involving brawls and property damage. They mobilized against a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 and have clashed repeatedly with far-right groups in Portland, Oregon, including at a protest and counter-demonstration last summer that resulted in arrests and the seizure of shields, poles and other weapons. WHAT ROLE IS ANTIFA PLAYING IN THESE DEMONSTRATIONS? Trump and members of his administration have singled out antifa as being responsible for the violence at protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. In a pair of statements over the weekend, Attorney General William Barr described “antifa-like tactics” by out-of-state agitators and said antifa was instigating violence and engaging in “domestic terrorism” and would be dealt with accordingly. At a White House appearance Monday, Trump blamed antifa by name for the violence, along with violent mobs, arsonists and looters. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters earlier in the day that antifa is a “big element of this protest,” though she deferred to the Justice Department on the question of how one could be identified as a member. But it’s unclear how big its involvement is. Bray said that although he believes people associated with antifa are participating in the demonstrations, it is difficult to establish how big of a role they’re playing since there is no official roster of members and since the movement lacks the numbers to mobilize nationwide in such a dramatic, forceful way. “The radical left is much bigger than antifa— much, much bigger — and the number of people who are participating in the property destruction are much, much bigger than the radical left,” Bray said. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. WHAT DOES THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANT TO DO ABOUT ANTIFA? Trump tweeted Sunday, “The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.” It’s not the first time he’s endorsed that approach. Trump expressed a similar sentiment last summer, joining some Republican lawmakers in calling for antifa to be designated as a terror organization after the skirmishes in Portland. CAN THE ADMINISTRATION DO THAT? For one thing, antifa is not a discrete or centralized group, so it’s unclear how the government could give it a designation. Beyond that, though, antifa is a domestic entity and, as such, not a candidate for inclusion on the State Department’s list of foreign terror organizations. Those groups, which include Islamic extremist organizations and the Real Irish Republican Army, are based overseas rather than in the U.S. That designation matters for a variety of legal reasons, not least of which anyone in the United States who lends material support to an organization on that list is subject to terrorism-related charges. But “there is not a domestic equivalent,” said Joshua Geltzer, a former senior counterterrorism official in the Obama White House and founding executive director at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at the Georgetown University Law Center. There have been periodic calls, particularly after mass shootings by white supremacists, to establish a domestic terrorism law. But no singular domestic terrorism statute now exists. Asked Monday what legal authority the president would have for labeling antifa a terror organization, McEnany pointed to the existing statute under the U.S. criminal code that defines acts of domestic and international terrorism. But defining an act of terrorism is different than designating an entire U.S. group as a terror organization. “US law does the 1st. It doesn’t permit the 2nd,” Geltzer tweeted after McEnany’s remarks. Even if antifa is not a designated terror organization, FBI Director Chris Wray has made clear that it’s on the radar of federal law enforcement. He has said that while the FBI does not investigate on the basis of ideology, agents have pursued investigations across the country against people motivated to commit crimes and acts of violence “on kind of an antifa ideology.” ___ Associated Press writers Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Ore., and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

WMRA’s Calvin Pynn reports. As protesters began to show up in downtown Harrisonburg for Monday night’s silent march, around 300 gathered in front of the city’s public safety building for a prayer vigil led by Harrisonburg city councilman Chris Jones. CHRIS JONES: It’s been a long hard 400 years, and our time has been filled with slavery of the worst kind known to man, the raping of women and children, the burning and lynching in public places, which made it so easier for that officer to do that to brother Floyd. This was one of many ongoing protests after George Floyd’s death at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis sparked national outrage at police brutality and racism in America. More than 1,000 people gathered downtown, marching with fists and signs raised in the air. The first half of the silent march stayed true to its name, but chanting erupted and echoed downtown as the crowd moved past city hall. (sound of crowd chanting No Justice! No Peace!) As they circled back around the Public Safety Building, their chants commemorated Floyd, as well as Breonna Taylor, who was killed in March by police in Louisville, Kentucky. (Sound of crowd chanting Say his name! George Floyd!, and, Breonna Taylor!) As the crowd returned to Liberty Park, speakers such as activist Johonna Turner concluded their demonstration. JOHONNA TURNER: I just want to remind us that our movement is global, it is intersectional, and it is visionary. And I just want to say that this movement, in defense of black lives - we don’t just bring our marching bodies, we bring our grieving hearts, we bring our resilient spirits. The march was relatively peaceful with minimal police involvement, and did not escalate into violence as other demonstrations have over the past few days. Local activist Maleke Jones, organized the protest and said to expect more like it in the future. MALEKE JONES: I can just say there will be more. We can’t just do this one time and expect things to change. In order to get real change, we’re gonna have to keep on pushing, keep on demanding, so that’s our plan for the future.",0.0

Lam hit out at the “double standards” of foreign governments over national security, and pointed to recent unrest in America as an example. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu) PARIS (AP) — Tear gas choked Paris streets as riot police faced off with protesters setting fires Tuesday amid growing global outrage over George Floyd’s death in the United States, racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics around the world. French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Police said at least 20,000 people joined the demonstration, defying a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Electric scooters and construction barriers went up in flames, and smoke stained a sign reading “Restaurant Open” — on the first day French cafes were allowed to open after nearly three months of virus lockdown. Chanting “I can’t breathe,” thousands marched peacefully through Australia’s largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union’s top foreign policy official saying the bloc was “shocked and appalled” by Floyd’s death. Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America — and now, beyond. As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries. “This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,” Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, “all blacks live this to a degree.” Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday’s protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden. But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice. As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city’s frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille. The demonstrations were held in honor of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd’s death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases “have strictly nothing to do with each other.” Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore’s death wasn’t linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition. Traore’s family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics — and that his last words were “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe” were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia’s treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. “I’m here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,” said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. “What’s happening in America shines a light on the situation here.” Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere. “We all watch in horror and consternation what’s going on in the United States,” he said after pausing 21 seconds before answering. “But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada.” More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell’s remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd’s death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that “like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.” He underlined that Europeans “support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions.” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd’s death are “understandable and more than legitimate.” “I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,” Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. “It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,” Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., “that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country.” Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color “is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.” ___ Associated Press writers Rick Rycroft in Sydney, Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, Lori Hinnant in Paris, Aritz Parra in Madrid, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Lorne Cook in Brussels, Peter Dejong in The Hague contributed. ___ Follow AP’s latest news about the protests at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

Lam hit out at the ""double standards"" of foreign governments over national security, and pointed to recent unrest in America as an example. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu) HONG KONG – Hong Kong's leader on Tuesday criticized the “double standards” of foreign governments regarding national security, pointing to the current unrest in the United States as an example of how attitudes differ when protests hit home. “We have recently seen these kind of double standards most clearly with the riots in the United States,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said. “We can see how local authorities have reacted. But then last year when we had similar riots in Hong Kong, what was their position?” The U.S., Britain and some other Western democracies sharply criticized police crackdowns on anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year. Lam pointed to more recent criticism of an imminent national security law that many foreign politicians have characterized as Beijing eroding freedoms promised to Hong Kong. “They take their own country’s national security very seriously, but for the security of our country, especially the situation in Hong Kong, they are looking at it through tinted glasses,” she said. Lam will lead a delegation of senior Hong Kong officials to Beijing on Wednesday to present her views on the planned national security laws to Chinese government officials, the Hong Kong government announced. China’s ceremonial legislature last week approved a decision to create national security laws for Hong Kong, aimed at curbing subversive and secessionist activity after the monthslong pro-democracy movement last year that at times resulted in violent clashes between protesters and police. In response to the proposed laws, U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday pledged to “take action to revoke Hong Kong’s preferential treatment as a separate customs and travel territory.” Lam said if any countries imposed sanctions or made moves to affect trading relations, they would only be “hurting their own interests.” She went on to highlight the U.S. trade surplus with Hong Kong. “Foreign governments have been responding in a high-profile manner, some have threatened certain actions, and I can only say that they are adopting double standards,” Lam said. Lam also expressed concern over the latest coronavirus outbreak in the city, after a cluster of nine people in the same public housing building tested positive for the virus over the past few days, ending a streak of nearly two weeks without locally transmitted cases. Hong Kong on Tuesday said it would implement a two-week extension of social distancing measures, including a ban on public gatherings of more than eight people, to June 18. The city's entry restrictions will also remain in place until Sept. 18 for foreign non-residents, with the exception of those who have stayed in mainland China, Taiwan and Macau for 14 days prior to their arrival in Hong Kong. Residents of those places are also allowed into the city if they have not traveled elsewhere prior to their arrival.",0.0

Breonna Taylor, a black woman, was fatally shot by police in her home in March. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings) One man was a retired St. Louis police captain checking on his friend’s shop. Another was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who provided free meals to officers. Yet another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,” a former star football player. They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths, as well as widespread peaceful protests, have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of heavy-handed police tactics, vandalism and arson. Dozens have been injured in the chaos. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: ST. LOUIS A 77-year-old retired St. Louis police captainwho served 38 years on the force was shot and killed by looters at a pawn shop early Tuesday, authorities said. David Dorn was found dead on the sidewalk in front of the ransacked store. Police have not released details about what led to the shooting, and no one has been arrested. The shooting apparently was streamed on Facebook Live but has been taken down. It came on a violent night in St. Louis, which saw four officers shot, businesses burned and ransacked, and people pelting officers with rocks hours following a peaceful protest. Dorn was a friend of the pawn shop’s owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, wife Ann Marie Dorn told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. David Dorn’s personality was “bigger than life,” said former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch. “He was a fun guy, a happy guy.” Dorn retired in October 2007 and then became police chief of Moline Acres, a small town north of St. Louis. ___ LOUISVILLE Police and the National Guard troops trying to clear a crowd Monday heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. “We lost a wonderful citizen,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.” Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said Tuesday that video from security cameras at McAtee’s business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gunas officers approached. “This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,” Schroeder said. The protests also have centered on the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her Louisville home in March as narcotics detectives serving a search warrant knocked down her door. No drugs were found. ___ OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal officer was providing security at a U.S. courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It wasn’t immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. No one has been arrested. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers employed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service. They were monitoring a nearby protest. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant congressional seat north of Los Angeles. ___ INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as “Mr. Indianapolis” and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after graduation. He also was a prominent businessman, running multiple nightclubs. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.” The circumstances of Beaty’s shooting weren’t immediately clear, but some media reports said it happened near his apartment. It came the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. ___ DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because a protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kansas. No arrests have been made. “She was always smiling, always laughing. That’s why it’s so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,” Hale said. “That is not Italia. She was the bright, bubbly big personality in the room.” Separately, authorities said an officer was “ambushed” with gunfire Sunday. Another officer shot back, and the suspects fled but were arrested. Near where the officer was wounded, police found a man shot to death and a handgun under his body. His identity wasn’t released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other, police said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest. ___ OMAHA, NEBRASKA James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man, was killed Saturday after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two downtown bars. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including Scurlock, approach white bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people shove Gardner to the ground, and he fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen jumping on Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges in the death, calling the shooting self-defense.

Mariann Budde “outraged.” Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington D.C., spoke with CNN shortly after the photo-op, saying, “Let me be clear, the president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus.” President Trump had just addressed the nation, calling himself “your president of law and order” and vowing to “dominate the streets.” Video showed officers in protective gear forcibly removing a large crowd of peaceful demonstrators from the area between the White House and the church. “(Trump) sanctioned the use of tear gas by police officers in riot gear to clear the church yard,” Budde said. “I am outraged. The president did not pray when he came to St. John’s, nor … did he acknowledge the agony of our country right now.” Trump, flanked by members of his administration, held the Bible before cameras as he posed in front of the boarded-up church across from the White House. Budde said Trump failed in particular to address the suffering of “the people of color in our nation, who wonder if anyone ever – anyone in public power will ever acknowledge their sacred words – and who are rightfully demanding an end to 400 years of systemic racism and supremacy in our country.” Latest Stories Get breaking news, weather, and sports delivered to your smartphone with the WFXR News app available on Apple and Android.",0.0

(WKRN) —- On Monday, hundreds joined forces for a peaceful protest at the Tennessee state capitol, voicing their anger with the death of George Floyd. Organizer and refugee, Kayo Beshir, told News 2 that their goal is to achieve change in peaceful way. He referenced the riots that took place in Nashville on Saturday night, as a distraction to the peaceful message that was shared during the ‘I Will Breathe’ rally earlier on the same day. During Monday’s demonstration, the crowd sang hymnals, chanted, and called for action against what they called, unjust policing. Some shared their Christian faith, asking for others of faith to support and advocate for change. “We recognize that Jesus’ death was both a sacrifice and a murder, and when you identify it as a murder we have a responsibility to be out here demanding justice for acts of cruelty and acts of violence,” said Russell Pointer, Jr., a pastor. Activist and Reverend, Justin Jones said the turmoil won’t end until racist institutions are dismantled and new legislation protects against unjust policing. At one point during the event, people walked in groups of two up to the state capitol. Some state representatives held up the barrier tape allowing protesters to pass through. Once at the top of the capitol, protesters asked the Tennessee National Guard to drop their shields and they did. The crowd exploded in cheers and someone said through a megaphone, “We want to thank our National Guard for being on the right side of history.” Jones called their actions, a divine occurrence, “a movement of faith for them to put down their swords and shields, because we came up here singing and we came up here prayerful.

Mayor Levar Stoney condemned the destruction, which has played out in cities across the country following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. Stoney announced Sunday morning that Gov. Ralph Northam had granted his request for a curfew and said the National Guard was on standby to help enforce it. Police said one person in a vehicle was shot by a protester and the victim is in life-threatening condition.

The crowd left the area as a mass of state police officers approached, heading west to the city’s police headquarters, where the night before protesters had set a police cruiser on fire and broken out windows.

At least two businesses burned, including a shoe store and a Rite Aid pharmacy that workers had been attempting to board up as the protest began. The sharpest clashes broke out east of Broad and Belvidere in Richmond’s arts district between 1:30 and 2:30 a.m., where protesters lit numerous fires, including a large barricade of trash cans and dumpsters.

At a memorial for Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, a noose was left hanging around the bronze figure’s neck. Down the street, a fire burned inside the headquarters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, a group that helped erect Confederate memorials around the South and promoted the Lost Cause interpretation of the Civil War that “emphasized states’ rights and secession over slavery as causes of the war and was often used to further the goals of white supremacists in the twentieth century,” according to Encyclopedia Virginia. click to enlarge Scott Elmquist The J.E.B.

One bystander who lives in the neighborhood, a self-described Yankee named James, told Style Weekly that a large crowd of protesters attacked the headquarters, picking up barriers, spray-painting the building and throwing “some kind of incendiary device” into a window.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) Joe Biden is on the cusp of formally securing the Democratic presidential nomination after winning hundreds more delegates in primary contests Tuesday that tested the nation’s ability to run elections while balancing a pandemic and sweeping social unrest. Biden could lock down the nomination within the next week as West Virginia and Georgia hold primaries. On Tuesday, voters across America were forced to navigate curfews, health concerns and National Guard troops — waiting in line hours after polls closed in some cases — after election officials dramatically reduced the number of in-person voting sites to minimize the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden and President Donald Trump easily swept their respective primary contests that ranged from Maryland to Montana and featured the night’s biggest prize: Pennsylvania. The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the monthslong state-by-state primary season. Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March. Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday’s largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. “Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said. Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday’s primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party. The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment. Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests. Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. “Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump’s repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines. “We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.” Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year. In Iowa, Republican Rep. Steve King, known nationally for controversial remarks, lost his bid to be nominated for a 10th term to state Sen. Randy Feenstra. House Republicans stripped King of his committee assignments in 2019 after comments that seemed to defend white nationalism, providing fuel for Feenstra’s argument that King was no longer an effective representative for the 4th District. In a New Mexico race for an open House seat, ex-CIA operative Valerie Plame lost the Democratic primary to attorney Teresa Leger Fernandez, a professional advocate for Native American communities and voting rights issues. A first-time candidate for public office, Plame harnessed her fame as the operative whose secret identity was exposed shorty after her diplomat husband disputed U.S. intelligence used to justify the 2003 Iraq invasion. ___ Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi in Providence, R.I., and Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",0.0

(WFXR) — While new data from the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) shows a significant drop in the total number of COVID-19 cases around the Commonwealth, this weekend’s large protests have lead to fears of a resurgence of the virus. VDH’s tally on Monday, June 1 reported 791 new coronavirus cases across Virginia, which is a lower increase than other days in the last week, during which health officials reported more than 1,000 new cases each day. However, with large numbers of Virginians gathering over the past few days to protest the death of George Floyd — as well as other black Americans — at the hands of police officers, health officials say cases resulting from those demonstrations are not likely to surface for about two weeks. WFXR News reached out to Dr. Molly O’Dell, the director of communicable disease control for the Roanoke City and Alleghany Health Districts, about VDH’s concerns regarding potential COVID-19 spread following the numerous large gatherings this weekend. According to Dr. O’Dell, “protests without the use of social distancing and face covering is another form of gathering where outbreaks can occur. Parties are another form.

1623284348,2020-06-02 09:35:56,Biden to hit Trump as more focused on 'power than principle',https://www.wsls.com/news/politics/2020/06/02/hate-just-hides-biden-vows-to-take-on-systematic-racism/,en,False,,90694,wsls.com,http://www.wsls.com/#spider,"WILMINGTON, Del. – Joe Biden mounted one of his most aggressive attacks against President Donald Trump on Tuesday, deriding the commander in chief's disregard of core constitutional values and blistering him for being “more interested in power than in principle.” “He thinks division helps him,” the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said in a speech at Philadelphia’s City Hall. “This narcissism has become more important than the nation’s well-being.” Biden seized on police driving back peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday so Trump could briefly pose with a Bible in front of nearby St. John’s Church. “If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something,"" Biden said as he chided authorities for using “tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op."" Biden said Trump ""might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he’d find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway denied that the president directed authorities' actions to move back the protesters and bristled at suggestions the church visit was merely a photo op. She countered that Biden and other critics had no basis to second-guess what was in the president's heart and his intentions. Still, Biden’s address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for more than two months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he's been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden spoke as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd’s death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the “tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.” “The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,"" he said. Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a “battle for the soul of the nation.” He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. “I ask every American to look at where we are now and think anew: Is this who we are?” he said. “Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids’ and grandkids’ lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?” The tone was part of Biden's effort to cast himself as a “consoler in chief"" in stark contrast to Trump's blunt, confrontational style. While he noted that his anguish over the death of his son Beau five years ago from cancer isn't the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. “Like many of you, I know what it’s like to grieve,” Biden said. “I know what it feels like when you’re thinking you can’t go on.” He said “bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly” and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. The former vice president called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using chokeholds. Biden also promised that, if elected, he would increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic. But Biden's speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity, even though his criticism of Trump is common. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it “is crying out for leadership.” “This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,” Biden said, adding that Trump is “consumed with his blinding ego.” Biden offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted Tuesday that Washington “had no problems last night” and cited “many arrests,” as well as “overwhelming force” and “Domination,” for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a “president of law and order,"" and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president's reelection campaign, said Biden's speech “obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.” “President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,” Pierson said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation's differences. He was careful to note that his administration won't be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. “I know that the presidency, that's a very big job,"" he said. “Nobody will get it right every time, and I won't either."" But he vowed not to “traffic in fear and division."" “I won't fan the flames of hate,” Biden said.

Another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest. Several thousand demonstrators gather in Oakland, Calif., on Monday, June 1, 2020, to protest the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (Source: AP Photo/Noah Berger) They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of unrest, from heavy-handed police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. Dozens of others have been injured in the chaos, with police officers getting shot and protesters struck with rubber bullets. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: LOUISVILLE As police and the National Guard troops sought to clear a crowd Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. “We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.” Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said Tuesday that video from security cameras at McAtee’s business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gun as officers approached. “This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,” Schroeder said. The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd’s killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they tried to serve a search warrant. No drugs were found. ___ OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal law enforcement officer was providing security at a federal courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers employed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service. They were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested, and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional seat north of Los Angeles. ___ INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as “Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after graduating. He also was a prominent businessman in the city, running multiple nightclubs. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together."" The circumstances of his shooting weren't immediately clear, but some media reports said it happened near his apartment. This death occurred the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. ___ DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. The circumstances of Kelly’s death are murky, and no arrests have been made. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because the protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kansas. “She was always smiling, always laughing. That’s why it’s so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,” Hale said. “That is not Italia. She was the bright, bubbly big personality in the room.” Separately, authorities said an officer patrolling Sunday was “ambushed” with gunfire. Another officer shot back, and the suspects fled. Their vehicle crashed, and they were arrested. Near where the officer was shot, police found a man dead from a gunshot next to a vehicle. Police say they found a handgun underneath his body. His identity has not been released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other and fled, police said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest. ___ OMAHA, NEBRASKA James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man, was killed Saturday after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two downtown bars. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including Scurlock, approach white bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people shove Gardner to the ground, and he fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen jumping on Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges in the death, calling the shooting self-defense. But Gardner could still face misdemeanor gun charges because his concealed carry permit for the gun had expired, the police chief said. ___ DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone opened fire and then ran away. ___ SUBURBAN CHICAGO Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the suburb of Cicero, according to a town official.

(Nicholas Kamm/Pool Photo via AP) WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday marked this week's anniversary of China's deadly 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square — a day after federal forces used tear gas to clear peaceful protesters from a park in front of the White House. Pompeo tweeted criticism of China and Hong Kong for barring a vigil to mark the anniversary before he met privately with a group of Tiananmen Square survivors at the State Department. A senior department official confirmed the meeting took place but could not say how many survivors attended or what was discussed. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. President Donald Trump has threatened to call in the military to quell violent protests in the United States. Federal forces on Monday aggressively cleared protesters from Lafayette Park outside the White House so Trump could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. The Trump administration has stepped up its anti-China rhetoric over Beijing’s response to the coronavirus outbreak and its moves to impose greater control over Hong Kong. Trump and Pompeo last week said Hong Kong is no longer autonomous and will be stripped of its preferential trade and commercial status. Pompeo began the day by firing off a tweet criticizing China for blocking the annual Tiananmen Square vigil in Hong Kong on June 4, the anniversary of the assault on protesters by the People's Liberation Army. The decision to bar the vigil ostensibly on health grounds due to the COVID-19 pandemic comes just a week after China's rubber stamp parliament enacted a new security law for the former British colony that many fear will be used to curtail freedoms the territory has enjoyed since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. “It starts; so soon,"" Pompeo said in a tweet. ""For the first time in 30 years, Hong Kong authorities denied permission to hold the #TiananmenVigil. If there is any doubt about Beijing’s intent, it is to deny Hong Kongers a voice and a choice, making them the same as mainlanders. So much for two systems.” The Hong Kong vigil draws a huge crowd to an outdoor space every year. As Pompeo met with the Tiananmen survivors, three State Department officials were playing down the impact of Trump's decision last week to ban Chinese graduate students and researchers with links to the People's Liberation Army or other security services from the United States. The officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity under State Department rules, were unable to say or estimate how many people would be affected by the ban, which has drawn strong criticism from Beijing. The officials all said that the number affected would be “very low” and the U.S. would continue to welcome the vast majority of Chinese students who want to study at American universities. One of the officials said the impact of the ban would be “more of a scalpel than a baseball bat” and stressed that the U.S. recognized the value that Chinese students bring to the United States. The U.S. hosted 133,396 graduate students from China in the 2018-19 academic year, and they made up 36.1% of all international graduate students, according to the Institute of International Education. Only a small fraction would be affected, the officials said. Earlier Tuesday in Beijing, China's foreign ministry lashed out at the ban, which Trump announced on Friday and is intended to curb what U.S. officials say is widespread espionage and intellectual property theft by Chinese students and researchers. “The United States abused the national security concept and introduced measures to restrict visas on unwarranted charges for Chinese students studying in the States,” said ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, “It seriously infringes the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students studying abroad, completely violates the common aspiration of both the Chinese and American peoples.”",0.0

One of the most famous examples was in the 1968 Olympics when black athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos each raised a fist on the podium after medaling in the 200 meter race while the Star Spangled Banner was being played. According to History.com, their raised black-gloved fists represented their “solidarity and support with black people and oppressed people around the world.” They also stood in “black-socked feet without shoes to bring attention to black poverty, [and wore] beads to protest lynchings.” The third man on the podium was Australian Peter Norman, who didn’t raise his fist but joined them in wearing a badge for the Olympic Project for Human rights All faced intense backlash.

(WKRN) —- Hundreds joined forces Monday for a peaceful protest at the Tennessee state capitol, voicing their anger over the death of George Floyd. Organizer and refugee Kayo Beshir said their goal is to achieve change in a peaceful way. He referenced the riots that took place in Nashville on Saturday night as a distraction to the peaceful message that was shared during the ‘I will Breathe’ rally earlier on the same day. During Monday’s demonstration, the crowd sang hymnals, chanted and called for action against what they called unjust policing. Some shared their Christian faith, asking for others of faith to support and advocate for change. “We recognize that Jesus’ death was both a sacrifice and a murder, and when you identify it as a murder, we have a responsibility to be out here demanding justice for acts of cruelty and acts of violence,” said pastor Russell Pointer Jr. Activist and Reverend Justin Jones said the turmoil won’t end until racist institutions are dismantled and new legislation protects against unjust policing. At one point during the event, people walked in groups of two up to the state capitol. Some state representatives held up barrier tape allowing protesters to pass. Once at the top of the capitol, protestors asked the Tennessee National Guard to drop their shields, and they did. The crowd exploded in cheers and someone said through a megaphone, “We want to thank our National Guard for being on the right side of history.” Jones called their actions a divine occurrence. “It was a movement of faith for them to put down their swords and shields because we came up here singing and we came up here prayerful. We are here to bring peace and change.” Latest Posts",0.0
1623330853,2020-06-02 00:21:00,"Live: Biden delivering remarks on protests, Trump",https://www.wavy.com/news/politics/hate-just-hides-biden-vows-to-take-on-systematic-racism/,en,True,,70270,wavy.com,http://www.wavy.com/#spider,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Joe Biden mounted one of his most aggressive attacks against President Donald Trump on Tuesday, deriding the commander in chief’s disregard of core constitutional values and blistering him for being “more interested in power than in principle.” “He thinks division helps him,” the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said in a speech at Philadelphia’s City Hall. “This narcissism has become more important than the nation’s well-being.” Biden seized on police driving back peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday so Trump could briefly pose with a Bible in front of nearby St. John’s Church. “If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something,” Biden said as he chided authorities for using “tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op.” Biden said Trump “might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he’d find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway denied that the president directed authorities’ actions to move back the protesters and bristled at suggestions the church visit was merely a photo op. She countered that Biden and other critics had no basis to second-guess what was in the president’s heart and his intentions. Still, Biden’s address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for more than two months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he’s been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden spoke as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd’s death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the “tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.” “The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,” he said. Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a “battle for the soul of the nation.” He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. “I ask every American to look at where we are now and think anew: Is this who we are?” he said. “Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids’ and grandkids’ lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?” The tone was part of Biden’s effort to cast himself as a “consoler in chief” in stark contrast to Trump’s blunt, confrontational style. While he noted that his anguish over the death of his son Beau five years ago from cancer isn’t the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. “Like many of you, I know what it’s like to grieve,” Biden said. “I know what it feels like when you’re thinking you can’t go on.” He said “bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly” and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. The former vice president called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using chokeholds. Biden also promised that, if elected, he would increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic. But Biden’s speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity, even though his criticism of Trump is common. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it “is crying out for leadership.” “This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,” Biden said, adding that Trump is “consumed with his blinding ego.” Biden offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted Tuesday that Washington “had no problems last night” and cited “many arrests,” as well as “overwhelming force” and “Domination,” for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a “president of law and order,” and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president’s reelection campaign, said Biden’s speech “obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.” “President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,” Pierson said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation’s differences. He was careful to note that his administration won’t be able to fix everything, especially not all at once. “I know that the presidency, that’s a very big job,” he said. “Nobody will get it right every time, and I won’t either.” But he vowed not to “traffic in fear and division.” “I won’t fan the flames of hate,” Biden said. “I’ll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not use them for political gain.” ___ Weissert reported from Washington. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",0.0

""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. ""More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that's what the presidency is: the duty to care — to care for all of us."" On Monday evening, Trump walked from the White House across Lafayette Square to hold a Bible in front of St. John's Church, after peaceful protesters were forcibly cleared from the park. (The U.S. Park Police say they used smoke canisters, not tear gas, though it's not clear if another law enforcement agency engaged there used other munitions.) The forceful dispersal began before the Washington, D.C., curfew had begun, and the bishop overseeing the church has harshly criticized Trump for appearing for photos without praying or addressing the racial issues at the heart of nationwide protests. Trump made the trip after making a speech in which he threatened to deploy the military to states and cities that do not quell violence. ""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it,"" Biden said. ""If he opened it, he could have learned something: that we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump isn't interested in doing that work."" Biden echoed the words spoken by George Floyd, the black man whose death while in custody of Minneapolis police has led to the widespread unrest. The words ""I can't breathe,"" Biden said, ""are a wake-up call for our nation."" Biden addressed police abuses and economic disparities that affect what he called ""communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time"" — alluding to the since-charged police officer who had his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. ""The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism,"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said. He asked Congress to take up measures he called ""a down payment on what is long overdue,"" including police reform bills outlawing chokeholds, banning the transfer of military weapons to police forces and establishing a uniform use of force standard. He said he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president. Biden also called for expanding the Affordable Care Act to millions more Americans, saying that Trump, who has long opposed the law, is ""consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to [former President] Barack Obama."" Obama's former vice president reiterated what he has long said on the 2020 campaign trail, that there is a ""battle for the soul of America."" ""Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears,"" Biden said. ""He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being that he leads. ""The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either,"" Biden said. ""But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate."" In a statement following his remarks, Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign adviser, said Biden has ""obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy."" She added: ""Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has used the politics of racial division when they suited his needs and he is doing it again."" On Monday, Biden held his first in-person campaign event since the coronavirus took hold in the United States in mid-March. He met with African American faith leaders in Wilmington, Del., listening to at-times critical feedback from the group. Many of the invited guests chided Biden for a political system that has delivered ""hopelessness"" to young African Americans. They told him the Obama administration had not done enough to economically lift black Americans, something Biden then promised would be a centerpiece of any recovery plan from the administration.

At 11 p.m. Monday, our crew watched as the police line advanced toward the crowd, many of whom dispersed while others continued to not follow orders to go home. Officers used tear gas on the crowd several times throughout the night on Monday, as the gathering shifted from peaceful to more chaotic. Several protesters threw water bottles and fireworks toward police, while other protesters told them not to, and tried to keep the protest peaceful and nonviolent. A curfew was in effect from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Monday night in Tuesday morning. That same curfew will be in effect on Tuesday, but police will be able to enforce it. A violation is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Several officers are hurt and two people were arrested after peaceful protests turned violent Sunday night into Monday morning in Lynchburg. Demonstrations started Sunday afternoon outside of Fifth and Federal, a Lynchburg restaurant that supported a tweet from Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. that showed a picture of a face mask with the blackface photo from Gov. Northam’s yearbook page on it. The business has since issued a statement apologizing to anyone who thought they were supporting racism. Rather, they, ""stand for freedom from the oppressive government actions of Governor Northam.” Demonstrations were originally focused on the restaurant’s response to Falwell’s tweet, but then shifted to George Floyd and the treatment of African Americans. Later on, protests became violent. Protesters were seen throwing rocks into Adams Motor Company and destroying property.

(AP Photo/Brian Inganga) NAIROBI – Residents of a slum in Kenya's capital have protested the death of a homeless man who they said was killed by police for violating a dusk-to-dawn curfew for the coronavirus. Hundreds of people in Mathare left their homes and burnt tires on the streets Monday night in the latest outrage over alleged police brutality. Dominic Njagi said he couldn't understand why police shot his brother, 51-year-old James Mureithi. “The pathologist I talked to said my brother was shot twice; one on the legs and the other on the chest,” Njagi told The Associated Press. “The pathologist said the chest wound was at close range."" He said Mureithi was a university-educated automotive engineer who suffered a mental breakdown after divorcing his wife 10 years ago. Police did not respond to a request for comment. Local elder Stephen Wesonga said Mureithi was well-known in the slum as he used to walk around collecting recyclables to sell. Rights activist Boniface Mwangi asserted that 19 Kenyans have died from police actions in enforcing the COVID-19 curfew, all from low-income neighborhoods. He said the Kenyan deaths and the global protests over the killing of George Floyd in the U.S. show that “struggles against police brutality are the same everywhere.” People are more afraid of the police than COVID-19, Mwangi said. He said activists are planning demonstrations and had hesitated before because they feared arrest that could lead to six months in jail for illegal assembly — or 14 days in a quarantine facility. A statement Tuesday by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority, established by Parliament, said 15 deaths and 31 incidents where people sustained injuries have been directly linked to actions of police officers during curfew enforcement. The authority said it has dispatched teams to investigate another six deaths allegedly linked to the police since May 29, including that of Mureithi. Also Tuesday, Kenya's director of public prosecution ordered the arrest and prosecution of a police officer in the death of 13-year-old Yasin Hussein Moyo, who was shot dead while standing on his family's balcony in March as police moved through his crowded neighborhood enforcing the curfew.

(WPRI) — Violence and destruction erupted in downtown Providence overnight which resulted in dozens of arrests, several police officers hurt, businesses looted and a police cruiser being torched. Gov. Gina Raimondo and other state and city officials held a news conference late Tuesday morning to address what happened. She began by reminding the public how proud she was to be a Rhode Islander after seeing and hearing about the peaceful protests held over the weekend. “I stand before you disheartened, dismayed, outraged, and angry at the events that we saw last night right here in the city of Providence,” Raimondo said. “Make no mistake about it, what we saw last night was not a protest, what we saw last night was an organized attack on our community at a time when we are already vulnerable.” (Story continues below.) The governor noted how people showed up armed with crowbars, gasoline, flares and other items to intentionally hurt people and destroy property. Having seen the damage to businesses that are just reopening after being shuttered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Raimondo assured the owners that the state will help get them back on their feet. She also announced she’s activating the R.I. National Guard to assist state and local police in the coming days. Mayor Jorge Elorza announced late Tuesday afternoon that he has issued a citywide curfew beginning Tuesday night. Elorza said the curfew, which will be in place until June 9, will begin at 9 p.m. and end at 6 a.m. “This is not a decision that we take lightly and this is not a decision we make easily,” Elorza said. (Story continues below.) Both Warwick and Cranston have also issued citywide curfews beginning at 8 p.m. after reports of “planned violence” surfaced on social media. Central Falls and Pawtucket soon followed suit – issuing an 8:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, after hearing similar reports about their communities. East Providence also issued a citywide curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. In a statement, the Rhode Island ACLU said called the curfews “an extraordinary and overly broad action that, ironically, can only promote the types of discriminatory police actions that have prompted peaceful protests this past week.” It all started when hundreds of people gathered outside the mall to demand justice for George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died in police custody after an officer kneeled on his neck while he was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe. The incident was captured on video and has since sparked protests around the country. Rhode Island State Police Col. James Manni said he received a tip around dinner time Monday of a “planned disturbance,” calling it a coordinated attack by anarchists trying to come into the city and take it over. As a result of the tip, Elorza said the mall decided to close at 7 p.m. instead of 10 p.m. and city police were on alert. Elorza said even though police were in place ahead of time, the number of people was almost impossible to stop. By 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, throngs of people blocked off Francis Street, meeting a line of officers in the middle. Police continuously tried to clear the area but were met with resistance. (Story continues below.) The situation escalated when they stormed the mall with officers giving chase. People could be seen running toward storefronts on the first floor, looting and causing damage. Officers were seen working hastily to block off the entrances to the mall. Police said about 200 to 300 people were trying to get inside but only about 75 to 100 were successful. More than a dozen businesses inside the mall were looted and vandalized, according to police. The mall had just reopened to customers on Monday after it was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tentatively reopening Saturday. — Steph Machado (@StephMachado) June 2, 2020 Police said the looters were not inside the mall for long, since they were able to drive them out toward Cranston Street. In total, Elorza said 65 people were arrested, of which 35 were from Providence, five were from Massachusetts, and the rest were from other Rhode Island cities and towns. (Story continues below.) Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven Paré told Eyewitness News that nine police officers and troopers were injured after bricks were thrown at them. Four were from the Providence Police Department and five were from the Rhode Island State Police. Some of the officers were treated for minor injuries on scene while others declined treatment. Paré said police deployed “less than lethal tear gas” when a large number of people started throwing bricks and other objects at officers. (Story continues below.) Around 1 a.m., people began targeting police cruisers; they could be seen smashing the windshield and windows of one outside the mall before lighting it on fire. Officials said five cruisers were damaged in all, including the one that was set ablaze. The crowd eventually dispersed outside the mall, however, looting and vandalism continued elsewhere in the city. (Story continues below.)

Another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,” a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest. They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of unrest, from heavy-handed police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. Hundreds of others have been injured in the chaos, with police officers getting shot and protesters struck with rubber bullets. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: LOUISVILLE As police and the National Guard troops sought to clear a crowd Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. in an attempt to disperse crowds, #DavidMcAtee, a louisville bbq chef known for serving cops free meals, was shot and killed by the police last night. he was unarmed. not only were the officers’ bodycams off, but they also left his body on the street for 12 hours. say his name. pic.twitter.com/kqOPku8iuQ — adaliah 🇹🇬 (@adxlls) June 2, 2020 “We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.” Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said Tuesday that video from security cameras at McAtee’s business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gun as officers approached. “This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,” Schroeder said. The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd’s killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they tried to serve a search warrant. No drugs were found. OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal law enforcement officer was providing security at a federal courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. Dave Patrick Underwood was shot and killed in what appears to be a driveby shooting.

They were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested, and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional seat north of Los Angeles. INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as “Mr. Indianapolis” and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after graduating. He also was a prominent businessman in the city, running multiple nightclubs.

His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.” The circumstances of his shooting weren’t immediately clear, but some media reports said it happened near his apartment. This death occurred the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. The circumstances of Kelly’s death are murky, and no arrests have been made. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because the protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kansas. “She was always smiling, always laughing. That’s why it’s so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,” Hale said. “That is not Italia. She was the bright, bubbly big personality in the room.” Italia Kelly lost her life last night while protesting in Davenport, Iowa.

Another officer shot back, and the suspects fled. Their vehicle crashed, and they were arrested. Near where the officer was shot, police found a man dead from a gunshot next to a vehicle. Police say they found a handgun underneath his body. His identity has not been released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other and fled, police said. MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest.

(WAVY) — Virginia Beach police said 26 people were arrested during the second straight night of protests in the city. It was one of several protests that broke out Monday throughout Hampton Roads, as people continue to protest police brutality in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. In a press release sent early Monday morning, police said that they made 26 arrests during demonstrations at the Virginia Beach Town Center, but didn’t say what the charges entailed. They said more information would be released later Tuesday. Police shut down roads around the Town Center for the protests, which continued past the city’s 8 p.m. curfew authorized by Gov.

The bishop who oversees St. John's is among the critics. ""He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR's Morning Edition. ""He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation."" ""He did not pray,"" the bishop continued. ""He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate ... represent."" Every president since James Madison has visited St. John's Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday's visit. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" Budde told NPR's Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. ""I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,"" the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John's a few minutes after Washington's just-installed 7 p.m. curfew began. The federal force used against the demonstrators nearly 30 minutes before the curfew began incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""Shameful!"" Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after ""federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,"" the city's police force's job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult. I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!  DC residents — Go home. Be safe — Muriel Bowser (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020 When the federal force rushed at protesters outside the White House, journalists were also pushed out. Officers attacked Australian reporter Amelia Brace and also hit cameraman Tim Myers, prompting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call for an investigation. The scene played out on live TV, during Australia's breakfast-time Sunrise show. ""While live on air, Myers was struck in the chest by a riot shield and Brace was clubbed with a police baton,"" Australia's 7NEWS reports. ""Our Ambassador should be certainly making representations on behalf of these Australians who effectively been assaulted...for doing their job"" - Leader of the @AustralianLabor Party @AlboMP speaking after @Channel7 journalist & cameraman were hit. https://t.co/rCG56KbYRw #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/CUslYLfYes — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) June 2, 2020 Brace tells Australia's ABC that she repeatedly identified herself as a journalist as officers quickly closed in on them during the rush to clear a path for Trump. ""Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,"" she says. ""We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to ... and then we ended up getting tear-gassed."" The situation, she said, was ""absolutely terrifying."" ""I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we'll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we're feeling perfectly safe,"" Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, ""Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously."" Trump's use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation's capital. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" ""All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,"" Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement. While Budde is thankful to first responders who put out that fire, she says she wants the focus to remain on the death of George Floyd and others who have died at the hands of police. ""I want to acknowledge the loss of property, but in no way equate it with the loss of life,"" she said. ""I want to be a church that stands in solidarity with those who are making peaceful protest."" : 6/01/20 An earlier version of this Web story mistakenly said that President Trump walked to St. John's Church nearly 30 minutes before Washington's 7 p.m. curfew began. In fact, he walked there a few minutes after the curfew began.",0.0

Pelosi invoked Biblical scripture to reject Trump's clampdown on peaceful protesters outside the White House and she drew on past presidents "" including George H.W. Bush in the aftermath of the Rodney King unrest and Barack Obama following the death of Eric Garner "" as models of the nation's chief executive at a time of crisis. 'We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many presidents before him to be a healer in chief and not a fanner of the flame,' Pelosi said. As pleas for reconciliation over the country's long struggle with racial inequality were met with demands for accountability over George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis, there was a shifting tone coming from Congress. Gone are the days when 'Black Lives Matter' protests were met simply with 'Blue Lives Matter' retorts in support of law enforcement. Instead, Congress seems to have heard the protesters outside its doors. 'You can understand the outrage,' McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, said. McConnell said it's not only the death of Floyd at the hands of white police in Minnesota drawing protesters into the streets, but of other African Americans including Breonna Taylor in his home-state of Kentucky. 'There is no question that there is residual racism in America,' McConnell told reporters. 'It's been a longtime dilemma and we all wish we could get to a better place.' As the world watches a nation in turmoil, Democrats and some Republicans are swiftly preparing inquiries into the president's actions against the protesters and a legislative response to the police violence and racial inequality at the heart of marches erupting in communities nationwide. Trump was widely criticized for clearing protesters late Monday from outside the White House so he could walk across the street to hold up a Bible outside historic St. John's church. It was viewed as a photo opportunity and criticized by the congregation's bishop. McConnell declined to directly comment on Trump's handling of the crisis. However, several Republicans on Tuesday suggested it would be better if Trump helped calm the nation rather than escalate the already tense conditions in Washington and across the country. 'I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,' said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, in a statement. 'Every public servant in America should be lowering the temperature.' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called on Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to refuse the use of military helicopters and tear gas for 'ugly stunts' like the one Monday. Senate Democrats proposed, and Republicans rejected, a resolution condemning the president's actions. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, said he was 'glad the president led' by clearing the protesters from the park. Cruz and other Republicans blamed outside agitators from the 'Antifa' anti-fascist movement from intervening in otherwise peaceful protests that resulted in looting and other property damage. Still, for a growing number of lawmakers there is an undeniable pattern of inequality in the treatment of black Americans by law enforcement they want to address. Several Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, called Floyd's death a 'murder.' One, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said he understood there's a difference between his experience telling his sons to call the police if they need help and black families warning children to be cautious around law enforcement so as not to risk being harmed. 'That's a different kind of America and I think people are understanding those protests make sense,' Blunt said. More than 40 bills "" from banning police choke holds and racial profiling to preventing the federal transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement to a long-sought federal anti-lynching law "" are now under consideration on Capitol Hill. One House Democrat probed the Secret Service for any communication about Trump's ordering the clampdown on protesters outside the White House. Using words like 'dictator' 'fascist' and other terms to describe Trump's actions against the protesters, Democrats pleaded with Americans to stand with those working to improve police treatment of minority populations. 'Racism is bad for everyone,' said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California. She and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., among the nation's few black senators post-Reconstruction, spoke of their own childhoods growing up in Civil Rights era, a legacy of the nation's long path toward a more inclusive and representative government. At the Capitol still partly closed by the coronavirus, a Congress that has already struggled with the COVID-19 outbreak that is disproportionately striking black Americans, is now confronting a deepening crisis. The Congressional Black Caucus announced a virtual town hall Friday with civil rights leaders, and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler said the panel is planning a hearing next week on policing, officials said. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said House lawmakers could be recalled to Washington this month to vote on legislation to address police and other reeforms. Schumer urged McConnell to consider law enforcement reforms legislation by July 4. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report.",0.0

The city took down the more than 50-foot-tall obelisk following protests over the police death of George Floyd and a night of vandalism in the city. (AP Photo/Jay Reeves) BIRMINGHAM, Ala. – Sarah Collins Rudolph thought she'd never see what happened in her hometown: Prompted by protests, the city removed a 115-year-old Confederate monument near where her sister and three other black girls died in a racist church bombing in 1963. A wave of Confederate memorial removals that began after a white supremacist killed nine black people at a Bible study in a church in South Carolina in 2015 is again rolling, with more relics of the Old South being removed from public view after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. In Birmingham, where Rudolph lives, the graffiti-covered, pocked base of a massive Confederate monument was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces overnight. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal in Virginia and a bare flagpole in Florida. Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church, had to see the sight for herself. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the absence of an edifice she long considered a symbol of oppression. “I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long, and we know that it's a hate monument,” said Rudolph, 69. “It didn't represent the blacks. It just represented the hard times back there a long time ago.” Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death in police custody in Minneapolis. Now, even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham took down the obelisk a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests. Crews were preparing to finish the job by pulling up the base. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state, which passed a law to protect Confederate icons after rebel monuments were challenged and removed following the killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the city of Birmingham, seeking to fine the city $25,000 for violating the state law. Mayor Randall Woodfin said earlier this week that the fine was more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Online fundraising drives have raised more than enough money to pay the fine. The state lawsuit does not specifically ask Birmingham to restore the monument. Work to remove the monument began Monday, which was Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him. Four people were arrested on criminal mischief charges, and the toppled statue was removed. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city’s only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled “Appomattox,” it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying “Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving.” In Birmingham, Rudolph saw the removal of the monument as unfinished business from decades ago.

(WPRI) — Violence and destruction erupted in downtown Providence overnight which resulted in dozens of arrests, several police officers hurt, businesses looted and a police cruiser being torched. Gov. Gina Raimondo and other state and city officials held a news conference late Tuesday morning to address what happened. She began by reminding the public how proud she was to be a Rhode Islander after seeing and hearing about the peaceful protests held over the weekend. “I stand before you disheartened, dismayed, outraged, and angry at the events that we saw last night right here in the city of Providence,” Raimondo said. “Make no mistake about it, what we saw last night was not a protest, what we saw last night was an organized attack on our community at a time when we are already vulnerable.” (Story continues below.) The governor noted how people showed up armed with crowbars, gasoline, flares and other items to intentionally hurt people and destroy property. Having seen the damage to businesses that are just reopening after being shuttered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Raimondo assured the owners that the state will help get them back on their feet. She also announced she’s activating the R.I. National Guard to assist state and local police in the coming days. Mayor Jorge Elorza announced late Tuesday afternoon that he has issued a citywide curfew beginning Tuesday night. Elorza said the curfew, which will be in place until June 9, will begin at 9 p.m. and end at 6 a.m. “This is not a decision that we take lightly and this is not a decision we make easily,” Elorza said. (Story continues below.) Both Warwick and Cranston have also issued citywide curfews beginning at 8 p.m. after reports of “planned violence” surfaced on social media. Central Falls and Pawtucket soon followed suit – issuing an 8:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, after hearing similar reports about their communities. East Providence also issued a citywide curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. In a statement, the Rhode Island ACLU said called the curfews “an extraordinary and overly broad action that, ironically, can only promote the types of discriminatory police actions that have prompted peaceful protests this past week.” It all started when hundreds of people gathered outside the mall to demand justice for George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died in police custody after an officer kneeled on his neck while he was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe. The incident was captured on video and has since sparked protests around the country. Rhode Island State Police Col. James Manni said he received a tip around dinner time Monday of a “planned disturbance,” calling it a coordinated attack by anarchists trying to come into the city and take it over. As a result of the tip, Elorza said the mall decided to close at 7 p.m. instead of 10 p.m. and city police were on alert. Elorza said even though police were in place ahead of time, the number of people was almost impossible to stop. By 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, throngs of people blocked off Francis Street, meeting a line of officers in the middle. Police continuously tried to clear the area but were met with resistance. (Story continues below.) The situation escalated when they stormed the mall with officers giving chase. People could be seen running toward storefronts on the first floor, looting and causing damage. Officers were seen working hastily to block off the entrances to the mall. Police said about 200 to 300 people were trying to get inside but only about 75 to 100 were successful. More than a dozen businesses inside the mall were looted and vandalized, according to police. The mall had just reopened to customers on Monday after it was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. NEW: Providence Place Mall will be closed through Friday, according to a spokesperson. Tentatively reopening Saturday. — Steph Machado (@StephMachado) June 2, 2020 Police said the looters were not inside the mall for long, since they were able to drive them out toward Cranston Street. In total, Elorza said 65 people were arrested, of which 35 were from Providence, five were from Massachusetts, and the rest were from other Rhode Island cities and towns. (Story continues below.) Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven Paré told Eyewitness News that nine police officers and troopers were injured after bricks were thrown at them. Four were from the Providence Police Department and five were from the Rhode Island State Police. Some of the officers were treated for minor injuries on scene while others declined treatment. Paré said police deployed “less than lethal tear gas” when a large number of people started throwing bricks and other objects at officers. (Story continues below.) Around 1 a.m., people began targeting police cruisers; they could be seen smashing the windshield and windows of one outside the mall before lighting it on fire. Officials said five cruisers were damaged in all, including the one that was set ablaze. The crowd eventually dispersed outside the mall, however, looting and vandalism continued elsewhere in the city. (Story continues below.)

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) WASHINGTON – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday urged President Donald Trump to be a “healer in chief” while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged “racism in America” as the wrenching debate fueling protests over the treatment of black people in the United States arrived in Congress. Pelosi invoked Biblical scripture to reject Trump's clampdown on peaceful protesters outside the White House and she drew on past presidents — including George H.W. Bush in the aftermath of the Rodney King unrest and Barack Obama following the death of Eric Garner — as models of the nation's chief executive at a time of crisis. “We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many presidents before him to be a healer in chief and not a fanner of the flame,” Pelosi said. As pleas for reconciliation over the country’s long struggle with racial inequality were met with demands for accountability over George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis, there was a shifting tone coming from Congress. Gone are the days when “Black Lives Matter” protests were met simply with “Blue Lives Matter” retorts in support of law enforcement. Instead, Congress seems to have heard the protesters outside its doors. “You can understand the outrage,” McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, said. McConnell said it's not only the death of Floyd at the hands of white police in Minnesota drawing protesters into the streets, but of other African Americans, including Breonna Taylor in his home-state of Kentucky. “There is no question that there is residual racism in America,” McConnell told reporters. “It’s been a longtime dilemma and we all wish we could get to a better place.” As the world watches a nation in turmoil, Democrats and some Republicans are swiftly preparing inquiries into the president's actions against the protesters and a legislative response to the police violence and racial inequality at the heart of marches erupting in communities nationwide. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., joined the protests. Trump was widely criticized for clearing protesters late Monday from outside the White House so he could walk across the street to hold up a Bible outside historic St. John's Church. It was viewed as a photo opportunity and criticized by the congregation's bishop. McConnell declined to directly comment on Trump’s handling of the crisis. However, several Republicans on Tuesday suggested it would be better if Trump helped calm the nation rather than escalate the already tense conditions in Washington and across the country. “I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,” said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, in a statement. “Every public servant in America should be lowering the temperature.” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called on Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to refuse the use of military helicopters and tear gas for “ugly stunts” like the one Monday. Senate Democrats proposed, and Republicans rejected, a resolution condemning the president's actions. McConnell offered instead a resolution condemning rioting and police violence against black Americans, which Schumer rebuffed as insufficient. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said he was “glad the president led” by clearing the protesters from the park. Cruz and other Republicans blamed outside agitators from the “antifa” anti-fascist movement for intervening in otherwise peaceful protests that resulted in looting and other property damage. Still, for a growing number of lawmakers there is an undeniable pattern of inequality in the treatment of black Americans by law enforcement, and they want to address it. Several Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, called Floyd’s death a “murder.” One, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said he understood there's a difference between his experience telling his sons to call the police if they need help and black families warning children to be cautious around law enforcement so as not to risk being harmed. “That’s a different kind of America and I think people are understanding those protests make sense,” Blunt said. More than 40 bills — from banning police choke holds and racial profiling to preventing the federal transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement to a long-sought federal anti-lynching law — are now under consideration on Capitol Hill. One House Democrat probed the Secret Service for any communication about Trump's ordering the clampdown on protesters outside the White House. Using words like “dictator,” “fascist” and other terms to describe Trump's actions, Democrats pleaded with Americans to stand with those working to improve police treatment of minority populations. “Racism is bad for everyone,” said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. She and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., among the nation's few black senators post-Reconstruction, spoke of their own childhoods growing up in civil rights era, a legacy of the nation's long path toward a more inclusive and representative government. With the Capitol still partly closed due to the coronavirus, a pandemic that is disproportionately striking black Americans, Congress is now confronting another deepening crisis. The Congressional Black Caucus announced a virtual town hall Friday with civil rights leaders, and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler is planning a hearing next week on policing. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said House lawmakers could be recalled to Washington this month to vote on legislation to address police and other reforms. Schumer urged McConnell to consider law enforcement reforms legislation by July 4. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report.",0.0

The tear gas was used on a group of protesters gathered near Richmond’s statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee during the fourth night of protests over the killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes as he pleaded for air.

Video posted to social media showed a line of police launching tear gas toward a group of protesters, who appeared to be yards away from the officers and peacefully gathered on the grass near the statue. Clouds of white gas surrounded demonstrators as they scattered, and one video appeared to show an officer chasing and spraying a protester. The department did not say how many officers were involved or what kind of discipline they face.

Police, medical workers, members of the press and those seeking medical assistance are excluded from the curfew. During a press conference Sunday morning, Stoney said he asked Northam to have the National Guard “be available if needed.” Northam said the National Guard is ready to step in if Richmond needs the assistance. “The Commonwealth has a compelling interest to maintain peace and order in the face of escalating tension,” Northam said.

Protesters responded to the curfew by gathering in Monroe Park and 17th Street Farmers Market in Shockoe Bottom on Sunday afternoon. Windows and storefronts on West Broad Street are boarded up to prevent vandalism. Protests and riots have broken out nationwide in response to George Floyd’s death, which was caught on video while Floyd was in police custody. In the video, a white officer can be seen holding his knee on Floyd’s neck while Floyd can be heard saying “I can’t breathe.” Protester Elizabeth Ratcliff said she believes business owners that saw damage or vandalism to their property during the protests should take advantage of their insurance. “Material possessions can be replaced but lives cannot,” Ratliff said. “We hope small businesses can reap some insurance benefits. Isn’t that what insurance is for?” Many businesses on West Broad Street suffered extensive damages during the protest on Saturday night. CVS, Whole Foods, Verizon and others had windows smashed, walls graffitied and merchandise looted. Protesters vandalized and climbed on statues honoring Confederate leaders Robert E. Lee, Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson and Jefferson Davis on Monument Avenue. The crowd held small demonstrations on the steps and around the statues. Balance Bicycle was broken into and looted on Saturday, according to a message posted on the business’s website. Bicycles that were in the shop for repair have been stolen.

Protesters walked down Monument Avenue, Cary Street and Broad Street for hours after a citywide curfew went into effect at 8 p.m., accompanied by drivers who blew their horns and played music through speakers. Organizers of the protest ended the route at the base of the Robert E. Lee statue and commended the crowd for staying peaceful on Monday. Then, encircled by idling cars and surrounded by hundreds of marchers, the group held a moment of silence for those who have been killed by police. The crowd dispersed around 12:30 a.m., ending the night early in comparison to the previous three days of protest in the city. Demonstrations over the weekend lasted into the early morning hours and left a trail of destruction in downtown Richmond. Richmond police officers who used tear gas Monday on protesters near the Robert E. Lee memorial 30 minutes before curfew were removed from the field, according to a tweet from Richmond Police. Chief Smith just reviewed video of gas being deployed by RPD officers near the Lee Monument and apologizes for this unwarranted action. These officers have been pulled from the field. They will be disciplined because their actions were outside dept protocols and directions given. — Richmond Police (@RichmondPolice) June 2, 2020 The tweet stated that officers will be disciplined because their actions were outside of department protocols and directions given. Richmond Police Chief Will Smith apologized for the “unwarranted” action. At least one protester occupying the Lee memorial attempted to pull the statue down with rope, when blue lights and sirens appeared. White protesters stood and knelt in front of the black protesters before police shot tear gas canisters, which caused the crowd to scatter. A group of about 400 protesters moved west on Monument Avenue and chanted “black lives matter,” and “no justice, no peace.” Monday was the fourth day of protests in Richmond in honor of George Floyd, a black man that died in police custody in Minneapolis. Nationwide protests have sparked in response to Floyd’s death, which was caught on video. Around 8 p.m., the Richmond Police tweeted an apology for gassing the Lee monument protesters, stating that officers in the area were “blocked off by violent protestors.” To our peaceful protestors: We are sorry we had to deploy gas near the Lee Monument. Some RPD officers in that area were cut off by violent protestors. The gas was necessary to get them to safety. — Richmond Police (@RichmondPolice) June 2, 2020 This message was refuted by multiple protesters. At least 10 people posted videos on Twitter depicting the gas being deployed on the crowd at approximately 7:30 p.m., thirty minutes before curfew. Virginia Public Media posted a video to their Twitter account showing police officers deploying tear gas on peaceful protestors. The video is timestamped 7:56 p.m., four minutes before the curfew imposed by Gov. Northam began.

They asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. The eyewitness said police used force near the Robert E. Lee memorial “with no warning.” “These police pulled up out of nowhere and surrounded the monument,” the eyewitness said. “There were tanks as well, there was a lot of police there and no one could move forward.” Gov. Ralph Northam issued a citywide curfew, which went into effect at 8 p.m. on Sunday, at Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney’s request. Protesters continued to march through the streets on Sunday night in downtown Richmond and near Monroe Park after curfew. Stoney will be holding a press conference tomorrow at noon at City Hall. He posted a message to his Twitter account, saying he would like to apologize to the protesters in person. To the peaceful protesters who were gassed tonight, please come.

Northam to discuss Virginia's future amid pandemic and protests,https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Gov-Northam-set-to-discuss-the-future-of-education-and-youth-sports-amid-pandemic-570942691.html,en,False,,80667,whsv.com,http://www.whsv.com/#spider,"Note: This article appears extremely long. That's because it includes previous updates from Gov. Northam's briefings throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest updates always come just below our introduction that overviews the current situation in Virginia. Headers indicate the date of each update, and you can search for updates from any past briefings by searching the date, like ""May 11."" Governor Ralph Northam addressed the commonwealth on Tuesday for his latest COVID-19 briefing as Virginians adapt to his latest executive order to require wearing face coverings inside businesses, which took effect on Friday, try to plan for the future as summer starts amid a pandemic, and react to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis with large-scale protests around the commonwealth, from a silent march of more than 1,000 in Harrisonburg to several nights of protests and violence in Richmond, with hundreds of arrests and protesters tear gassed by police. Last Thursday, in his press briefing at the time, the governor said he would be addressing at least two big questions on Tuesday: how youth sports can move forward safely and what recommendations his Education Work Group has developed on how children can safely return to the classroom in the fall. The earliest Virginia could enter Phase 2, Northam said on May 28, is Friday, June 5, and on Tuesday, after an hour dedicated to responding to protests and civil unrest following George Floyd's death, Northam said most of the commonwealth, except for Northern Virginia and Richmond, will enter Phase 2 on Friday. You can find detailed breakdowns of previous press conferences farther down on this page, under the headers for their respective dates. Most of Tuesday's press conference was not related to COVID-19 – that came in a short announcement after an hour involving leaders of color from around Virginia addressing Virginians about the current state of America. As of last Friday, when Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County joined the rest of the commonwealth after 2-week delays, all of Virginia is in Phase 1 of the governor's ’Forward Virginia’ plan. Northam has said his team will determine a date for Phase 2 based on how data trends on Virginia's COVID-19 tests, hospital bed capacity, and PPE supplies. As of Tuesday morning's latest COVID-19 numbers for Virginia, testing remains generally higher across Virginia and the 'percent positivity' rate of how many Virginians are testing positive for COVID-19 has been steadily decreasing over time. Northam has said that the restrictions established by his administration are ""the floor"" and that it's up to individual businesses whether they are able to safely reopen and individual regions can request changes if their data is different from the state's overall. As of June 2, Virginia has 41,401 total cases of COVID-19, including confirmed lab tests and clinical diagnoses, with 1,338 total deaths and 4,442 cumulative hospitalizations. According to the Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association, there are currently 1,502 Virginians hospitalized with either confirmed COVID-19 tests or pending COVID-19 test results and 5,472 patients who were hospitalized and have recovered. In general, over the past three weeks, test results have yielded lower daily case totals and increased testing, showing the ""curve"" of Virginia cases moving downward. But the commonwealth is still working to overcome an earlier backlog in testing and catch up to the national average of how much of the population has been tested, although state health officials say their focus is getting tests to the most vulnerable and most affected people. You can watch each of the governor's briefings through WHSV's livestream at whsv.com/livestream2 or on the WHSV News app. That livestream can also be watched through our Roku and Amazon Fire apps. You'll also be able to watch it live in the video player above during the briefing. The latest updates from Gov. Northam's June 2 briefing Addressing the death of George Floyd and protests across Virginia Governor Ralph Northam began Tuesday's briefing by acknowledging that he had ended Thursday's by saying he would have big announcements about Phase 2 on Tuesday, but that before any of that, there was something far more important to address. ""Our country is in a moment of turmoil and we have to talk about it,"" Northam said. The governor described all Virginians seeing the images of George Floyd ""begging for his life as a man in uniform took it from him,"" creating a new heartbreak for black Virginians and black Americans as the latest in a long list of names. Northam said the protests seen across America right now are for those names because of a system that allows it to continue to happen. ""What we're seeing today didn't spring out of thin air,"" Northam said. ""Racism and discrimination aren't locked in our past."" Quickly recapping 400 years of history from the arrival of enslaved Africans to Virginia through massive resistance to desegregation, and massive incarceration, Northam said oppression has always been there for black people in America. Citing maternal mortality rates, health inequities that made people of color more vulnerable to COVID-19, and more less visible forms on inequity, the governor said he can not know what it feels like to be a black person, but that he can stand with them. Northam went on to highlight actions taken by the General Assembly in recent years that he said will help address inequity across Virginia, including the expansion of Medicaid to expand access to health insurance for more communities, establishing new tools to help reduce maternal morbidity, reforming the criminal justice system by increasing the felony threshold for larceny and decriminalizing marijuana, as well as by making Election Day a holiday and ending the celebration of Lee-Jackson Day for Confederate generals in Virginia. Northam said there are four main steps his administration is taking: continuing listening and learning to black Virginians with virtual town halls; meeting with Virginia's Board of Chiefs of Police to discuss how they can respond; working to institute a statewide day of prayer, healing and action; and asking Virginia's African-American Advisory Board to continue their work examining the Virginia Code to find racist language from the past. The governor highlighted the work of the board to identify historic wrongs in the Commonwealth's past, which resulted in 14 bills signed by Gov. Northam to repeal racist laws still in the books. Each of those laws passed unanimously. ""These actions will not bring back lives lost,"" Northam said, but he said they are ""steps toward an America and a Virginia where this doesn't happen."" ""My message to protesters is that I hear you,"" Northam said, adding that he is ""here to work with you to build a place where no one fears for their life due to the color of their skin. . I pledge to stand with you. Addressing the situation from multiple perspectives Following the governor's comments on the protests around Virginia and the country, he invited a number of black lawmakers, pastors, members of the state's African-American Advisory board, a high school student, and Dr. Janice Underwood, Virginia's chief diversity officer, to speak on the situation. Speakers included Delegate Delores McQuinn, Wes Bellamy, Shirley Ginwright, Cynthia Hutsin, Northam's own pastor Rev. Kelvin Jones, Rev. Tyrone Nelson, and Niquel Perry, a rising senior from Albemarle High School. Del. McQuinn began by saying her heart was bruised and broken, but that it was sadly not the first time. She highlighted the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, but said they shine a light on a long history of violence in America that she says has been legalized, sanitized, and institutionalized over time. Delegate McQuinn thanked Gov. Northam, saying he was working to address inequity before the latest protests and that she was proud to support the General Assembly's move to repeal discriminatory language from the books, as well as to support the state's establishment of a commission to study study slavery, Jim Crow laws, massive resistance, and all of Virginia's history of oppression of blacks and what the impact of that has been. Like many of the speakers on Tuesday, she thanked Dr. Janice Underwood for taking on the role as the first diversity officer for any state in the country and thanked Northam for hiring her. Her overall message was that after people protest peacefully, she calls for everyone to sit at the table together to work on ways to continue addressing inequity. Following Delegate McQuinn, Rev. Kelvin Jones stepped to the podium, urging Virginians of all races to recognize that the pain of facing incidents like the death of George Floyd over and over again has worn people down and they feel their only response left is to fight. However, Jones said it's important not to get those people confused with others being opportunists and hiding behind the protesters authentically calling for justice. He said his message to looters is that they are not honoring the legacy of George Floyd, but what they're doing is wasting manpower that could be used to address systemic problems that instead has to dedicate resources to dealing with them. The answer the African-American community is looking for right now is just to be heard, Jones said. Minneapolis was heartbroken but intact after the death of Floyd, but it was after the people called for arrests and were not heard, after action was requested and did not come, that he said people turned to violent actions. And what he said happened is that the message sent by law enforcement and Minneapolis officials was that they won't respond to the concerns of people of color but will respond to violent actions. As many across the country have decided to peacefully protest, others have surrounded them ""saying no more,"" Jones said, and unfortunately, many people have been glad to focus on the negative actions of those instead of having a discussion about the reasons people are protesting. ""Wouldn't it be nice if we saw leaders say, 'we don't stand behind you. but we stand with you,'"" he said. Jones called for people to speak truth to power, not across the aisle, but in the aisle, and reminded Virginians that their response will be recorded in history, so they should ask what side of the page we'll be on. ""Will will be One Nation Under God,"" he said, ""or a house divided?"" Next, Shirley Ginwright, a Fairfax County leader who marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., addressed Virginia, calling for everyone to ""listen to the young people fighting for justice."" which she said is the position she was in while marching with Dr. King years ago. Yet people are still fighting for the same things now, she said, and asked everyone to stand up, calling for her white brothers and sisters to ""stand with us, not behind us."" Ginwright thanked Gov. Northam for several recent acts of legislation, including marijuana decriminalization, saying too many young people have been caught up in the criminal justice system due to it. She said there will be no going back to business as usual when the smoke has cleared, and that it will be up to people not to take action so that the next generation will not have to go through the same thing. Ginwright ended her message by saying that she hopes to see as many people marching now voting in the fall as well. Niquel Perry, a rising senior at Albemarle High School, came forward next to address all the children watching, calling on them to remember that they are the future and to use their right and vote. ""I have faith that this nation will become better,"" Perry said, calling for the protesters to remain safe. ""Black people are hurting,"" said Rev. Tyrone Nelson, reminding all Virginians that black people have been treated unequally for over 400 years and that when the George Floyd case is seen, what he sees is the case before that and the case before that. Rev. Nelson it makes him so sad that he has to through a lineage of what has happened to tell his children how to behave when interacting with police for their own safety. Next, Jim Bibbs called for police reform in Virginia, including mandatory bodycam and dashcam video operating at all times for law enforcement. Bibbs also called for people to challenge their behavior and stop being afraid to be the one in the room to challenge a behavior or statement that you feel is not right. If people don't do that, Bibbs said, the nation will never advance. ""We have to make the decision,"" Bibbs said, to challenge those moments and form a better community, a better Virginia, and a better nation for the future. ""It s exhausting to be black in America,"" said Cynthia Hutsin, saying she is committed to standing with Gov. Northam and to dismantling institutional racism in Virginia and in the country. She announced that they will share in the coming weeks how they believe Virginia can be more proactive to address inequity, because just like COVID-19, she said, systemic racism will require a team to address. Dr. Janice Underwood called for Virginians to listen to one another, – listen to your friend, listen to your coworker, listen to a relative who needs to share their pain. That, she said, is a way to be a genuine ally, but people need to lean into conversations on difficult topics and start by educating themselves about the racial dynamics of America's history, listening to each other, and also reading to learn more. Response to President Trump Governor Northam said he found President Trump's message to be one of divisiveness and not of healing and said that Virginia would not send its National Guard to Washington, D.C. in response to the president's order. Northam said that's because the mayor of D.C> did not request the support and because Virginia itself has plenty of reasons for the National Guard to remain. Finally, he said he would not deploy Virginia's men and women in uniform for a photo op for the president. Will Northam join the protesters? Gov. Northam said he is not the best one to talk about the pain protesters are feeling now, pointing people to the statements made by people of color on Tuesday, but that the bigger challenge for people who look like him is to ask themselves ""why,"" and sit down to discuss the reality and take actions to move forward. Northam said he acknowledges that there those out there exploiting the situation for violence and looting, and he regrets that and asks those individuals to ""take their energy elsewhere."" The governor said he will continue to reach out for dialogue, but that he doesn't think it would best for him to be in the protests ""for a number of reasons."" ""Let's not forget what we're seeing, why we're seeing it,"" and the Virginia way to listen to each other, Northam said. Republican response Following the governor's press conference, House Republican Leader C. Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah) and Senate Republican Leader Thomas K. Norment, Jr. (R-James City) issued the following statement: “Today, Governor Northam faced the people of Virginia for the first time since four days of protests, looting, and vandalism struck our cities. Hundreds of people were arrested after rioters did untold amounts of damage to homes, businesses, and public property. At the same time, otherwise peaceful protesters were tear-gassed for no reason. And the best our Governor could come up with was a half-hearted hope that people would stop being violent. “This Governor is so paralyzed by his own confusing past on racial issues that he is incapable of effective leadership at this critical moment. “Virginians need leadership. They need someone who will hear their voices and take action, someone who will simultaneously step up to ensure their homes and businesses are protected. Today, Governor Northam has shown himself unprepared and ill-equipped to do any of those things.” The next steps for the COVID-19 pandemic COVID-19 amid protests After a brief break between the portion of Tuesday's press conference addressing the civil unrest across Virginia and the nation in the wake of George Floyd's death, Governor Northam returned to discuss Virginia's next steps in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Northam reminded Virginians that we are still in this pandemic, and that it hasn't gone away even as our attention has been focused on protests, and he encouraged everyone who is protesting to wear masks and social distance if at all possible. With so many people gathering in spaces, and the virus spread through the air, Northam said everyone needs to remember that we're still in the middle of a pandemic. When asked for advice to anyone protesting on how to protect themselves after they return home, he reiterated general guidelines and encouraged anyone feeling symptoms to see their healthcare provider and seek treatment and testing. Phase 2 for Virginia After highlighting the continuing downward trend for percent positivity and hospitalizations across Virginia, alongside the upward trend for testing availability, Gov. Northam announced that most of Virginia will be able to move into Phase 2 as of this Friday, June 5. Northern Virginia and RIchmond, which each entered Phase 1 this past Friday after 2-week delays, will not be included in the move to Phase 2 on Friday. Northam said that's because the data on cases in those areas has not yet improved to the point to allow a move to Phase 2 in those areas. Accomack County, however, which entered Phase 1 at the same time, will join the rest of Virginia in Phase 2 on Friday. Northam said that's because their high numbers were due to specific outbreaks at poultry plants that now appear to be under control. Phase 2 will allow gatherings of up to 50 people instead of the current 10-person limit. It will also allow restaurants to open indoor seating back up, at 50% capacity, gyms and fitness centers to open for indoor classes at 30% capacity, pools to reopen for exercise and swim instruction, entertainment venues like museums and zoos to reopen with some restrictions, and recreational sports to start back up with distancing requirements and no shared equipment. The governor said more specifics would be outlined at his Thursday press conference, but that all details for Phase will be released Tuesday evening. He said the guidelines will still strongly encourage teleworking and physical distancing. Childcare Northam thanked childcare providers across Virginia for providing care for the children of essential workers and said the Department of Social Services will be sending guidance to childcare providers for moving forward. Health department and nursing home information Asked once again about the Virginia Department of Health's policy on not reporting the facilities with outbreaks, including nursing homes, unless facilities choose to identify themselves, health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver said they are not reconsidering their interpretation of Virginia's state code at this time. A response to Jerry Falwell, Jr. The final question Governor Northam was asked in his Tuesday briefing was how he would react to a tweet from Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr. that sparked controversy and led to backlash from university alumni, as well as the resignation of at least one professor. The tweet was one in which Falwell said he disagreed with Northam's mask order for Virginia but that if he had to wear a mask, he would wear one with the photo from Governor Northam's medical school yearbook page that featured someone in a KKK robe and someone in blackface. Northam, who was nearly forced to resign after initially saying he was in the photo and then denying it last year, did not address the question directly, but pointed to his background in neurology and child psychology. He said ""chapter 1"" of child psychology is to ""not water the weeds"" and to ""consider the source"" of the tweet. Next steps Gov. Northam said he will talk in more detail on Thursday about the exact guidelines for Phase 2, as well as guidance for the return of youth sports and in-person classes for the fall, which he had said last week would be addressed on Tuesday, but he determined addressing the situation facing the entire nation right now as a greater priority for Tuesday. The statewide situation in Virginia Most of Virginia officially entered Phase 1 of Gov. Northam's plan to gradually reopen the state on May 15 and all of Virginia joined Phase 1 by May 29, but the commonwealth remains under a series of public health orders and executive orders designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 — Because reopening means gradually lifting restrictions and not ""flipping a light switch,"" Governor Northam has said. Executive Order 53, which closed many non-essential businesses across Virginia and established Virginia's 10-person gathering limit, no longer applies in its original form, with businesses steadily re-opening, but the 10-person gathering limit is still in place and still enforceable for indoor gatherings like house parties. Executive Order 55, the 'Stay at Home' order first signed by Northam on March 30, is now a 'Safer at Home' order, encouraging all Virginians to continue staying home as the safest way to prevent COVID-19's spread and specifically telling Virginians vulnerable to the virus to stay home except for essential needs. On Friday, May 29, Executive Order 63 went into effect, making it mandatory for almost all Virginians to wear face coverings when entering businesses. You can learn how that will be enforced here. Virginia's state of emergency, which was originally set until June 10, was extended by Governor Northam on May 26 to run indefinitely. The Virginia Supreme Court's judicial emergency, which suspended all non-essential, non-emergency court hearings, expired on May 17 and court hearings across most of Virginia resumed on Monday, May 18. In light of that, with some eviction cases resuming, Gov. Northam's office released a list of resources to help people who may be facing eviction while still with income affected by COVID-19. DMV offices in Virginia began gradually reopening on Monday, May 18, and they have several customer service centers around the state open by appointment only for specific reasons. During the closure, Virginia State Police have not been enforcing inspections and extensions have been granted to people with expiring credentials for themselves or their vehicles, like licenses and registrations. Elective procedures and related offices, like dentists, were able to start again on May 1 after Gov. Northam lifted the public health order that initially closed them. Executive Order 53 is enforceable by law, unlike Executive Order 56 that's enforced by the health department, so someone who hosts a gathering of more than 10 people can be charged with a Class 1 misdemeanor. You can learn more about what police enforcement of Northam's executive orders looks like here. Virginia's primaries in June have been postponed by two weeks. Virginia officials are encouraging all voters to request absentee ballots. Statewide case totals and testing numbers as of June 2 By June 2, the Virginia Department of Health had received reports of 44,069 confirmed and 2,170 probable cases of COVID-19 across the commonwealth. ""Probable"" cases are cases that were diagnosed by a doctor based on symptoms and exposure without a test – also known as clinical diagnoses. Those positive test results are out of 369,308 total tests administered in Virginia, which included 328,889 PCR tests and 40,419 antibody tests (The Dept. of Health announced earlier this month that they would break testing data down by diagnostic and antibody tests.) Last week, from Tuesday to Wednesday, 9,795 new PCR tests and 88 new antibody tests were added to the state total. From Wednesday to Thursday, 10,199 new PCR tests and 1,248 new antibody tests were reported. From Thursday to Friday, 11,048 new PCR tests were reported, along with 1,682 antibody tests. This week, from Sunday to Monday, 9,285 new PCR tests were reported, as well as 542 antibody tests, and then from Monday to Tuesday, 6,321 new PCR tests and 453 new antibody tests were reported. As Virginia's community testing events offered by local health districts have increased, state health officials say the goal is to get tests to the areas in most need of them, with at-risk communities identified by the state health department (several of these events have been held in Harrisonburg and Rockingham County). Testing events sponsored by health districts are not turning anyone away. Overall, considering testing numbers and positive results, about 12.5% of Virginians who have been tested have received positive results. At the start of May, that percentage was standing steadily around 17%, but with increased testing, it's come down over time. However, some localities have much higher percentages, as outlined in our ""local cases"" section below. At this point, 4,770 Virginians have been hospitalized due to the disease caused by the virus, and at least 1,407 have died of causes related to the disease. The hospitalization and death numbers are totals confirmed by the Virginia Department of Health, which are always delayed by several days due to the logistics of medical facilities reporting information to local health districts, which then report it to the state health department. The hospitalization numbers are cumulative — they represent the total number of people hospitalized due to the disease throughout the pandemic and not the total number currently in the hospital. For current hospitalization stats, the VHHA offers more helpful data. The state website shows a lot of detail by locality, including hospitalizations and deaths for each city or county, and are broken down by zip code here, if you want to track cases on a neighborhood level. Where are our local cases? Overall, according to the Virginia Department of Health's June 2 breakdown, 369,308 tests have been run for the virus in Virginia, with 46,239 positive results. The department's breakdown and location map, available to the public here, shows the number of cases confirmed each day, number of people tested, total hospitalizations, total deaths, demographic breakdowns, and testing numbers, as well as breakdowns by health district. Here's a breakdown of cases for our region as of 9 a.m. on June 2. You can find the breakdown for the entire state in the chart at the bottom of this article. Numbers sometimes decrease day to day when the health department determines that a test initially reported in one locality was actually for a resident of another city, county, or state. Central Shenandoah • Augusta County - 115 • Buena Vista - 13 • Harrisonburg - 799 • Highland County - 3 • Lexington - 7 • Rockbridge County - 19 • Rockingham County - 545 • Staunton - 49 • Waynesboro - 47 Outbreaks: 15, with 6 in long-term care facilities, 1 in a healthcare setting, 6 in congregate settings, 1 in a correctional facility, and 1 in an educational setting | 486 cases associated with outbreaks Total tests: 9,561 Local percent positive: 16.7% Lord Fairfax • Clarke County - 28 • Frederick County - 371 • Page County - 230 • Shenandoah County - 465 • Warren County - 166 • Winchester - 196 Outbreaks: 18, with 8 in long-term care facilities, 3 in healthcare settings, 6 in congregate settings, and 1 in a correctional facility | 412 cases associated with outbreaks Total tests: 11,719 Local percent positive: 12.4% Thomas Jefferson • Albemarle County - 200 • Charlottesville - 128 • Fluvanna County - 92 • Greene County - 34 • Louisa County - 81 • Nelson County - 17 Outbreaks: 8, with 4 in long-term care facilities, 1 in a correctional facility, 2 in congregate settings, and 1 in an educational setting | 137 cases associated with outbreaks Total tests: 10,842 Local percent positive: 5.1% Rappahannock Rapidan • Culpeper County - 720 • Fauquier County - 326 • Madison County - 41 • Orange County - 110 • Rappahannock County - 14 Outbreaks: 7, with 2 in long-term care facilities, 1 in a healthcare setting, and 4 in congregate settings | 95 cases associated with outbreaks Total tests: 8,174 Local percent positive: 14.8% Local outbreaks As numbers have climbed in parts of the Shenandoah Valley, much of the increase has been attributable to outbreaks within particular facilities. By June 2, the Central Shenandoah Health District had identified 15 outbreaks and the Lord Fairfax Health District had 18. Health department officials have not specified the majority of the locations of our outbreaks, because the Virginia Department of Health has interpreted Virginia code as treating facilities the same as ""persons,"" meaning their anonymity has to be protected. So information about outbreaks is only released to the public if a facility grants permission for that to be released, and that has not been often. Of the outbreaks in our area, several have been confirmed at long-term care centers, including at Accordius Health Harrisonburg, where 22 patients died of COVID-19; here"" target=""_blank"">Skyview Springs, where there have been 16 confirmed deaths; Ritenour Rest Home in Staunton, where Augusta Health has confirmed a ""COVID situation"" but no exact numbers have been provided; and three outbreaks in Shenandoah County, including one at an unnamed nursing home and two at unnamed assisted living facilities. The largest of those outbreaks was the one at Accordius Health Harrisonburg, where 81 residents and 12 staff members tested positive for COVID-19 in April. By Tuesday, May 5, the facility confirmed 22 deaths due to coronavirus. By a little later in May, the large majority of patients had recovered from the virus. In Page County, the outbreak at Skyview Springs Rehab resulted in 59 residents and 23 staff members testing positive for the virus. By May 13, here"" target=""_blank"">16 people there had died of COVID-19-related causes. The facility has 115 residents total. Dr. Colin Greene, with the Lord Fairfax Health District, told WHSV earlier this month that the Skyview Springs outbreak was the only major outbreak in the Page County area. However, he said they were monitoring five active outbreaks in Shenandoah County. Due to Virginia code preventing the identification of facilities with outbreaks, he could not identify the exact locations, but said two were at businesses, two at assisted living facilities, and one at a nursing home. Outbreaks have also been confirmed at New Market Poultry, the Harrisonburg Men's Diversion Center, with at least 25 positive cases, and LSC Communications, which had at least six cases by the end of April but then stopped providing updates on their employee hotline so that media outlets would not have access to the information, which was not publicly provided. On May 26, RSW Regional Jail confirmed at least 15 people at the facility had tested positive for COVID-19, as the outbreak identified inside a correctional facility in the Lord Fairfax Health District. A day later, that number was up to 18 positive tests. Elsewhere, New Market Poultry Products, which has more than 100 employees working on a daily basis, confirmed near the end of April that they had multiple employees test positive – though an exact number was not provided and no update has come since then. None of the other Shenandoah Valley poultry plants have released any information about COVID-19 cases to the public, but 18 workers tested positive at the Pilgrim's Pride in Moorefield, W.Va. and Cargill in Dayton has confirmed the death of one employee due to COVID-19 – though never any information on the number of cases at the facility. Poultry plants and other meat processing facilities have been hotspots for the virus across the country and a focus of Gov. Northam's in Virginia. State health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver has also referenced the situation at poultry plants in Harrisonburg leading to a disproportionate number of cases among the Latino community in the Shenandoah Valley, though, again the facilities themselves have released no information publicly. The only exact number for poultry workers that has been provided is that as of May 20, at least 317 poultry plant workers living in the Central Shenandoah Health District had tested positive. Many of the local outbreaks that do not have confirmed locations have been identified in congregate settings, which could include workplaces, apartment complexes, churches, gyms, or any setting with a group of people in one place. While WHSV has received reports from viewers about specific stores, for instance, if the business does not provide consent for their information to be shared, the health department cannot confirm any information about cases there. Hospitalizations Of the state's 4,770 total hospitalizations, at least 123 have been in the Central Shenandoah Health District. Of those, 4 have been in Augusta County, 1 in Buena Vista, 57 in Harrisonburg, 1 in Rockbridge County, 53 in Rockingham County, 5 in Staunton, and 2 in Waynesboro. In the Lord Fairfax Health District, there have been at least 125 hospitalizations. Forty-five of those have been in Shenandoah County and 26 in Page County. Deaths As far as deaths, there have been 22 reported in Shenandoah County, 24 in Page County, two in Augusta County, 23 in Harrisonburg, and six in Rockingham County. Deaths, like all health department data, are reported by a person's listed residence. Dr. Norm Oliver, the state's health commissioner, has said that it often takes several days before local health districts are able to enter death information into the state database. Dr. Laura Kornegay, director of the Central Shenandoah Health District, told WHSV that deaths first have to be reported to them by medical facilities, which is a major cause for delays that have often been seen on the numbers reported for our area. Dr. Kornegay also explained that if someone has tested positive for COVID-19, that's what goes on their death certificate. Those death certificates have a space to list secondary causes of death, and that's where ongoing health issues like heart disease and cancer are listed. Some people have accused medical facilities of artificially inflating death tolls by doing that, but it's the same process by which flu deaths are reported every year. Recovery Wondering about the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19 in Virginia? Recovery information is not required to be sent to the Department of Health, so there is no accurate way to track that data for every single confirmed case. Individual health districts may track cases as ""active"" and ""non-active,"" but that data is not published anywhere in aggregate. But there is a way to track the number of patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 and have since been discharged – effectively tracking how many people have recovered from the most severe cases. The Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association updates their own dashboard of data each day on hospital-specific statistics, including bed availability, ventilator usage, and more. Their online dashboard indicates that, as of June 2, at least 6,011 COVID-19 patients have been discharged from the hospital. Unlike the VDH data that reports cumulative hospitalizations, their data on hospitalizations reflects people currently hospitalized for COVID-19 (whether with confirmed or pending cases), and that number is at 1,362. The data used by the VDH to report cumulative hospitalizations is based on information reported in hospital claims. On the other hand, the numbers reported by the Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association are based on a current census from hospitals, which provides a separate data set. Updates from Gov. Northam's May 28 briefing Governor Ralph Northam began Thursday's briefing by addressing the grim milestone marked on Wednesday, which was when the Johns Hopkins University tally of deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 surpassed 100,000. The governor said it;s important to remember that every statistic connected to the coronavirus isn't just a number but a person – someone with loved ones and friends. Northam said those numbers are why Virginians need to keep working to protect each other amid the pandemic. Anniversary of Virginia Beach shooting But this weekend also marks another tragic milestone, as Sunday will be one year since the Virginia Beach shooting in which 12 people lost their lives and four others' lives were forever altered by injuries. The governor said no in-person events will be held this year to remember the somber anniversary, but that grieving is not an event, but a process. A pandemic cannot stop the remembrance of the lives lost, he said, and he read aloud a list of the names of the victims one-by-one, followed by a moment of silence. Northam also thanked the Virginia Beach community for rallying to support each other after the deadly day, mentioning coworkers, first responders, friends, neighbors, and everyone who is a part of the Virginia Beach community. Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County As of Friday, May 29, Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County, which each had their entry into Phase 1 delayed by two weeks, will officially join the rest of Virginia in Phase 1, putting all of the commonwealth on the same guidelines. With major portions of the state population first entering the new phase, the governor reviewed the guidelines, which include restaurants open to outdoor seating at 50% capacity, salons and barber shops open with strict limits, and more. You can find the full list of guidelines in the ’Forward Virginia’ plan. Northam reiterated a statement he's made many times, which is that ""just because a business is allowed to open doesn't mean that it must open,"" if any business owners are not comfortable reopening yet. Face coverings and you With the new mask order beginning on Friday, Gov. Northam recapped that every Virginia, unless part of the limited exceptions list, should be prepared with a face covering. He said they don't need to be elaborate, again pointing to simple coverings like bandannas or online DIY instructions, and thanked the Virginians who have sent his office face coverings. The reason, he reminded everyone, is because as more has been learned about how COVID-19 spreads, the CDC says masks are a great help in limiting the virus' transmission, blocking droplets and aerosols from yourself that could infect others. Northam made the comparison that if you shouldn't go into a public place without shoes or a shirt, you shouldn't go in without a face covering. He also showed a new promotional graphic unveiled by the Virginia Department of Health encouraging customers to wear masks that is being sent to businesses across Virginia. But what about enforcement? One of the biggest questions that's been posed since Northam's announcement of the mask order earlier this week is how exactly it will be enforced. The governor had said on Tuesday that it would be the authority of the health department and not a matter for law enforcement, but the health department explained on Wednesday that they can use court orders against businesses that refuse to comply with a Class One misdemeanor. Rita Davis, counsel to the governor, came to the podium on Thursday, to explain that in more detail. Davis said the enforcement is a statutory process by which all public health orders are enforced and that it's been the standard included in all five public health orders issued so far in the pandemic. It was not created specifically for the mask order and is not new, she emphasized. As the standard enforcement mechanism established under Virginia's health code, she said it provides two ways for the health commissioner to enforce the order: by a civil order to obtain an injunction against a non-compliant business or by a warrant through a magistrate for a misdemeanor charge. Davis said those are the procedures made available for any enforcement, but they're reserved only for ""gross and repeated"" violations. She said the state government is not expecting business owners to enforce the order, but instead encourages them to educate their patrons about the importance of wearing a mask. While not the responsibility of the business owner, she said it shouldn't be the responsibility of the health department or law enforcement either to make sure you're wearing a face covering, but the personal responsibility of each Virginian as the right thing to do to protect their families and fellows Virginians. So can a business refuse service to someone who refuses to wear a mask? Davis encouraged business owners to use the opportunity to have a discussion with any non-compliant individual, but said business do have the right to ask a patron to return at a different time ""when they're more convinced they should be wearing a mask."" Asked by a reporter for more information later, Gov. Northam said the intent of the mask order is to ""do the right thing"" and take care of people around you, not to lock anyone up in jail. He said, as a business owner, he would nicely ask someone who's not wearing a mask if they would mind wearing one for the safety of the people in his office. While not wanting businesses to be in the practice of enforcing the order to avoid causing any confrontations, he asked people to just think of others and wear a mask for their benefit. Asked for more clarity about what the health department will do, Counsel Davis said if a person repeatedly refuses to wear a mask, rather than a business enforcing it themselves, they would report the incident to the Virginia Department of Health, which could take action as needed. The only situation in which she foresees law enforcement involvement is if a confrontation evolves between a patron refusing to wearing a mask and an employee, but at that point, law enforcement is not there because of someone not wearing a mask, but because of a confrontation between a patron and an employee. Okay, but what about people who say they meet one of the exceptions to the mask requirement listed in the executive order? Governor Northam said that business will have to rely on a person's word if they say they meet an exception. Again using his medical office as an example, he said if someone explained that they had COPD and so couldn't wear a cloth mask, he would accept that explanation and encourage them to continue social distancing. Phase 1 for at least another week Governor Northam announced on Thursday that all of Virginia will remain Phase 1 for another week at a minimum, with June 5 the earliest that the commonwealth can enter Phase 2. While all of the trends for COVID-19 are heading down in the state, especially percent positivity, and testing capacity and PPE supplies are increasing, he said it's simply too soon to determine when Virginia can begin Phase 2 because of the incubation period of the virus. It can take up to two weeks for someone with infected with COVID-19 to begin showing symptoms, so Northam said there's no feasible way to move into Phase 2 yet while relying on the data, but that his administration will continue to monitor moving forward. CVS offering testing Northam also announced on Thursday that 39 CVS pharmacies across Virginia will start offering testing using self-swab kits while staff members monitor the use of the test. However, the closest location to the Shenandoah Valley offering it will be in Charlottesville. Northam's testing The governor said he intends to get tested for the virus soon. He said on Tuesday that he hoped to get tested at one of the health department's community testing events, but he has not provided any specifics on that yet. Virginia's beaches After Virginia Beach reopen to recreational use last weekend, Governor Northam says his visit to the beach was to check how their comprehensive plan was working. Saying that it worked, Virginia's other public beaches will be able to reopen to recreational activity this Friday, with restrictions in place similar to Virginia Beach's plan, including no group sports, no tents, no alcohol allowed, and more. ""People can be safe while enjoying our beautiful beaches,"" Northam said. Racing is back The governor also announced on Thursday that Virginia is allowing NASCAR and horse races to resume single-day events on Friday. Any races held in Virginia will not be open to the public and no spectators will be allowed, but because the competitors are in open air events with spacing between the participants, Northam said his administration determined there's minimum risk of spread as long as fans are not present. He pointed to that move as a step to help Virginia's economic recovery as well. More business news Gov. Northam highlighted this week's announcement that Microsoft is launching a new technology hub in northern Virginia, which he said should bring 1,500 new jobs to the commonwealth. Saying that Virginia is glad to have all those jobs, Northam said people should expect more big job announcements in the next few days pertaining to rural areas of Virginia. In addition, he pointed out that the first wind turbine foundation in federal waters has been erected off of Virginia Beach, describing that as another source of new jobs in the renewable energy sector. New extension for expiring licenses Although regional Virginia DMV offices have been gradually reopen by appointment for certain critical in-person services, the governor acknowledged that many people have had difficulties taking care of tasks with the DMV, including license and ID renewals. Because of that, Northam said the DMV is extending the deadline for license renewals. According to the DMV, all driver's licenses and identification cards expiring on or before July 31, 2020, are extended for 90 days, to August 31 at the latest. That means any customer whose credential expired between March 15 and May 31 gets 90 days from the expiration date to renew, and credentials expiring from June 1 to July 31 have until August 31 to get renewed. Vehicle registrations that expire in March, April, and May are also extended for 90 days. Those expiring in June are extended for 60 days and those expiring in July are extended for 30 days. National Guard funding Amid other announcements, Northam mentioned the federal government's approval of Virginia's request for an extension of Title 32 status for the Virginia National Guard, which will allow for the federal government to continue providing payment to help provide for National Guard troops assisting in Virginia's pandemic response, which the National Guard has been a critical part of, especially for community testing events. Graduations Gov. Northam addressed any high school and college seniors, saying they've worked for years and unfortunately won't get the in-person celebrations they expected but deserve to be honored for their hard work. He congratulated every graduate in Virginia and said he looks forward to them doing great things. On Friday evening at 5 p.m., he and his wife will be the hosts of ""Virginia Graduates Together,"" a live commencement ceremony for Virginia graduates airing on public television stations across the commonwealth, as well as on Facebook Live and YouTube. You can learn more about that event, which will feature a lot of celebrities from Virginia, here. Is a mask order health vs. wealth? Many questions posed by reporters on Thursday focused on how the new mask order will be enforced and its implications for business owners and employees across Virginia. Asked if he's forcing businesses to ""choose between health and wealth,"" Northam came back to a familiar statement he's made at many briefings, which is that Virginia is in the middle of both a health crisis and an economic crisis and will have to get through the health crisis first to get the economy recovering to the strong point it was at before the pandemic. The governor said his message to consumers and to businesses, as a business owner himself, is that the recovery is consumer-driven and that the focus should be on the health and safety of consumers, who may not feel comfortable going into businesses that they don't feel are working to protect their health. Northam said both health and wealth can be present at the same time as long as Virginians remember that ""we're all in this together"" and work for each other's safety. ""We are where we are today because of Virginians and I say thank you,"" Northam said, but continued that the only way to get through both the health and economic crises is to ""put the politics aside and be a part of the solution."" How Virginia will respond to any future spikes New modeling from the University of Virginia predicts large spikes of new cases in Virginia if the commonwealth continues on the 'Forward Virginia' plan for reopening. Gov. Northam said while he hasn't reviewed the newest UVA model yet, it's one his team reviews, but that modeling is only part of the picture. Ultimately, he said they're working with the data available on each day and taking steps for reopening on a day-by-day basis. If the data shows any new hot spots for the virus emerging this summer, with numbers not going in the right direction, Northam said adjustments will be made as needed. He pointed to the restrictions of Phase 1 and the delay for areas with worst data as a way they're working to prevent surges. What about the possibility of more cases in areas just now moving to Phase 1? The governor said the reason Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County will enter Phase 1 on Friday is because his team and their local goverments determined the data allows for it, based on a decrease of case activity in those areas, a decrease in hospital beds filled by COVID-19 patients, an increased ability to test and a lot more testing, and more PPE available. Northam thanked the leaders in each of the areas, but said, regardless, they will be monitoring the latest data each day to catch any potential spikes once the areas move to Phase 1. What about the timeline for those areas and Phase 2? When Phase 1 was announced for most of Virginia, Gov. Northam said it had a two-week minimum time period. However, with Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County starting Phase 1 on May 29 and the earliest start of Phase 2 on June 5, that only allows for one week. Asked if he would mandate those areas to spend two weeks in Phase 1 like the rest of Virginia, Northam said that discussion will be had with individual leaders for the areas, but if they're comfortable, he'd like to see all of Virginia move to Phase 2 at the same time. However, he said her remains open to discussions with any other areas that may not feel comfortable going forward into Phase 2. Will any move be made to stop evictions? With evictions able to continue now that Virginia's judicial emergency expired, Governor Northam said he still points anyone facing potential eviction to the resources his office has shared before and encourages landlords and tenants to work together to find ways to avoid evictions. He's not planning to take any specific action on the topic, but said he would look into if federal funds provided to local governments through the CARES Act can be used to help people catch up on rent. Why have deaths increased so much in Virginia over the past few days? The latest health department data reported this week has shown substantial increases in deaths reported due to COVID-19. But Dr. Forlano, the deputy health commissioner, said that's not necessarily tied to Phase 1 or to any one specific thing, because death data is a lagging indicator – meaning it's always at least several days behind. That's because the Virginia Department of Health has to wait for death certificates to validate any information about deaths connected to COVID-19. Why is the State of Emergency extended indefinitely? On Tuesday, the governor extended Virginia's state of emergency without an end date. He said that's because it allows Virginia to continue working with Medicaid to compensate telehealth and it allows continued use of the National Guard for assistance with testing, among other reasons. Announcements to come on Tuesday Governor Northam said he'll be addressing two questions he's heard a lot at his next briefing on Tuesday. The first is in regards to youth sports. He said he wants to encourage families and kids to be active this summer, but wants to make sure that's done safely, so on Tuesday, he'll be announcing new guidelines under which youth sports can be conducted. The second is about children returning to school. Northam said the Education Work Group has had a lot of great discussion on how children can return safely in the fall, and he'll have more announcements on that on Tuesday. For now, he said know that they're doing everything they can to make sure children can get back into classrooms safely. Closing notes from the governor Governor Northam encouraged Virginians to remember the more than 1,000 people around the commonwealth who have lost their lives due to COVID-19, as well as those who were killed in Virginia Beach a year ago. He also called for people to ""get the politics out of this"" and wear masks to protect each other so that Virginia can get the health crisis in the past and move on to getting the economic crisis taken care of too. Previous updates from Gov. Northam's May 26 briefing Addressing criticism for his mask-less Virginia Beach visit Governor Ralph Northam started Tuesday's briefing by directly addressing the criticism he received after photos showed him not wearing a mask during a visit to Virginia Beach over the weekend. Northam emphasized that Virginia Beach was only allowed to open after the city's reopening plan was approved by the state government to keep visitors as safe as possible amid the pandemic. He said he was at Virginia Beach to thank the mayor and city leaders for their work on that effort, thank first responders in the city, and thank ambasadors in the area, all while in open air along the beach with social distancing in each meeting. According to the governor, he was not planning to interact with members of the public while he was there. His account of the situation when pictures were taken is that he was headed down the Virginia Beach boardwalk to talk to members of the press when who he described as ""well-wishers"" approached him and wanted to take a photo. Northam claimed he was not prepared for that, and had left his mask in his car, but wanted to accommodate the people's request for a photo because he tries to not turn down to requests for photos. He thanked the people who he said held him accountable for his action of not wearing a mask and said he takes full full responsibility for not being prepared, and will work to be better prepared whenever he is out in the public again. Saying that he, like everyone, is forming new habits and routines to adjust to the new normal of COVID-19, he emphasized that it was his responsibility. Virginia Beach's reopening Following up his apology and explanation, the governor said Virginia Beach did well with reopening over the weekend, without large gatherings and with people social distancing and following the rules on the beach. Northam said he hopes Virginia Beach can be a model for other beaches across the country planning to reopen safely. Plans for other beaches Specifically, Northam said Virginia Beach's plan will be a benchmark for the state to consider proposed plans from Norfolk, Hampton, and other beaches along Virginia's coast that hope to open up this coming weekend. The governor said if their plans work like Virginia Beach's, those plans will be approved in the coming days. The latest data trends Gov. Northam very briefly recapped the latest case trends in Virginia, pointing to overall declines in percent positivity and hospitalizations across the commonwealth, alongside testing capacity trending upward and steady PPE supply numbers. He said that data supports assessments made by his state's team and by health district directors across Virginia, including in Northern Virginia. The future for areas still in Phase 0 Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County all remain in Phase 0 of Virginia's reopening plan, not yet in Phase 1, which the rest of Virginia entered on May 15. Local government leaders in Northern Virginia sent a formal letter to state health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver on Sunday, writing that the area has met most of the necessary data metrics to move into Phase 1, including two weeks of downward trends in cases. Accomack County leaders also indicated a readiness to move forward. In Richmond, Mayor Levar Stoney followed a different path, asking for the city to move into a modified Phase 1 that remains more restrictive. Northam said more information will be released by his office on Wednesday, while they remain in communication with Richmond's mayor, on guidelines for when each area will be able to move forward. However, he did confirm that the plan is for the areas to move into Phase 1 on Friday. For Richmond specifically, he said he received Mayor Stoney's letter Tuesday morning and is in discussion with the mayor and Richmond officials to figure out all the moving parts with their specific request. What about Phase 2 for the rest of Virginia? Gov. Northam, asked when he'll be able to say when most of Virginia can enter Phase 2, did not provide any specifics. He said the incubation period COVID-19 is around two weeks, which makes moving forward two weeks after the start of Phase 1 difficult, since the data won't be there yet for many cases contracted since Phase 1 began. Northam said his team will determine a data for Phase 2 as soon as they can, but Phase 1 will continue through at least this Friday. Essentially, he said the health department doesn't have the data yet to make a safe decision on Phase 2 timing, although the two-week minimum was a time period he initially announced. As Phase 1 continues, Northam reminded Virginians that it loosens restrictions but does not require business to reopen. Saying that ""just because you can open doesn't mean you have to open,"" he encouraged business owners to do what they feel is right for their workers and customers and encouraged local governments to communicate with business owners about the guidelines for safe operation. A mask order While Virginia remains in Phase 1, Gov. Northam said one major change will come this Friday. Effective Friday, May 29, Northam announced that people will need to wear face coverings inside public places of businesses. That order is taking effect through Executive Order 63. The new mask order applies to everyone 10 and over and requires wearing a face covering while "" entering, exiting, traveling through, and spending time in"" the following establishments: • All essential and non-essential brick and mortar retail establishments, including grocery stores and pharmacies • All personal care and grooming establishments • Inside food and beverage establishments (The text of the executive order specifies ""restaurants, dining establishments, food courts, breweries, microbreweries, distilleries, wineries, tasting rooms, and farmers markets, when permitted to reopen for indoor dining"") • On public transportation, including train stations, bus stations, and on intrastate public transportation, including in waiting or congregating areas • Entertainment or public amusement establishments when they're allowed to open in a later phase • State and local government buildings and areas where the public accesses government services • Inside any indoor space shared by groups of people who may congregate within six feet of one another or who are in close proximity to each other for more than ten minutes Exceptions are provided for the following situations: • Exercising • While eating or drinking • If you have trouble breathing or are unable to remove a mask without help • If health conditions prohibit wearing a face covering • Young children The governor strongly encouraged any child 3 years old and older wear a face covering if possible, but it's only required for children over the age of 10. Northam's office also issued a reminder that face coverings do not take the place of public health guidelines to maintain six feet of physical distancing, increase cleaning and sanitation, and wash hands regularly. Why? Gov. Northam said the reason for the face covering order is because protecting the people around us means face coverings. As research has continued into COVID-19, more and more health professionals have agreed that face coverings are critical to continuing daily operations around the country. ""I wear a mask to protect you, you wear a mask to protect me,"" said Dr. Norm Oliver, encapsulating the basic logic behind wearing face coverings, which help prevent droplets from yourself that could potentially infect others if you don't know you're symptomatic. What constitutes a face covering? Under Executive Order 63, a face covering includes anything that covers your nose and mouth, such as a mask, scarf, or bandana. Medical-grade masks and personal protective equipment should be reserved for health care professionals, Northam said. Getting a mask The governor said face coverings do not need to be medical grade and highly recommended many websites that have instructions on how to create your own face masks with materials at home, as well options like bandannas. He also encouraged any groups that can help provide face coverings to people who don't have them to please do that. How will the order be enforced? Governor Northam said the mask order is a ""matter of public health"" and not a criminal matter, so any enforcement of the new mask order will be done by health officials rather than law enforcement officials. The governor said his goal is to protect people's health and not to get people in trouble for not wearing masks, saying he's simply asking people to respect one another. However, pressed by reporters about how the order can be enforced, he said his office looked into the possibility of criminal enforcement and determined that violations could only be charged as a class 1 misdemeanor, which can come with large fines or even jail time, and he said that's not what he wanted. The governor's office is expecting the General Assembly to discuss the possibility of a civil fine for violations when they re-convene for a special session at some point in the next two months, but nothing is happening on that front at this point. So what does enforcement through the health department actually look like? The governor was very light on details when asked about that. Essentially, he said people would need to contact the Virginia Department of Health about any businesses that are not complying with the order. He said the legality of enforcement ""can get complicated in a hurry"" but simply said it will be enforced by the Virginia Department of Health. Clark Mercer, Northam's chief of staff, went into a little more detail, though. He said health officials would simply issue warnings to individuals not wearing masks, but their focus will be on businesses that are ""grossly negligent"" in enforcing the mask order. In the case of a business not following the mask order, the Virginia Department of Health and the Department of Labor and Industry can be contacted and can each take action against businesses, pulling the operating license of businesses that repeatedly refuse to comply with mask order. On Wednesday, WHSV reached out to the Virginia Department of Health, who issued this statement about how they can enforce the order: VDH has the power to enforce egregious patron/customer violations through a court order, which is punishable by a Class One misdemeanor. Many businesses also have face covering requirements for their employees as outlined in Phase One restrictions (restaurants, salons, etc.), which are enforced by the health department and the relevant regulatory agency. We are not looking to put anyone in jail—we are focused on education, and we hope and expect that Virginians will do the right thing. When can the mask order be lifted? Asked when the mask order will be able to be lifted, Northam said the problem with any timelines looking into the future is that COVID-19 is a novel virus, with more constantly being learned and the situation constantly developing. He said the order will be lifted as soon as it's safe to do so, but the focus is largely on protecting workers, and there is no exact timeline. Will face coverings be required in schools? Governor Northam has said repeatedly in briefings that he hopes to have schools reopen in the fall. Asked if the state may require face coverings for students when schools do reopen, the governor said his team is considering the possibility, but will have to see what the virus does in the coming months before fall comes. A decision will be made on potential face covering requirements by fall. Protecting workers Gov. Northam said the face covering order is especially designed to protect workers who are put in vulnerable populations by interacting with customers who come into businesses not wearing masks as more businesses reopen and more people venture out. Republican response House Republican Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, House Republican Caucus Chair Kathy Byron, R-Bedford, and House Republican Whip Jay Leftwich, R-Chesapeake issued the following statement in response to the governor's order: “We are deeply concerned about Governor Northam’s actions today. It is unconscionable to require businesses to enforce a government mandate under threat of sanction from government agencies. This puts yet another burden on businesses already reeling from months of being shut down or severely limited."" “Throughout this episode, the Governor has acted inconsistently. Through his own actions the Governor has squandered his capital as a physician whose advice people would be willing to follow. Virginians would be much more likely to follow the suggestions of a leader who instills confidence and leads with consistency.” New workplace regulations With worker safety in mind, Gov. Northam said Virginia's Department of Labor and Industry is working to draft new regulations on workplace safety standards amid the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring employers to have set guidelines for controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19 through specific measures for their workplace, including how to enforce social distancing and providing PPE for workers. These occupational safety standards will require the approval by vote of the Virginia Safety and Health Codes Board and must address personal protective equipment, sanitation, record-keeping of incidents, and hazard communication. Upon approval, the Department of Labor and Industry will be able to enforce the standards through civil penalties and business closures. Northam's optimism Governor Northam said he's optimistic for the future with the mask order in place, because he said he's seen Virginians doing the right things to control the virus' spread. But he asked Virginians to all remember the golden rule and keep looking out for each other. ""The future will not look like the past,"" he said, at least for a while, but he said Virginians have stepped up in the best ways. PPE and contact tracing Governor Northam said it's essential that all of Virginia has access to the necessary personal protective equipment and that the Virginia Department of Emergency Management has been working with agencies to provide all materials necessary to health care workers and first responders. He acknowledged that there's always more work to done, and also highlighted the continuing work of the Virginia Department of Health to hire 1,200 contact tracers, saying they may starting more if needed, but the process is moving forward. Monday's data surge Health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver was asked about the large number of cases and tests reported on Monday, which the health department announced later in the day was due to maintenance on their technical system that had prevented the release of most numbers on Sunday. Dr. Oliver told a reporter that he didn't see it as a discrepancy in the data, but just an update with two days worth of data. He said their servers were improved with new memory and storage, but while the servers were down for that upgrade, no new reports from local health districts could be processed into the dashboard. Is the governor getting tested? Gov. Northam said he has not been tested for COVID-19 yet in the pandemic, but that he looks forward to going to a community testing site in the near future to demonstrate how easy the test is and encourage more Virginians to get tested. Reporting recovery data? Asked once again about the possibility of reporting recovery information about Virginia's COVID-19 cases, health officials pointed Virginians to the VHHA website, which tracks the latest number of hospitalized patients who have since been discharged. A lack of demographic data A number of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Virginia still do not have demographic data available to the public. Health commissioner Dr. Oliver said that is tied to the clinician who places any particular COVID-19 test, because the health department gets their data from the labs. Dr. Oliver said they've worked to educate clinicians around Virginia on encouraging including race and ethnicity data when making lab orders for tests, and said they've seen great improvement, especially after the state was initially missing the data on more than half of cases early in Virginia's response. He also pointed to the Health Equity Work Group, which is looking at ways to look at the data and understand exactly how communities of color have been impacted. Protections for workers For employees who have returned to work or who are returning to work but don't feel comfortable in their workplace, Megan Healy, Gov. Ralph Northam’s chief workforce development adviser, said the current practice for Virginia is for the employee to try working directly with their employer to improve conditions. If that does not work, employees are encouraged to file a complaint with OSHA, which then passes the complaint on to Virginia DOLI. DOLI is also the department that Northam announced on Tuesday is implementing emergency temporary standards for all Virginia workplaces. However, Healy said those standards will have to be approved by health code boards, which she said should meet ""soon"" to consider codifying the new standards. Help for areas with higher death rates Dr. Laurie Forlano said Virginia's Health Equity Work Group is using software to track the communities at highest risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths based on the prevalence of chronic conditions, employment rates, poverty, and other factors, using that information to target prevention efforts at the communities in most need. She also said the data surveillance team for the state will look into the possibility of expanding data on deaths to indicate how many head underlying conditions. Moving forward Governor Northam said his focus is on the health and well-being of Virginians, especially the health and well-being of workers. With the mask order going into effect Friday, he encouraged Virginians to use the next few days to get ready. He also emphasized in his closing remarks that the move is not to punish people but to promote safety because ""we're all in this together."" The governor encouraged everyone to cooperate and ""be a part of the solution"" so that Virginia can get the health crisis in the rearview mirror and begin returning to normal. Previous updates from Gov. Northam's May 22 briefing The latest Virginia data and prevention As has been the norm for Governor Northam's COVID-19 briefings, he began Friday's by reviewing the latest data on Virginia's cases and testing, which has shown the number of tests trending upward the percent of positive tests trending downward. However, as positive test percentages continue to trend down, the governor says it's just as important, if not more important, to continue following the basic guidelines on how to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including social distancing of at least 6 feet, hand-washing, and wearing a face covering in public. A mandatory face mask order? Gov. Northam emphasized that wearing a face covering could potentially save someone else's life, since they are worn to protect others from yourself, with many people carrying the virus without symptoms. The governor said face coverings are an important part of Virginia's next steps and that he'll have more to say on that next week, when the next state briefing happens on Tuesday. While not outright saying that he'll be issuing a mask order, he very strongly suggested it. Later in the briefing, the governor was asked about Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney's request for a mask order for the capital city. Northam said he has been in communication with Richmond officials about it, but has also been discussing plans for a policy with his COVID-19 task force and working through the details. He said one of their focuses is on equity: being able to make sure everyone has access to a mask, and pointed to many ways people can wear face coverings without purchasing a specific surgical mask, like using bandannas, or following online instructions for DIY masks without needing to sew. Another focus, he said, has been how his administration could enforce such an order. Masks are intended to protect other people, Northam reminded Virginians, and said that's the main goal for COVID-19 response. He clarified that his announcement on Tuesday will be for all of Virginia and will especially apply to places of business. What about Phase 2 and the plan for areas still in Phase 0? The governor said he knows everyone is wondering when Virginia will enter Phase 2 and when northern Virginia, Accomack County, and Richmond will be able to enter Phase 1 with the rest of the state. He said his team is in constant communication with the localities that are still in Phase 0 at their requests, and he'll have more on the timeline for the next phase for those areas and the rest of the state next week as well. A new assessment tool Governor Northam announced that the Virginia Department of Health is launching a new tool to let people check their symptoms and find the closest testing site to their location. It's called ""COVID Check,"" a telehealth and online risk assessment tool that you can find: HERE. Northam said it will ask you for your symptoms, and, based on your responses, give recommendations on what you should do next, including options on where you can go to get testing. A statewide testing effort Northam highlighted the Virginia Department of Health's community testing events across the commonwealth, which included more than 4,300 tests given this week. He thanked the Virginia National Guard, which has conducted over 10,000 tests so far, and showed a slide featuring multiple community testing events organized by the health department for the coming week, including one in Rockingham County. After thanking the National Guard for their testing assistance, Northam also thanked them for their work rescuing people from severe flooding in southwest Virginia over the past few days. The pilot program for online SNAP ordering The governor also announced the pilot project approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week to allow Virginia families who receive SNAP benefits to order groceries online through select retailers and have them delivered. Right now, the plan includes Walmart and Amazon, but more retailers are expected to be added in the coming weeks. It will launch on May 29, Northam said, and will allow families with low incomes to get access to nutritious food without having to leave their homes and will help keep people with underlying conditions from having to go out. He thanked Virginia's senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, for pushing to make the pilot program possible. Unemployment in Virginia Virginia had 44,000 new claims for unemployment insurance over the past week, bringing the state's current unemployment rate up to 10.6%. Gov. Northam pointed to the state's 2.8% rate before the pandemic as a sign of how strong Virginia was doing on the business front before COVID-19, but said his administration is working to help those left unemployed as much as possible. Thousands of Virginians have reported problems with the Virginia Employment Commission system, left unable to access a real person for help with questions and left without receiving benefits, though. To help respond to that, Northam said on Friday that he knows many people have had difficulties, and the Virginia Employment Commission (VEC) is opening up a new call center with 315 additional employees to help handle the influx of calls. A plan for graduates With high schoolers and college students across Virginia not able to have their traditional graduation ceremonies this year, Gov. Northam announced that Virginia Public Media will be airing a celebration of all Virginia graduates called ""Virginia Graduates Together"" next Friday, May 29, at 5 p.m. Across the state, all public TV channels will air the ceremony, which will feature special guests to honor 2020 graduates. He encouraged graduating seniors to submit photos, videos, and special messages for the ceremony to Virginia Public Media at vpm.org/grad. Eid This weekend marks Eid al-Fitr, holy days for Muslims, and Gov. Northam wished all Muslims in Virginia a blessed and joyous celebration, but encouraged safe celebrations amid the pandemic. Memorial Day With this coming Monday marking Memorial Day, Gov. Northam said he's asking all Virginians to remember this weekend what the day is for and to recognize all members of the U.S. military who have given it all and made the ultimate sacrifice. He encouraged reflections on their sacrifices and said the Virginia War Memorial's annual event will be a virtual one this Monday. Virginia state flags will be flying at half-staff to honor all the sacrifices of the military on Monday, and at half-staff to honor COVID-19 victims over the weekend, just like President Trump's order for U.S. flags on federal buildings. While people mark the holiday weekend, Northam encouraged all Virginians to maintain social distancing, avoid large gatherings, and wear face coverings. The unemployment work search requirement Throughout this pandemic, the Virginia Employment Commission has not been enforcing their normal work search requirement for people to receive unemployment insurance. Megan Healy, Gov. Ralph Northam’s chief workforce development adviser, explained that that requirement will not be re-instituted until the Virginia Employment Commission's 61 work search centers are reopen. At this point, they all remain closed and employees are working remotely. Unemployment trust fund running empty Healy said reports that Virginia's trust fund for unemployment insurance is running out of money are correct. While the additional $600 a week for unemployment and the PUA program are paid for directly by the federal government, she said the large influx of unemployment claims across Virginia, like around the nation, have drained the state's unemployment insurance fund, which is normally paid for through state taxes. The state is asking the federal government for assistance. President Trump's order for places of worship Minutes before Gov. Northam took the podium for his briefing, President Donald Trump announced that he was deeming houses of worship essential services and called on governors to allow them to reopen this weekend. Asked for his response, Governor Northam said he wants to be sure people can practice their faith safely, and that's why his administration moved houses of worship to the same guidelines as retail in Phase 1 of the 'Forward Virginia' plan. Both places of worship and retail stores are allowed to operate at 50% capacity with social distancing measures and increased sanitation in place. However, he said he's not requiring houses of worship to open up to in-person services and knows many have chosen to continue drive-in or live-streamed services. It's up to the individual church, mosque, temple, or other house of worship. A recent spike in deaths in the state numbers Asked about one day this week in which the Virginia Department of Health statistics indicated a rise of dozens of deaths in a day, the governor reiterated a point state health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver has made before, which is that the deaths added to the state database in a given day don't necessarily line up with when the deaths occurred. That's due to delays between death certificates being filed, the healthcare agency reporting that death to their local health district, and the health district then reporting the death to the health department. So on the state level, they are focusing directly on the death certificates and their issued dates to analyze any potential spikes, following every death, because he said every death is important. Releasing data from point prevalence testing at long-term care facilities Dr. Forlano, who has been heading up Virginia's task force focused on responding to COVID-19 at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in Virginia, said there are 43 facilities statewide in the process of testing everyone for COVID-19 at this moment. That's in addition to point prevalence testing conducted at other facilities in recent weeks. While they'll be releasing aggregate data from that testing on the overall situation at Virginia long-term care facilities, they are not planning to provide specifics about the number of cases at any given facility, in line with previous health department guidance treating facilities as ""persons."" Memorial Day travel from areas in Phase 0 The governor issued a reminder that all Virginians in areas that are still under Phase 0 – Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County – are still under the 'Stay at Home' order and should only leave home for essential reasons. He urged them not to travel over Memorial Day weekend to other parts of Virginia that may be further along the reopening process. Regional reopening plans Asked about how those ares being behind the guidelines for the rest of the state will affect the overall reopening timeline, Gov. Northam once again went back to his description of the state guidelines as ""a floor,"" with regions able to have more restrictions, but not less. That plan is not changing, the governor said, but the rest of Virginia will not have to wait on Northern Virginia, Richmond, and Accomack County either. He said each of those areas will stay on their own timelines and is expected to move into Phase 1, 2, and 3 at different times than the rest of the commonwealth. What about reporting recovery numbers? Asked about why Virginia does not report the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver explained that the VDH system is set up to identify cases as they're reported and then trace any people potentially exposed to the Virginians with confirmed cases. The department does not provide care to the patients, so he said they don't necessarily know any information about the recovery of each person with a case. Instead, the health department's limit is reporting the cases as they get them, providing the information on those cases – including on local levels down to the ZIP code – and that's about it, because they don't have continuing data on each case. However, state officials do point people to the VHHA data reported each day, which tracks the number of active hospitalizations for COVID-19 and the number of previously hospitalized patients who have been discharged. There's a lot of information on patients who have recovered, officials said, especially since that encompasses at least 95% of people who contract the virus. And we should celebrate those who survive and recover, they said. The role of antibody tests Dr. Laurie Forlano said the VDH website has guidelines on when providers should use different kind of testing, like antibody tests, but said everyone is still learning about the best role of antibody testing in the process. She encouraged people to talk to their healthcare providers directly about potential antibody tests. In addition, health commissioner Dr. Oliver encouraged any Virginians who have gotten antibody tests and tested positive for the COVID-19 antibody to still take all necessary precautions to prevent getting the virus, because it's not clear yet whether testing positive for the antibody actually prevents someone from being infected. Stay safe on the roads if traveling Public health secretary Brian Moran said traffic on Virginia's roads has been significantly reduced throughout the pandemic as people stay at home, and they expect low numbers this Memorial Day weekend, but they have seen some ridiculous three-digit speeding tickets of drivers taking advantage of the empty roads. He encouraged anyone traveling this weekend to observe the speed limit, stay safe, and arrive safely. Memorial Day weekend and mask preparations Governor Northam closed out Friday's briefing by asking Virginians to mark Memorial Day with respect and remembrance for the many men and women who have paid the ultimate price in service of their country. He said to thank any active duty military members and veterans if you see them this weekend as well. He also said that he likes to give homework over the weekends, as he has mentioned at past briefings, and this weekend's has to do with masks. Even more strongly suggesting a pending mask order than earlier in the briefing, he said all Virginians should make plans this weekend for you and your family to have face coverings. All children 3 and up are encouraged to wear face masks in most guidance so far, and Northam said that's because children are likely to carry the virus without showing symptoms and potentially spread it to others. He encouraged Virginians to find any way to get face coverings that is available to them – whether that's by buying them at local stores, making them with online instructions, or using bandannas or other materials you already have. And be ready on Tuesday to go out with those face coverings when conducting any public business, if you're not already, he said. Meanwhile, his administration will be doing their work by finalizing the details of the new policy they expect to announce on Tuesday. Previous updates from Gov. Northam's May 20 briefing Spanish translation Governor Ralph Northam began Wednesday's briefing by noting that the Virginia Department of Emergency Management started offering a version of his briefings on Monday with live Spanish language interpretation on the VDEM Facebook page. That will continue for the foreseeable future. Virginia's data metrics and testing As is the norm for the governor, who has been noted throughout the pandemic as the nation's only medical doctor serving as a governor, he reviewed the most recent data on Virginia's COVID-19 case trends. Northam pointed to the state's percent positivity, which has been steadily decreasing over the past week with more testing. He reminded Virginians that there are multiple ways to get tested for COVID-19 amid the pandemic, including the most common avenues through healthcare providers, hospitals, and clinics, as well as through community testing events sponsored by local health districts. A key part of the testing process comes after a test returns with a positive result, and that's contact tracing – through which health department officials determine anyone who was in close contact with an infected person and instruct those people to self-quarantine. The governor touched back on a topic that state health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver has been addressing for a few weeks, which is that the Virginia Department of Health is working to hire 1,000 contact tracers and 200 supervisors for contact tracing efforts in the state. Access to PPE in Virginia After questions were raised in recent days regarding the supply of personal protective equipment in Virginia, Gov. Northam said that PPE is at a place where hospitals have an adequate supply. No hospitals have reported problems obtaining PPE for a few weeks now, but this week, the VHHA started publicly reporting the number of licensed nursing facilities that have indicated PPE shortages, and there are at least 10 without enough N95 masks and 21 without enough isolation gowns. The governor said the Virginia Department of Emergency Management has a stockpile available for any facility in need, but that healthcare providers need to let the department know, so that resources can be provided. According to Northam, VDEM, so far in the pandemic, has distributed more than 795,000 N95 masks, 1.3 million surgical masks, 3 million gloves, 285,331 isolation gowns, 427,000 face shields, and 24,359 containers of hand sanitizer to facilities around the state. He said the department's priority is to support response at facilities deemed high risk and to support those reporting need. But, Northam said, the directive has been that healthcare providers should exhaust supplies of PPE obtained from private supply chains before asking for public supplies. He said the Department of General Services established a rapid review process for vendors that can supply PPE to healthcare providers and has a list of suppliers online at dgs.virginia.gov. Northam also described a Virginia partnership with Amazon to support PPE orders directly and an effort by FEMA to ship PPE directly to Virginia nursing homes, with two shipments so far, each with at least a week's worth of equipment. If a facility has run out of PPE obtained through private supply chains, he said the facility needs to contact the Virginia Department of Emergency Management so that state officials can get them more. Access to healthcare Governor Northam took part of Wednesday's briefing to discuss access to health care in Virginia, which he said he believes is a right. The governor said the state's expansion of Medicaid in 2018 has allowed more than 421,000 Virginians to enroll in Medicaid coverage, offering health care to people who did not have access before. Praising the Medicaid expansion, Northam said families have been able to get treatment for underlying conditions that can make people more vulnerable to COVID-19 complications, and said everyone ""should be grateful"" for the expanded coverage during this pandemic. However, he said there's more work to do for all Virginians to have access to health care, so to help with that, he announced that he's convening a new work group that will focus on identifying ways to reduce costs and increase access to healthcare for all Virginians. Also, in light of his efforts to expand access, Northam commended the General Assembly for banning ""balanced billing"" in the most recent legislative session, but declared that he's vetoing three bills: Senate Bill 861, Senate Bill 235, and House Bill 795. The governor said each of those bills passed by lawmakers would address health care costs for targeted groups of Virginians but that he felt it best to veto them to focus on ""more broad-based health care solutions for all Virginians."" He encouraged the bills' sponsors to work with the new work group to find solutions for a broader group. AARP Virginia swiftly issued a response applauding the governor's vetoes, saying he ""used his veto power today to stop three health care measures that would have had a calamitous impact on older and sicker Virginians."" Substance abuse and recovery amid COVID-19 Gov. Northam said he's well aware that people in recovery from substance abuse disorders are facing increased challenges during the pandemic, describing increases in overdoses in Roanoke County and spikes of overdoses in the northern Shenandoah Valley specifically. He said his administration is working to respond to that situation by encouraging telehealth and loosening restrictions to allow more telehealth options for substance abuse treatment, promoting video meetings for recovery groups, and pushing other similar options. The governor said the Department of Behavioral Health has a list of ongoing virtual recovery groups on their website. Local and primary elections After Virginia's local elections on Tuesday, Gov. Northam said the day went smoothly, thanking Virginia's Board of Elections and the thousands of volunteers around the state who helped maintain safe polling places for in-person voting. Northam also thanked Virginians for following the state's recommendation to vote absentee by mail. He said more than 55,000 absentee ballots were cast for Tuesday, compared to around 1,700 in the comparable May local election in 2016. Looking ahead to the next election, Virginia's June primaries, he said the state is again is strongly encouraging people to vote absentee by mail. The deadline to request an absentee ballot, which can be done online or through your local registrar's office, is 5 p.m. on June 16, a week ahead of the election day itself o June 23. Live Health Equity Work Group meeting At 7 p.m. on Thursday, May 21, Virginia's Health Equity Work Group, which Gov. Northam has frequently discussed at his briefings, will be holding a live meeting that Virginians can view on WRIC, the ABC affiliate in Richmond. The Virginia National Guard's response As the Virginia National Guard has worked around the commonwealth to provide testing through local health district community testing events and coordinated nursing home testing, four Guard members have tested positive for COVID-19. The head of Virginia's National Guard said those four members were out of over 120 helping provide testing statewide and that none of the National Guard members working in the field are carrying the virus. He said they are rigorously screened ahead of each testing event. The Guard is focusing on testing as many long-term care centers as possible, with health department coordination, but that's just one component of their overall testing effort, according to Command Sergeant Major Ronald L. Smith Jr.. They've also requested funding from the federal government for the Guard to offer more resources at local testing events. How Virginia is helping in low-income communities Asked how Virginia is responding to the need for tests in low-income and minority communities around Virginia, Gov. Northam said he'll bring a list on Friday to highlight the lower socio-economic communities around the state with planned health district testing events. Northam said it's key to be able to enter Phases 2 and 3 that adequate testing is available to everyone around the commonwealth, and said Dr. Karen Remley's testing work group is working hand-in-hand with the health department to make that possible. He also thanked the work of free health clinics across Virginia, which have seen large increases in patients during the pandemic, even with dropping donations as they work to expand access to health care. Calling healthcare a right, the governor said he wants ""all Virginians to have access to quality and affordable care."" What data metrics are guiding future plans? Asked what data metrics he and his cabinet are using to determine when Virginia can begin Phase 2 or determine if any localities need to go back to increased restrictions, the governor said they're using the same metrics that were used to enter Phase 1. In particular, those focus on the number of new cases, percent positivity, the amount of PPE available, testing capability, hospital capacity and equipment available at hospitals, as well as staffing available at healthcare centers. Northam said each of those is based on guidance from the CDC and the White House, and their focus is on trends in the data over week and two-week spans: not particularly paying attention to day by day numbers, which vary. He said they currently do not have any specific thresholds, like a specific percent positivity increase, that would result in increased restrictions for a locality. However, the governor said his team meets every day to review the latest data to catch any potential dangerous increase in cases at a locality's level, since the best way to prevent escalations is to catch them at the start. He said if trends rise in a specific locality or zip code, action will be taken as needed, whether that be offering more testing or reversing Phase 1 guidelines, but said that hasn't had to be done yet. If any localities choose to ignore the state guidelines, regardless of data, Northam said he'll direct concerns about that to the locality. The future for Northern Virginia Governor Northam said his staff is in daily communication with leaders throughout Northern Virginia to determine how that region, which remains in Phase 0 at local leaders' request, will move forward. Asked about his response to specific localities, including parts of counties and cities in the area, requesting to enter parts of Phase 1 guidance, he said the policy is for the guidelines in place to be ""the floor"" and that localities within the area can go farther with restrictions but not loosen them to keep consistency for the region, which has also been coordinating with Maryland and Washington, D.C. While his team is following the latest data trends, Northam said he does not have a specific date set yet for the start of Phase 2, which would come, at the earliest, on May 29. Northam said it will happen when the data supports it and when local leaders are comfortable with it. Funding from the feds Asked about funding being provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Gov. Northam said a significant amount will be directed toward testing supplies and staff to administer tests at long-term care facilities, as well as boosting Virginia's contact tracing capability. Details of contact tracing On the note of contact tracing, health commissioner Dr. Norm Oliver was asked about the process and how information on people is shared. Dr. Oliver explained that contact tracers working with local health districts speak someone who has just received a positive test for COVID-19, have them isolate themselves, determine who the person has been in close contact with, and reach out to each of those people to instruct them to self-quarantine. Throughout the time that someone is self-quarantined, contact tracers stay in communication with them to help them manage the process and check in on how they're doing and progressing. If their condition changes, they're urged to seek treatment and testing. While people are under observation in self-quarantine, Dr. Oliver said their names are not released to the public, but that they do encourage people to release their names to healthcare providers for help with monitoring conditions, and assistance with getting food, medicine, and other services. How is information on community testing events being shared? Anytime a community testing event has been scheduled, the governor said health districts are reaching ",0.0

Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan said the agency has deployed hundreds of personnel who are currently serving in the region: “U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in coordination and with other federal agencies, has deployed more than 350 law enforcement personnel currently serving in the National Capital Region in order to protect the community from civil unrest related to recent protests. … CBP will not sit idly by while vagrants exploit our great community in Washington, D.C. We will rapidly respond to requests for assistance from our partner law enforcement agencies. This joint action is necessary to support federal law enforcement in their efforts to prevent civil unrest and harm to the citizens of our community. It is our sincere hope that local protests remain peaceful and without incident.” Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan CBP has also deployed aerial assets to aid in public safety and provide “situational awareness for our law enforcement partners on the ground.” CBP’s Air and Marine Operations provided a photos take from aerial assets deployed to aid in public safety and provide situational awareness for law enforcement officers on the ground. “CBP’s deployment of manpower and aerial assets is about supporting the efforts of our federal, state and local partners, not about carrying out CBP’s immigration enforcement mission. This is about the preservation of life and safety,” CBP tweeted Sunday. CBP personnel have deployed to the National Capital Region to assist law enforcement partners.

The unrest started in Minneapolis, where a police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the neck of George Floyd — who was handcuffed — for several minutes, even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too.

NORFOLK, Va. — Protesters calling for justice in the death of George Floyd moved onto Interstate 264 in Norfolk on Monday afternoon, causing traffic in both directions to halt. The closure happened before 6 p.m. at the Military Highway Exit 13B, which also shut down the ramps. The protesters were peaceful during their march. Traffic slowly began to move again in the area shortly after 7 p.m., with VDOT reporting all lanes and ramps back open around 7:45 p.m. “This is a peaceful protest, no violence,” said one protester in Norfolk. “Nobody is dying on my watch.” The group remained peaceful and onlookers joined in. “We asked them what they were marching for, they said, 'Just to make a change,'” said Norfolk protester David Waff. “We said, 'Yeah, we want to make a change with y’all.' So, we just started marching.” Waff and his family saw the group go by and felt compelled to join. “I have a black son, also,” Waff said. “I don’t want anything to happen to my family.

Mayor Levar Stoney condemned the destruction, which has played out in cities across the country following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. Stoney announced Sunday morning that Gov. Ralph Northam had granted his request for a curfew and said the National Guard was on standby to help enforce it. Police said one person in a vehicle was shot by a protester and the victim is in life-threatening condition. In separate incident, police said protesters set fire to a home occupied by a child and blocked the fire department from responding. 1 of 12 “We can not sit here idly and tell everyone here that these actions are productive — because they’re not,” Stoney said. “When you block law enforcement from allowing fire services to get to a home, an occupied home that has caught fire, you are not inspiring change.” The protests Saturday began peacefully but quickly grew violent when a crowd of at least 500 people marched to Capitol Square, where they ripped down a make-shift barricade and hurled bottles and traffic cones at a line of officers blocking the entrance with riot shields. The crowd left the area as a mass of state police officers approached, heading west to the city’s police headquarters, where the night before protesters had set a police cruiser on fire and broken out windows. Officers had fortified the area Saturday and responded almost immediately with teargas, flashbang grenades and nonlethal rounds. By midnight, protesters had dispersed throughout the city, lighting fires in trash bins, breaking windows and looting stores, including a state liquor store, a video game shop, and a CVS. At least two businesses burned, including a shoe store and a Rite Aid pharmacy that workers had been attempting to board up as the protest began. The sharpest clashes broke out east of the intersection of Broad and Belvidere in Richmond’s Arts District between 1:30 and 2:30 a.m., where protesters lit numerous fires, including a large barricade of trash cans and Dumpsters. Police in riot gear once again faced off with protesters, firing teargas while protesters lit fireworks. On Monument Avenue, home to the city’s largest Confederate memorials, protesters blanketed the massive statues with graffiti. At a memorial for Jeff Davis, the president of the Confederacy, a noose was left hanging around the bronze figure’s neck. Down the street, a fire burned inside the headquarters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, a group that helped erect Confederate memorials around the South and promoted the “Lost Cause” interpretation of the Civil War that “emphasized states’ rights and secession over slavery as causes of the war and was often used to further the goals of white supremacists in the twentieth century,” according to Encyclopedia Virginia. 1 of 8 Bystanders reported that incendiary devices of some kind were thrown through the front windows, and flames were visible to onlookers from the street and along the north side of the building. On Sunday morning, the members of the organization cleaned up but declined to comment on the extent of the damage, saying they were told not to discuss it because it was an active arson investigation. I was not surprised when I read it this morning. Black Richmond knows what the UDC is and always has been. https://t.co/DWW00iIIUk — Christy S Coleman (@HistoryGonWrong) May 31, 2020 Stoney said peaceful protests would be allowed to continue, but under the curfew announced, anyone outside between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. who was not travelling to work or seeking emergency services would be stopped by police. “At this point, bad actors are hijacking the cause,” he said. “They’re taking advantage of our pain, making a mockery of George Floyd’s death and using our frustration, our anger and our heartbreak to create chaos.” In a statement issued Sunday morning, Northam confirmed he had granted Stoney’s request for a curfew in Richmond. “I acknowledge each of the voices crying out for justice and healing across the United States and in our Commonwealth. I affirm the deep concerns from the black community,” he wrote. “I hear you. I know your pain is real. We have all seen too many people harassed, abused and killed by law enforcement officers, in too many places, for too long — just for being black. I also know that others are exploiting this pain and are now causing violence.”",0.0

Police Department WASHINGTON (AP) — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to “dominate the streets.” In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ’Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this ... again.’” The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer’s condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy “thousands and thousands” of U.S. troops. Full Coverage: America Protests The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. For nearly a week since Floyd’s death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don’t deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” the U.S. military will step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

In solidarity with the dozens of other Black Lives Matter demonstrations around the nation, people of all races and ages carried homemade signs and chanted statements like “Cops and Klan go hand in hand,” “White silence is violence,” and “No justice, no peace.” Others joined in by car, blowing their horns and waving signs as they drove along Market Street. “I was extremely pleased both with the turnout and the resiliency of the participants to remain peaceful…I am certain we got our message across,” says community activist and former Blue Ribbon Commission member Don Gathers, who spoke at the march. But he believes there should have been “tens of hundreds more” at the event. “Anyone with a pulse and a moral compass should have been out there protesting the disgusting murder and ongoing brutalization of blacks across this country,” he says. Don Gathers PC: Eze Amos The march was initiated by local resident Ang Conn, who, after seeing the murder of Floyd on video, felt “just completely distraught with what to actually do.” Floyd died after white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into the black man’s neck for nearly nine minutes, despite Floyd’s pleas that he could not breathe. (Three other police officers on the scene, who failed to intervene, were fired along with Chauvin, but only Chavin has been arrested.) Conn reached out to multiple racial justice groups and put a local team together to plan the Charlottesville protest, and get the word out. The event started at 3pm in front of the city’s police department, where activists, including Zyahna Bryant and Rosia Parker, led chants, gave speeches, and invited the crowd to take a knee. Demonstrators later marched down the mall to City Hall, then through Market Street Park, along Preston Avenue, and into Washington Park, chanting and listening to speeches from area activists and residents. Nearly all wore masks, bandanas, and other facial coverings. While police in other cities have responded violently to protesters (including in Richmond, where peaceful demonstrators were tear-gassed Monday evening), cops did not confront the crowd in Charlottesville, and the event remained nonviolent. CPD, which has been criticized in the past for heavy-handed treatment of protesters, chose to have “officers remain at a respectful distance, so that people attending could engage in civil discourse peacefully,” says spokesman Tyler Hawn. City Councilor Sena Magill was thankful that CPD took a hands-off approach to the protest, instead of “trying to stop it.” She says she’s also “proud of our community in general for coming out and saying enough is enough, and doing it in a way that was peaceful.” As for Conn, she says she hasn’t thought much about how it was peaceful, or how many supporters came out. “We’re protesting black people getting murdered. That’s not fun. It wasn’t a party [or] a get together. We’re in the middle of a pandemic and there are millions of black and brown people locked up in jail cells…which was also what this protest was about.” On Sunday, the Albemarle High School Black Student Union hosted a demonstration in front of the Albemarle County Office Building. Joined by community members, students of all races stood on the sidewalk in masks, chanting and holding signs with phrases like “Justice for George.” “We wanted to continue the momentum. It’s important for us to keep protesting peacefully and raising awareness,” says BSU president Faith Holmes. “We’re actually really happy with the way it turned out…we weren’t expecting the numbers that we had. It was fulfilling to see people from [the community] come out and support Black Lives Matter.” Moving forward, Gathers says he and other local activists will “continue to monitor the situation across the country,” and “should there be a situation that comes to light, God-forbid, here in Charlottesville, we certainly will be at the ready and quick to respond.” Charlottesville residents of all ages and races attended Saturday’s protest. PC: Eze Amos Charlottesville has its own fraught relationship with the police. Following community anger over the tear-gassing of counterprotesters during the July 2017 KKK rally, and CPD’s failure to protect residents during the violent Unite the Right rally later that summer, City Council created the Police Civilian Review Board to enhance transparency and trust. After years of controversy and disagreement over the board’s bylaws, City Council appointed seven members to the board in February, but the board has not yet met—an eighth, non-voting member, who was required to have prior law-enforcement experience, was appointed at Monday’s City Council meeting. Councilor Lloyd Snook, however, announced during the city’s Cville360 broadcast on Tuesday that the board could begin virtual meetings. Before Saturday’s protest, organizers also released a list of demands for the city, county, and state, which Conn read to the crowd on Saturday. It included an end to pretrial detention and home monitoring fees; the demilitarization and defunding of CPD; and the release of more people from jail and prison, especially given the current high risk of death from COVID-19. Several Charlottesville officials offered statements condemning Floyd’s death and police violence against the black community. And while Magill did not comment on the specific demands, she says the recent incidents of police brutality around the country “have been weighing heavy on all of council” and, from what she’s seen, council is “committed to true change.” “So many things are hard to get moving quickly, but we all know that we have to do something real,” she adds. “The time for thoughts and prayers is done—it’s been done.” Updated 6/3 to reflect the recent appointment of a new CRB member and the board’s ability to have virtual meetings",0.0

Protesters lined the streets in front of Saki Melius’ restaurant, Menya Ramen & Poke. “I respect and support the peaceful protest,” said Melius, saying she shares in their outrage over the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. But when nightfall covered the city of Denver, the protests turned violent. “Today I’m alone because my employees are afraid to come in,” Melius said. Agitators shattered her windows and set her dumpster on fire. She was forced to close her restaurant for two months due to coronavirus, and now this damage is another setback.

1623563531,2020-06-02 15:16:50,Community Organization Seeks to Activate Leesburg,https://loudounnow.com/2020/06/02/community-organization-seeks-to-activate-leesburg/,en,False,,304395,loudounnow.com,http://loudounnow.com/,"A new community organization is hoping to energize the Leesburg community and keep them engaged on issues of importance. It was an eventful inaugural week for Citizens for a Better Leesburg, a group organized by Leesburg Town Councilman Ron Campbell. Supporters gathered on Memorial Day at the historic African American Mt. Zion Community Cemetery in Leesburg to place American flags on graves of veterans. It was later that day that news broke on the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis, MN. Video footage that has been widely circulated shows Floyd struggling to breathe while an officer kneels on his neck, with Floyd pleading, “I can’t breathe,” an image strikingly similar to the 2014 death of a Eric Garner in New York and following recent high profile deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Floyd’s death has led to a week of unrest across the U.S., as the black community and its supporters stage demonstrations on injustice and police brutality. It led Campbell and those involved with the new community organization to schedule a peaceful demonstration in front of Leesburg Town Hall on Sunday afternoon. The demonstration soon became much larger than anticipated, and led to a peaceful march through the downtown area and speeches on the Loudoun County Courthouse lawn. Campbell said Monday he has been fielding calls from supporters on how the group plans to follow up with Sunday’s massive event, which drew upwards of 1,000 attendees. He said the goal of Sunday’s event was to show Floyd’s family and the people of Minneapolis that the Leesburg community cares about them. “I’ve been asked all day when’s the next protest,” Campbell said. “We’re not a protest organization, but what you should be thinking about is how you stay well informed, how you volunteer. Activism sometimes is raising your voice. I think we want to be that conduit to help people get engaged, stay engaged, and find ways to engage. There’s enough volunteer opportunities, boards, commissions, community organizations. I think this is a great time for the town to see some different energies. We need to make sure every voice matters.” On Memorial Day, members of Citizens for a Better Leesburg gathered at Mount Zion Cemetery to place American flags on the graves of veterans buried there. Campbell said he had the idea for Citizens for a Better Leesburg in 2018 during his mayoral bid. “I registered the Facebook page in 2018, thinking about what kinds of opportunities there are to help our community and engage voices. But I didn’t want to use it as a political arm; I wanted to use it as an advocacy group,” he said. “A few weeks ago, I was just talking with some of my advisors about my own future. The idea came up, why do we have to wait for elected officials? There’s enough good energy out here to do things without politics and getting involved in a partisan way.” The group has already started polling the community on another—how residents thinks Leesburg should use the $4.8 million in CARES funding the town has been awarded by the federal government, a matter expected to come before the Town Council next week. Campbell, whose council term is up at year’s end, has stayed mum on his own plans for public office, but has big hopes for what the community group can achieve. “I think what we want people to see is a very diverse group of interests, political backgrounds, interfaith populations willing to partner on any issue that gets brought to us. Most organizations are so one-issue dedicated. We want to help everybody do everything they want to do by activating the community, but we don’t own any issue,” he said. “We really do believe there’s enough good people in Leesburg and a small group of people have enough good connections that they can be a resource or conduit to help facilitate change. We’re not a problem-solving group, we’re not a protest or action-oriented group. We’re a group that’s concerned about Leesburg and we want to help however it’s necessary.” There is no formal membership or structure to the organization as of yet, Campbell said, and interested community members need only follow the Citizens for a Better Leesburg Facebook page to stay involved. Although there are no additional events planned at press time, information on those will also be posted to the page.

By the time the workers paused Tuesday morning, little was left of a spire that had become a lightning rod for controversy in recent years and a focal point for local protesters outraged by George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis. On Sunday, the obelisk — known formally as the Confederate Sailors and Soldiers Monument — was the site of a speech from Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, who pleaded with the crowd. Some protesters had already vandalized the monument and toppled another statue in the park, that one of former Confederate officer Charles Linn. Woodfin asked that demonstrators refrain from trying to tear down the much larger monument — so that his government could do it instead. ""Allow me to finish the job for you,"" the mayor told a crowd behind his mask and a megaphone. And he persuaded them to give him until midday Tuesday to pull the monument down. ""I wanted you to hear it directly from me. But I need you to stand down."" On Monday, Woodfin declared a state of emergency and implemented a curfew for the city, citing the previous night's protests during which police arrested at least two dozen people. Birmingham isn't the only city reckoning with its Confederate past in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Since the release of a video showing the black man's arrest in Minneapolis, during which a white officer plants a knee on Floyd's neck, protesters in several cities and towns below the Mason-Dixon Line have directed their frustration — and sometimes vandalism — toward local Confederate monuments. In Alexandria, Va., a statue commemorating Confederate soldiers came down Tuesday morning. It was removed a month earlier than scheduled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy due to fears of vandalism, according to The Washington Post. Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving. pic.twitter.com/CZTjlOkpfT — Justin Wilson (@justindotnet) June 2, 2020 This week's move likely isn't the final chapter in the Birmingham monument's story, which was knotty well before the latest spasm of unrest trained attention back on it. Woodfin's predecessor, William Bell, ordered the memorial partly hidden with plywood screens in 2017 following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued the city, citing a violation of a state law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, which protects against the relocation or alteration of Confederate symbols that have been up for more than four decades. A unanimous state Supreme Court decision last fall sided with the monument's supporters, bringing the plywood down and assessing a fine of $25,000 against the city of Birmingham. Now Marshall has threatened another lawsuit over the city's move. ""Should the City of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today,"" the attorney general said in a statement issued Monday, ""city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the [Alabama Memorial Preservation] Act to pursue a new civil complaint against the City.""

On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee begins the first of a planned series of hearings on the origins of the FBI's 2016 Russia investigation into possible ties with the Trump campaign. Republicans are particularly interested in the decision-making inside the Obama-Biden administration. Further, the Senate Homeland Security Committee late last month approved a subpoena along party lines for Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. ""The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the U.S. who is currently trying to be president got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $80,000 a month,"" said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, accused the committee's chairman, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., of abusing his power to aid Trump. ""We're in the middle of the worst public health and economic crisis in a century,"" he said, ""and what is Senator Johnson focused on? Running a political errand for Donald Trump by wasting Homeland Security Committee time and resources attempting to resurrect a craven, previously-debunked smear against Vice President Biden."" It is the allegation at the heart of Trump's impeachment — the president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and conspiracy theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and in December 2019, Trump was impeached for abuse of power by the House of Representatives for making the ask. The Senate acquitted the president in February after a contentious trial. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans using the Senate to try to help get Trump reelected. ""There are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee's attention but instead this committee is doing the president's personal bidding,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a potential contender to be Biden's running mate. During the first Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, senators will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., plans to subpoena 53 individuals, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former director of national intelligence James Clapper — all frequent Trump political targets. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had generally avoided weighing in on these investigations, but he fully embraced them in a recent Senate floor speech. ""No matter what some Washington Democrats may try to claim, you are not crazy or a conspiracy theorist if you see a pattern of institutional unfairness towards this president. You would have to be blind not to see one,"" he said. Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley, who testified against Trump's impeachment in the House, said investigations can be political and still have merit. ""I certainly believe that the oversight interests are stronger when you're looking at things like the Russia investigation. The Burisma controversy presents a more challenging question, however, I tend to favor some inquiry."" As vulnerable House Democrats experienced during impeachment, high-profile partisan inquiries can spark political backlash when voters have more urgent concerns — like the pandemic, the economy and social unrest. Graham was quick to announce last Friday that the Senate Judiciary Committee would also hold a hearing on police use of force. Democratic strategist Scott Mulhauser is a former Biden aide, and a former Senate aide. He said Senate Republicans — who are fighting to hold their majority this November — could be making a political blunder. ""It's an overreach here, an overplay of your hand with these hearings. Taking your eye off the ball is a mistake that could cost careers."" Graham says he would like to issue a committee report by October, ahead of Election Day. ",0.0

NEW YORK — The music industry is planning to turn off the music and hold a day to reflect and implement change in response to the death of George Floyd and the killings of other black people. Several top record labels organized Black Out Tuesday as riots erupted around the world sparked by Floyd’s death as well as the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Music-based companies Live Nation and TikTok, as well as the Recording Academy, posted to social media that it planned to support and stand with the black community. “On Tuesday June 2nd, Columbia Records will observe ‘Black Out Tuesday,’” the Sony label home to Beyoncé, Bob Dylan, Adele and John Legend said in a statement. “This is not a day off. Instead, this is a day to reflect and figure out ways to move forward in solidarity.” “We continue to stand with the Black community, our staff, artists, and peers in the music industry,” the company continued. “Perhaps with the music off, we can truly listen.” UMG’s Interscope Geffen A&M said that in addition to joining Black Out Tuesday, the label home to Lady Gaga and Kendrick Lamar would not release music this week — the first label to do so. “Instead, IGA will contribute to organizations that help to bail out protesters exercising their right to peacefully assemble, aid lawyers working for systemic change and provide assistance to charities focused on creating economic empowerment in the Black community,” its statement read. IGA postponed new music releases MGK, 6lack, Dylan, Jessie Ware, Smokepurp, Lil Mosey, Billy Raffoul, Max Leone and more in coordination with their partners Alamo, LVRN, The Darkroom, Bad Boy and more. Musicians including Rihanna, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Lil Nas X, Demi Lovato, Post Malone and Harry Styles have spoken out following Floyd’s death and the worldwide riots. Jay-Z released a statement late Sunday calling for Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to prosecute those responsible for killing Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck. “I, along with an entire country in pain, call upon AG Ellison to do the right thing and prosecute all those responsible for the murder of George Floyd to the fullest extent of the law. This is just a first step. I am more determined to fight for justice than any fight my would-be oppressors may have,” Jay-Z said. “I prevail on every politician, prosecutor and officer in the country to have the courage to do what is right. Have the courage to look at us as humans, dads, brothers, sisters and mothers in pain and look at yourselves.” Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Taylor to death in her home in March. The R&B duo Chloe x Halle, who will release their sophomore album “Ungodly Hour” on Friday, posted a cover of the classic civil rights anthem and protest song “We Shall Overcome” to Instagram. “This week has been very heavy for all of us. We’ve been trying to, not understand, because there’s no way to understand the terrible killings — we just have heavy hearts this week and are just trying to do everything we can to pray and lift each other up with our voices,” Halle said in an interview with The Associated Press.",0.0

Ben Sasse, R-Neb., speaks during a Senate Intelligence Committee nomination hearing in Washington. Sasse spoke out Tuesday, June 2, against President Donald Trump's use of the Bible as a political prop as the president warned protesters he would deploy the U.S. military to end violent protests against police brutality. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool, File) WASHINGTON – A handful of GOP senators spoke out Tuesday against President Donald Trump, criticizing his visit to a church after police removed peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House. The remarks came even as most Republicans continued to avoid any disapproval of the president. In a memorable scene captured live on television, police cleared Lafayette Park so Trump could walk to nearby St. John's Church and pose with a Bible. Trump’s actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. Some Republicans joined in the criticism on Tuesday. ""There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property ... but there is a fundamental — a Constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,'' said Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said Trump’s visit to the church was unhelpful and not something Scott would have done. ""Obviously, if your question is, should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo-op, the answer is no,” Scott told Politico Tuesday, while noting he did not personally see the incident. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it was ""painful to watch peaceful protesters be subjected to tear gas in order for the president to go across the street to a church that I believe he’s attended only once.'' While Americans are justifiably upset that the historic church was set on fire and vandalized, ""I thought that the president came across as unsympathetic and insensitive,'' she said. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., called Trump's walk to the church “confrontational” and said it ""distracted from his important message in the Rose Garden about our national grief, racism, peaceful protests and lawful assembly.'' That message ""was drowned out by an awkward photo op,'' Lankford said. Sasse, who has at times criticized Trump but won his endorsement for reelection, said public officials nationwide “should be lowering the temperature” over protests and violence following the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and one has been charged with murder in Floyd's death. “Police injustice — like the evil murder of George Floyd — is repugnant and merits peaceful protest aimed at change,'' Sasse said, adding that ""riots are abhorrent acts of violence that hurt the innocent.'' Both messages should be heard as Americans work to end violence and injustice, Sasse said. Late Tuesday, Trump addressed his GOP critics. “You got it wrong!” he tweeted. “If the protesters were so peaceful, why did they light the Church on fire the night before? People liked my walk to this historic place of worship!” The comments by the GOP senators were among the strongest by Republicans following Trump's demand Monday to end the heated protests and his vow to use military force to achieve that if necessary. Republicans have frequently muted any criticism of Trump, and only GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah voted in favor of Trump's impeachment in February. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking GOP senator, said that “as a general matter, I always think it’s a good thing for our elected leaders to be spending time at church.'' Still, Thune said views of Trump's actions were ""going to be in the eye of the beholder. His supporters are going to think ... he was standing up for the things he believes in and they believe in. His detractors are going to say it was a photo op.'' Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump likely ""thought this would be some unifying message, but of course it was for half the country, and the other half were outraged by it. And that’s just where we are, sadly.” On Trump’s threat to send in the military to quell violence, Cornyn and Thune said they hope Trump does not resort to that. While Trump “arguably” has the authority to use military force, “so far he hasn’t done it,'' Cornyn said. ""Hopefully, he won’t do it. It won’t be necessary. And we will try to bring some peace back to our communities.” Thune said he would “prefer that these things be handled by the state and local authorities. You want to de-escalate, rather than escalate.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday that “Democrats' obsession with condemning President Trump” was blinding them to more urgent priorities, such as ""ending the riots or advancing racial justice.'' McConnell condemned rioting in his home city of Louisville and other cities, even as he said the nation is united in horror and opposition to Floyd's death. “The legitimate and important voices of peaceful protesters will never be heard over the wailing of fire alarms, the smashing of plate-glass windows, and the sirens of ambulances coming for police officers who have been assaulted or shot in the head,'' McConnell said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he was glad Trump went to a ""historic church in our capital city that was firebombed by terrorists. It was important for the president to be there and say we will not be cowed by terrorists. All of us have a First Amendment right to speak, but you don’t have a right to burn a church.'' Collins, who is considered one of the Senate’s most vulnerable incumbents, said that at a time when the president “ought to be trying to calm the nation,″ Trump did not do that. __ Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor, Mary Clare Jalonick and Padmananda Rama contributed to this story.",0.0
1623582102,2020-06-02 15:20:18,"'First Super Tuesday' Of The COVID-19 Era: Voting Amid Protests, Pandemic",https://www.wmra.org/post/first-super-tuesday-covid-19-era-voting-amid-protests-pandemic,en,False,,144825,wmra.org,http://wmra.org/,"Facing a pandemic that continues to spread through the United States and protests nationwide over the killing of another black man at the hands of police, voters headed to the polls Tuesday in more than half a dozen states. It's a primary election date that was already going to be a challenge for election officials due to health concerns, even before nationwide unrest led to curfew orders in conflict with polling place hours in some places. In Washington, D.C., as well as the eight states voting Tuesday, the vast majority of ballots are expected to be mailed in. In Montana, for instance, election officials mailed every active registered voter a ballot. But the in-person voting options that are also required to be offered in many places create a unique problem. In Philadelphia, for instance, officials are trying to reassure voters they won't be arrested for voting in the Pennsylvania primary if the city decides to extend a 6 p.m. curfew to Tuesday. Polling places will stay open in the city until 8 p.m. ""Philly residents will not be arrested or prosecuted for going to or coming from voting tomorrow,"" District Attorney Larry Krasner told NPR member station WHYY on Monday. ""No curfew is going to interfere with any voter going to the polls. Please do not let these circumstances dissuade you."" Similarly, the District of Columbia's Board of Elections announced that vote centers, which are scheduled to be open until 8 p.m., would not be affected by a 7 p.m. curfew order in the city. ""Voters at Vote Centers and election workers are permitted to be at Vote Centers at 7, and are allowed a reasonable amount of time to get home,"" the board tweeted Monday evening. Across the country, jurisdictions are also having to adjust their in-person voting options to reduce health risks and accommodate massive poll worker shortages. The District is maintaining 20 polling places as a result of the pandemic, as opposed to its usual 144, and Philadelphia is also offering about a fifth of its normal locations. In Rhode Island, election officials are providing voters with ""one-time use stylus/pen combination devices"" to check in on electronic machines, and vote on paper. The secretary of state's office issued a seven-page report detailing how precincts should be organized and cleaned. Beyond the logistical concerns, the next question is simply whether people will be motivated to vote despite the obstacles, especially now that the Democratic presidential primary is all but wrapped up. ""We really are in uncharted territory for voting in America,"" Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the Voting Rights Project with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said on a call with reporters Tuesday. ""We won't know the impact of the challenges we're facing until much later."" Her organization runs a hotline (866-OUR-VOTE) that voters can call with questions or issues, and she said they received almost 3,000 calls in the past week. On Tuesday, the organization has fielded calls about Indiana voters facing long lines in Indianapolis, Maryland voters who say they did not receive their absentee ballots on time, and Pennsylvania voters confused by precinct changes. Johnson-Blanco called it the ""first super Tuesday of the COVID era,"" and she said that any problems encountered could be clues to issues that should be expected to sprout up again in the general election in November.

We get some good advice.  Guests Melissa Giraud, social justice educator, researcher and advocate. Co-founder of EmbraceRace, an organization that provides resources for parents to teach their children about race. (@RaceEmbrace) Andrew Grant-Thomas, social justice researcher and advocate. Co-founder of EmbraceRace. Former director of programs at the Proteus Fund, a national foundation committed to advancing justice through democracy, human rights, and peace. Deputy director at the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University. (@RaceEmbrace) Christian Cooper, avid bird watcher, comic book writer and biomedical editor for Health Science Communications. New York Audubon Society board member.  Interview Highlights Last week, a video of a white woman calling the police on Christian Cooper, a black birdwatcher in Central Park, went viral. Christian Cooper had asked the white woman, Amy Cooper, to leash her dog. Christian Cooper on how he felt during the confrontation and whether he was scared Christian Cooper: “Any sort of confrontation, of conflict, can be scary. So, yeah, I was scared. I wasn’t overwhelmed by being scared. But, yeah, I was certainly scared. But I think one thing I always try to keep in my head, whenever I’m engaged in any sort of conflict, because there’s always conflict in our society. You don’t want to seek it out, but at the same time, I’m not afraid of it either. You know, there are times when you’re going to have to be in conflict with somebody for various reasons. But the thing I always try to keep in my head is, ‘The person who remains calm wins.’ And that’s what I tried to do in that situation. I just tried to remain calm and just keep doing what I was doing.”  On talking with kids about race For white parents, expose kids to diversity Melissa Giraud: “You start young for one, and you start by exposing your child both, hopefully, in your neighborhood, in your community. … You know, if you’re in a segregated neighborhood, which many of us are, by going out to other communities. To expose them, whether it’s after school or at school, to people who are different from them racially and otherwise. And to make sure that your kids understand that you value difference. And you learn from it. And it’s important to you that they have diverse friends. So maybe you also can model that if it’s possible, again, in your neighborhood, in your part of the country.” On starting the conversation early Melissa Giraud: “It’s multi-factorial. So people often want a recipe and there isn’t a recipe. Like if we knew how to solve structural racism, systemic racism, we would have done it, you know? But we do know that the reason it’s so hard to solve is it’s systemic. And so there are a lot of things to do. So your kid is learning, you know, this cultural soup. They’re learning this stuff from very early. And if we could raise kids in a way that would preempt some of these biases by exposing them to a lot, so they’re not afraid. Also teaching them about injustice. And about their own privilege.”  On Point spoke to Ishmail Abdus-Saboor yesterday about how his family is processing the news of this week. As a black parent of two kids, he knew it was time to talk to them about what was happening blocks away from their home in Philadelphia. Here’s part of that conversation: Ishmail Abdus-Saboor: “I look scared as I was telling him these things. And I could equally see the fear on his face as I was sharing with him. And then, you know, out of nowhere, he asks me, ‘Does that mean we’re going back to being slaves?’ I mean, it wasn’t like slavery was on his mind. It’s not like we just had a conversation about slavery. So the fact that his mind went there and he made that connection, it was startling, jarring and it pierced a sword through my heart.” On how black parents can talk to their kids about race Melissa Giraud: “If your child is in a targeted group, this is something we think about a lot. … And it would depend on the conversations that you’ve had before as well. It’s more likely that black families in particular have spoken about racism and have also done sort of the countercultural work of cultural empowerment, of talking about freedom fighters like Christian. Of people who have resisted, have taken risks, really. Because they don’t know what the outcome will be, but have been able to stand up and to go on birding. You know, Chris has continued with this thing that he loves to do. … I would also say that showing the Floyd video, like we haven’t shown those to our kids. … You really want to not traumatize or re-traumatize kids who are already aware that they’re in some targeted group.” Andrew Grant-Thomas: “It’s important, I think, for kids to know that there are a lot of people who have done the work to get us, you know, to effect the kind of progress that we’ve made. Clearly, there’s a tremendous more amount of work to do. And we have allies in this work and we ourselves can do that work. Whether it’s about educating ourselves, about giving money to the organizations that are doing the work, it’s about giving our time. It’s about how we raise our children. Advocating, you know, being influencers in our own circles, there are a lot of things that we can do.” On the importance of asking questions Melissa Giraud: “Ask questions. … You can start with what they know, or what they think, or what’s their response to the video that Chris made of Amy Cooper. And talk it through.” Andrew Grant-Thomas: “I think we often don’t know, we’re not even aware that children are thinking about these things, making sense. That their sensibilities around race are emerging even very, very young, because we don’t create the space for them to show us. So this point about asking questions to me is largely about giving them the space to tell you, to share with you what they’re thinking again, what sense they’re making, what meaning they’re making. And for you to have an opportunity to share sort of your experiences, your ideas, your questions, and to provide some context, which, you know, as a four-year-old or a five-year-old, they probably don’t have.” On teaching white kids to be allies Christian Cooper: “I think the best thing you could do is teach young white kids to be good allies. To stand up for other people in difficult situations, and that might get us to a better place.”  From The Reading List New York Times: “Chris Cooper Is My Brother. Here’s Why I Posted His Video.” — “I grew up in a family of activists and my parents were teachers. They raised me and my brother, Chris, to never shy from fighting injustice. From police brutality, to the war in Iraq, to climate change, we’ve lifted our voices in protest.” EmbraceRace: “‘How do I make sure I’m not raising the next Amy Cooper?’” — “In our social media age, the figure of the ‘entitled White woman’ who calls the police on people of color, especially Black people, simply for living their lives has become so common that she has become a meme.” The Atlantic: “Becoming a Parent in the Age of Black Lives Matter” — “In a park about half a mile from my home is a wide-open field of grass, whose thin, uneven blades rise up past my ankles. The playground near the park is, like other playgrounds across the country, no longer open, surrounded by the orange-plastic fencing that has become unsettlingly familiar.” Houston Chronicle: “How to talk with your kids about police, race, protests” — “This week, the world witnessed video of former Houston resident George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck in Minneapolis. Floyd’s subsequent death sparked protests nationwide. Watching the tragic events unfold on TV or social media can take an emotional toll on most adults, but what about children?” Chalkbeat Colorado: “‘Moments like now are why we teach’: Educators tackle tough conversations about race and violence — this time virtually” — “Reading about Brown v. Board of Education over Google Meet. Holding one-on-one Zooms with students struggling with their emotions. Planning lessons on criminal justice reform for the fall — both in-person and remote, in case school buildings don’t reopen.” USA Today: “George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. What do we tell our children?” — “Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ‘the talk’ once again.” CNN: “How to talk to your children about protests and racism” — “As cities and social media explode with anger over the killing of yet another black man at the hands of police, worried parents struggle with how to protect their children from seeing the worst of the violence while simultaneously explaining the ravages of racism.” This article was originally published on WBUR.org.

Protesters marched along Fairfax Drive, chanting “I can’t breathe,” “Black Lives Matter,” and “no justice, no peace.” They also held signs: “silence is violence,” “justice for George Floyd,” and more. After arriving in Clarendon, the demonstrators held a moment of silence, with each kneeling and raising a fist. The protest started at 2 p.m. and was still on-going in Clarendon as of 3:30 p.m. Arlington County Police motorcycle officers accompanied the marchers, stopping vehicular traffic with rolling road blocks.

A large crowd took him up on it. “I want to begin today by saying I’m sorry,” he said. “What happened yesterday at the Lee monument was a peaceful demonstration, a demonstration that I, as your mayor, had asked you to do, to be peaceful.” With Police Chief Will Smith standing behind him, Stoney told the emotional crowd that officers will be held accountable for their actions at the peaceful protest. “When this involves children, that is wrong and inexcusable. Every peaceful protester should be allowed to protest.” Members of the crowd called Stoney a sellout, yelling that he is a black man who supports a system that oppresses black people. “I just want to say this, I am just as mad and upset about the things that happen to black people,” Stoney said. “I’ve been a black man for 39 years of my life, each and every day, it is in my DNA.” Members of the crowd demanded that the officers' badge numbers and names be released so that the community can ensure that they are held accountable. “I promise you disciplinary action will take place. I will expedite it,” Stoney replied. “We all work within the system and I know the system does not work for all of us.” Jared Ivey, an organizer for Monday’s march and Tuesday’s event with Stoney, read a list of potential police policy changes that a white ally sent to him. As Ivey was reading the list on his phone, members of the crowd were shouting over top of him expressing displeasure with the writer of the proposed changes being white. While it was hard to hear exactly what Ivey read, Stoney and Smith both appeared to agree with some of the proposals. Members of the crowd yelled for everyone to move back from the front as a young girl tried to ask the mayor a question while she sat on the shoulders of an adult. She told him she was scared of getting too close because she did not want to be tear gassed. “I don’t want you to think like that,"" said Stoney. The crowd and speakers continually noted that even though a peaceful march was held on Monday, tear gas still was deployed. “I can commit to you that such a thing will never happen again. I will march with you. I will stand with you” Stoney said. Organizer Natalie Andre’, a Howard University law student, told the crowd that “all lives don’t fucking matter because our lives don’t fucking matter.” She then turned to Stoney and told him that “I can’t support you if you don’t walk with me.” Smith briefly tried to speak to the crowd but his words over a megaphone were mostly inaudible due to the lack of a proper sound system. Smith did take a knee for a few seconds with organizers before stepping back onto the stage and handing the megaphone back to organizers. Stoney spoke once more before going back inside of City Hall. He said he will be at the Capitol building at 6 p.m. to march with the crowd to the Lee monument tonight.",0.0

Northam said that the heartbreak of watching a man in uniform take George Floyd's life is not a new heartbreak for black Americans. Racism and discrimination were not solved with the Civil Rights Act — black oppression has always existed in America, just in different forms, he said. ""I cannot know how it feels to be an African American person right now, or what you are going through. I cannot know the depth of your pain,"" Northam said. ""But what I can do is stand with you and I can support you. And together we're going to turn this pain into action."" Northam said his administration will continue to listen and learn and will hold virtual town halls to discuss criminal justice and public safety. Northam will also meet with the board of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police to make sure officers have adequate training to support positive community interactions. There will also be a statewide day of prayer and healing and action, Northam said. Virginia's African American Advisory Board and the Virginia Commission will continue to examine racial inequity in Virginia laws and code, with a focus on criminal justice and public safety. Northam said his message to protestors in Richmond and across the state is that he hears them and is ready to work with them. ""I pledge to stand with you,"" Northam said. The governor also invited several speakers to share their thoughts and comments on the protests and racial inequity that continues in Virginia and throughout the nation. Shirley Ginwright, representative from the Farifax County Communities of Trust Committee and member of the Virginia African American Advisory Board, said her experience goes back to marches with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ""It's clear we cannot go back to business as usual,"" she said. ""We have to make our legislators accountable. We have to change the books. We have to be there so the next generation will not go through the same thing that we're having to go through now, or that we went through 50 years ago.""

Please consider supporting our heartfelt mission for community journalism with a subscription! Coronavirus: Phase Two to begin Friday Northam announced that Phase Two of the Forward Virginia plan is set to begin Friday for most of Virginia. Northern Virginia and the City of Richmond will remain in Phase One because they only moved into Phase One on Friday and there needs to be more time to monitor heath metrics. Accomack County is still in Phase Zero and will not move forward because of high case numbers and outbreaks among poultry plant workers. According to Northam, Virginia is ready to enter Phase Two because of promising health metrics observed over the past three weeks. Hospitals are not reporting any shortages of PPE and hospital bed capacity is steady state wide. He said testing is increasing and the percentage of positive tests is decreasing. Northam said more details on Phase Two will be available on his website this afternoon and that there will be a larger discussion at his Thursday press briefing. Phase Two will include more flexibility for restaurants, gyms, sports, and outdoor entertainment venues. Here's what to expect in Phase Two, according to Northam: Allows for gatherings of up to 50 people Restaurants will have indoor seating at 50% capacity Gyms and fitness centers can have indoor classes and workouts at 30% of their capacity Pools can open with some restrictions Museums, zoos, botanical gardens and outdoor venues can reopen with some restrictions Recreational sports are allowed with physical distancing and no shared equipment Northam emphasized that Virginians are still safer at home in Phase Two and that the pandemic is still occurring. The governor also acknowledged that more people will need childcare and said the Department of Social Services is sending guidance to childcare providers. Northam said he will will discuss more details about Phase Two at Thursday's briefing and will talk more about childcare and youth sports.

1623623078,2020-06-02 16:17:09,Democrats say Justice Department whistleblowers to testify,https://www.wsls.com/news/politics/2020/06/02/democrats-say-justice-department-whistleblowers-to-testify/,en,False,,90694,wsls.com,http://www.wsls.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON – House Democrats say they will hear testimony from Justice Department whistleblowers and attempt to slash the agency's budget, efforts they say are in response to Attorney General William Barr’s defiance of Congress and “improper politicization” of his job. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler announced Tuesday that the panel will hear testimony from whistleblowers and former department officials who are prepared to describe “specific incidents of misconduct” and the politicization of the department under Barr and President Donald Trump. Nadler did not say who the whistleblowers are, and the hearing has not yet been scheduled. Nadler said the committee will also introduce a bill to slash the budget of Barr’s personal office by $50 million, legislation that is unlikely to pass in the GOP-led Senate. Barr has failed to appear before the committee for the year and a half he has been in office. He was scheduled to testify in March, but that hearing was canceled when Congress left town due to the coronavirus pandemic. Nadler said the panel has been unable to reschedule the appearance since. “Mr. Barr has thoroughly corrupted the integrity of the criminal justice system, he has shown contempt for Congress, and the committee has an obligation to hold him to account,” Nadler said. The Justice Department sent Nadler a letter this week citing White House guidance that cabinet-level officials are not permitted to participate in congressional hearings during the month of June without approval from White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, according to a person at the Justice Department familiar with the message. The person was not permitted to publicly release the letter and requested anonymity. The letter said Barr would be happy to consider testimony when that guidance expires, or at the “return of regular order to the House of Representatives."" Republicans have criticized House Democratic leaders for suspending most in-person activities during the coronavirus epidemic. Tensions have been high between Barr and the House panel ever since the attorney general declined to show up at a 2019 hearing on special counsel Robert Mueller’s report. Since then, committee Democrats have repeatedly said that Barr was politicizing the department as a way to protect Trump, including by overruling prosecutors to lower the amount of prison time it would seek for Trump confidant Roger Stone and by requesting the dismissal of its own criminal case against former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn. Nadler said the panel would file an amicus brief in the Flynn case. Nadler also criticized Barr for his role on Monday as officers under federal command used smoke canisters and pepper balls to force back peaceful demonstrators outside the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Barr was part of Trump’s entourage and was in Lafayette Park watching the demonstrations just before officers pushed back the crowd. Barr told Congress he couldn’t find the time to testify because of the coronavirus pandemic, Nadler said, “but took the time to tour the peaceful protests at Lafayette Park"" before the chaos unfolded. Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear the park, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. ___ Associated Press writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this story.",0.0

Dorn, a 77-year-old retired St. Louis police officer who served 38 years on the force was shot and killed by looters at a pawn shop early Tuesday,June 2, 2020, police said. David Dorn was found dead on the sidewalk in front of Lee's Pawn & Jewelry, which had been ransacked after peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd turned violent overnight. (Scott Bandle, Suburban Journals/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) ST. LOUIS – A retired St. Louis police captain killed by people who broke into a pawn shop after protests turned violent was a gregarious and outspoken leader who mentored youths and insisted on strict ethical conduct among his employees, a longtime colleague said Tuesday. David Dorn, 77, was found dead on the sidewalk in front of Lee's Pawn & Jewelry about 2:30 a.m. Tuesday. No arrests have been made. The shooting and theft apparently was posted on Facebook Live, but the video has since been taken down. It came on a violent night in St. Louis, where four officers were shot, officers were pelted with rocks and fireworks, and 55 businesses were burglarized or damaged, including a convenience store that burned. Police also shot and gravely injured a burglary suspect who they say shot at officers. Cities across the U.S. have seen protests and violence since George Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleading for air. Dorn, who was black, was a friend of the pawn shop’s owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, his wife, St. Louis police Sgt. Ann Marie Dorn, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. David Dorn served 38 years on the St. Louis police force before retiring in October 2007. He then became chief of Moline Acres, a small town in St. Louis County. Former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch knew Dorn for 30 years and said they became close friends when Dorn and his wife were leading the St. Louis police department's Explorers program for young people interested in law enforcement careers, while Fitch was leading the county's program. “He was very dedicated to youth, especially disadvantaged youth,"" said Fitch, who led the St. Louis County Police Department from 2009 to 2014. “He wanted to see them succeed. He wanted to be a role model for those young men and women to go into law enforcement.” Dorn' s personality was “bigger than life,” Fitch said. ""He was a fun guy, a happy guy. You never had to wonder what he was thinking when somebody did something incredibly stupid like a crime because he would just say it as he saw it.” When he took over as chief in Moline Acres, Dorn made it clear that his officers would be held to the strictest of standards, Fitch said. “He wanted them to do the right thing all the time,"" Fitch said. The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in St. Louis, said in a news release that Dorn was “the type of brother that would’ve given his life to save them if he had to.” St. Louis police Chief John Hayden called Dorn a ""fine captain.” “Many of us, the other officers, looked up to him,” Hayden said. ""Was very well-liked, very pleasant. And his wife still works here. So a very sad time for our agency. We will honor him.”",0.0
1623630910,2020-06-02 14:44:20,GOP criticism muted on Trump's handling of protests,https://www.progress-index.com/ZZ/news/20200602/gop-criticism-muted-on-trumps-handling-of-protests?rssfeed=true,en,True,,147801,progress-index.com,http://progress-index.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) "" Most Republicans continued Tuesday to avoid any criticism of President Donald Trump, though at least two GOP senators spoke out against police use of tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. ""There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property, and no right to throw rocks at police. But there is a fundamental "" a Constitutional "" right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,'' said Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said he did not think Trump's visit to St. John's Church was helpful. Scott said it was not something he would have done. ""Obviously, if your question is, should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo-op, the answer is no,' Scott told Politico Tuesday, while noting he did not personally see the incident. Sasse, who has at times criticized Trump but won his endorsement for reelection, said public officials nationwide 'should be lowering the temperature' over protests and violence following the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and one has been charged with murder in Floyd's death. 'Police injustice "" like the evil murder of George Floyd "" is repugnant and merits peaceful protest aimed at change,'' Sasse said, adding that ""riots are abhorrent acts of violence that hurt the innocent.'' Both messages should be heard as Americans work to end violence and injustice, Sasse said. The comments by Sasse and Scott were among the strongest by GOP senators following Trump's demand Monday to end the heated protests and his vow to use military force to achieve that if necessary. Republicans have frequently muted any criticism of Trump, and only GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah voted in favor of Trump's impeachment in February. After Trump's hardline speech Monday in the White House Rose Garden, the president walked to nearby St. John's Church, where he held up a Bible for photographers. Trump's actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking GOP senator, said that 'as a general matter, I always think it's a good thing for our elected leaders to be spending time in church.'' Still, Thune said views of Trump's actions were ""going to be in the eye of the beholder. His supporters are going to think ... he was standing up for the things he believes in and they believe in. His detractors are going to say it was a photo op.'' Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump likely ""thought this would be some unifying message, but of course it was for half the country, and the other half were outraged by it. And that's just where we are, sadly.' On Trump's threat to send in the military to quell violence, Cornyn and Thune said they hope Trump does not resort to that. While Trump 'arguably' has the authority to use military force, 'so far he hasn't done it,'' Cornyn said. 'Hopefully, he won't do it. It won't be necessary. And we will try to bring some peace back to our communities.' Thune said he would 'prefer that these things be handled by the state and local authorities. You want to de-escalate, rather than escalate.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declined to comment on Trump's actions, but said he was relieved there were no deaths and few injuries in the nation's capital Monday night. McConnell condemned rioting in his home city of Louisville and other cities, even as he said the nation is united in horror and opposition to Floyd's death. 'This selfish violence takes us farther away from any national healing or forward progress. It does not bring positive change any closer. It pushes it farther away,'' McConnell said on the Senate floor. 'The legitimate and important voices of peaceful protesters will never be heard over the wailing of fire alarms, the smashing of plate-glass windows, and the sirens of ambulances coming for police officers who have been assaulted or shot in the head,'' McConnell said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he was glad Trump went to a ""historic church in our capital city that was firebombed by terrorists. It was important for the president to be there and say we will not be cowed by terrorists. ... All of us have a First Amendment right to speak, but you don't have a right to burn a church.'' __ Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this story.",0.0

As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for the possibility of more violence, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn't do it. 'NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,' he tweeted. 'The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!' One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. 'Last night pushed me way over the edge,' said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. 'Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless."" The crowd remained in place after the city's 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights' demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: 'Peaceful protest!' On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John's Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. 'This has to change,' said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. 'Something has to give. We're done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.' In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday's protests. Macy's flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. 'We're going to have a tough few days,"" he warned, but added: 'We're going to beat it back.' He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and 'create peace.' Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city 'a disgrace.' 'The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,' Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation's largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. 'I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,' Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. 'I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.' On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. 'It feels like it's just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing's really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,' said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. 'There's always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we're seeing the breaking point around the country.' 'I live in this state. It's really painful to see what's going on, but it's also really important to understand that it's connected to a system of racial violence,"" she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump's threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. 'Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,' Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower's use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. ___ Sullivan reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0
1623630902,2020-06-02 14:49:19,Paris: Tear gas fired at protest against police violence,https://www.progress-index.com/ZZ/news/20200602/paris-tear-gas-fired-at-protest-against-police-violence?rssfeed=true,en,True,,147801,progress-index.com,http://progress-index.com/,"PARIS (AP) "" Tear gas choked Paris streets as riot police faced off with protesters setting fires Tuesday amid growing global outrage over George Floyd's death in the United States, racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics around the world. French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Police said at least 20,000 people joined the demonstration, defying a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Electric scooters and construction barriers went up in flames, and smoke stained a sign reading 'Restaurant Open' "" on the first day French cafes were allowed to open after nearly three months of virus lockdown. Chanting 'I can't breathe,' thousands marched peacefully through Australia's largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was 'shocked and appalled' by Floyd's death. Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America "" and now, beyond. As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries. 'This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,' Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, 'all blacks live this to a degree.' Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden. But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice. As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city's frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille. The demonstrations were held in honor of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases 'have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics "" and that his last words were 'I can't breathe.' 'I can't breathe' were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. 'I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,' said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. 'What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here."" Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere. 'We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,' he said after pausing 21 seconds before answering. 'But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada.' More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that 'like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.' He underlined that Europeans 'support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions.' German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are 'understandable and more than legitimate.' 'I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,' Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. 'It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,' Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., 'that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country.' Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color 'is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.' ___ Associated Press writers Rick Rycroft in Sydney, Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, Lori Hinnant in Paris, Aritz Parra in Madrid, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Lorne Cook in Brussels, Peter Dejong in The Hague contributed. ___ Follow AP's latest news about the protests at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd",0.0

More than 250 people gathered at 5 p.m. Saturday, May 30 for a peaceful protest at the corner of Sudley Road and Sudley Manor Drive, about five miles from Manassas. They were protesting the death of Minneapolis resident George Floyd, 46, who died during an arrest attempt by a police officer who is now charged in his death. Just after 8 o’clock, the rally turned unruly with protestors throwing objects at drivers and police. A riot ensued resulting in multiple police agencies descending onto the county, with officers donning helmets and shields, leading five arrests — including the arrest of a driver charged with DUI and other offenses for driving through a police perimeter, nearly striking officers posted at the location, police said. Four Prince William police officers were injured during the riot, one suffering a significant head injury requiring treatment at an area hospital. Virginia State Police, one of the agencies called to assist Prince William, used pepper spray and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. Those actions prompted residents to contact Supervisors with questions about the actions taken by police against protestors, they said. During the Sunday meeting, Supervisors heard a briefing about tactics used to disperse the riot. Prince William County Police Department Deputy Chief Lt. Col. Jared Phelps told Supervisors he arrived on the scene at 8 p.m. to find groups of protestors on the corner of Sudley Road and Sudley Manor Drive, as well as a large group within the median, choking the flow of traffic. “We realize that not everyone was there to protest in a violent manner,” said Phelps. Phelps told supervisors that there were individuals present who were not there to protest peacefully or legally. Later in the evening, Prince William police received reports of people jumping on cars about 11 p.m. Because of this, police called an unlawful assembly. Police were planning for a peaceful protest On Friday, Prince William police received a tip from another law enforcement agency in the form of a Snapchat message about plans for a protest Saturday. Prince William mined social media in an attempt to determine the credibility of the tip that agency had forwarded and eventually spoke to a potential protest organizer. From the conversation, the police learned that the event was going to be peaceful, said Phelps. “That’s what we want. As a department, we’re here to safeguard all the [First Amendment] rights for everybody. We want people to protest in a lawful, legal way so they can exercise their First Amendment rights,” said Phelps. Afterward, Prince William asked for help from Virginia State Police to have plans and resources in place to ‘handle certain situations.” Phelps says his department coordinated with state authorities because of the protest’s potential effect on nearby Interstate 66, which falls under the jurisdiction of state police. The first protestor arrived at 4:30 p.m., and from there the number of protestors swelled. “We had given them some leeway in the fact that they were crossing over into the median, which is dangerous absolutely, but we were allowing latitude because we wanted everyone to exercise their first amendment right and protect that. [We wanted to] protect the area, we felt we could do that,” said Phelps. Police call in backup Prince William received information about its officers being surrounded by protestors at about 7:30 p.m. The department called for additional resources and assistance from nearby localities to regulate the protest, including Manassas, Fairfax County, and Virginia State Police, as they felt it was starting to get dangerous. As more officers were moved in, conditions quieted down. At this point, Prince William backed off its request for additional assistance. Virginia State Police deployed rubber bullets and gas on individuals However, some who weren’t at the peaceful protest showed up and started throwing objects at law enforcement, and Prince William called in help from the state police. Prince William police believed that some individuals attempted to march on I-66, reinforcing its decision to call for backup. The two agencies worked together and held a line, stopping a group of rioters at Rosemary Drive, about a half-mile west of Sudley Manor Drive. Police held this position for “quite a while.” After they cleared the cars, Sudley Road was closed between Balls Ford Road and Lomond Drive. As the riot continued later into the night, state police used rubber bullets and pepper spray to subdue the rioters. Phelps told Supervisors that while he was not the one in charge or to give the order to use rubber bullets or gas, he takes full responsibility for the actions taken by state police as it was the agency in charge of handing the riot. Prince William does not train its officers in the use of rubber bullets but does provide training on gas. Virginia State Police troopers are trained in both. Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller gave Potomac Local News this statement: “Once the Unlawful Assembly was declared by the Prince William County police and the protesters’ violence escalated against law enforcement, state police utilized non-lethal tactics in an effort to disperse the crowd and restore order. The actions taken by state police are within state police policy and were necessary for the safety of our personnel and for the community. As the protesters became more aggressive with throwing bricks, large rocks and bottles at law enforcement, state police had no choice but to respond with different non-lethal tactics – OC “pepper” spray and powder, and rubber pellets. No CS gas was ever deployed by state police Saturday night. By the time the crowds finally dispersed early Sunday morning, a total of 10 Virginia State Police troopers were injured. Fortunately, injuries were minor and only one trooper had to be transported to a nearby hospital for treatment.” Woodbridge District Supervisor Margaret Franklin questioned the use of pepper spray to disperse the crowd. “I would not want that used if we can avoid it if at all possible. [Lt. Col. Phelps] and I had a very good discussion about that last night and you did clear that you guys were not using that, that you had no intention of doing that if at all possible. And you did reveal that the state police had used it. And I just want to say to the public that I stand by that,” said Franklin. Fairfax County police protected businesses During the night, the Fairfax County police sent officers to protect surrounding businesses from possible damage from rioters. At least five businesses that were damaged Saturday night, one of which involved an individual attempting to ram their car into the back of a store. The riot broke up about 12:30 a.m. Sunday. Woodbridge Supervisor Margaret Angela Franklin wrote on Facebook Sunday that she was against the use of tear gas. “Please know that while those protests were taking place, myself, along with several of my colleagues made it clear to County police that we are against the use of tear gas. However, state police did in fact use tear gas and pepper spray. Several members of both the state and congressional delegations have made several calls to State police and the Northam Administration to figure out what happened and why the use of tear gas. I will share more information as that becomes available.” “Call for Calmness” Supervisors asked Phelps what police need to help quell the unrest, and if the department wanted leaders to enact a countywide curfew. Phelps declined and, instead, asked members of the Board of Supervisors to “call for calmness” amongst their constituents. “Please. Please. Legally, peacefully, we want to help everyone protest and exercise their first amendment rights as much as we can, but we have to do this in an orderly, peaceful manner,” said Phelps. More violence Following the emergency meeting, police in Manassas declared an unlawful assembly after another protest that began peacefully ended in violence, with the windows to several businesses on Liberia Avenue being shattered. Last night in Gainesville, protestors who had been marching on sidewalks in the Gainesville area with a police escort for most of the day spilled onto U.S. 29 about 10 p.m., forcing the closure of a portion of the highway. Earlier in the evening, further south in Fredericksburg, protestors on the Cambridge Street Bridge over the Rappahannock River smashed the window of a car that was trying to bypass a line of protestors who had linked arms and formed a human wall. One of the protestors smashed the windows of the car causing the shattered glass to fall onto the three occupants of the vehicle, including a one-year-old child. The Stafford County Sheriff’s Office, which already had deputies on the scene, deployed smoke, and later CS gas to disperse the crowd. No one was seriously injured.",0.0

The City of Fredericksburg declared a state of emergency and issued an 8 pm curfew yesterday, June 1, in response to protests within the city. The curfew will last until June 3, and it prohibits residents of the city from being in public between the hours of 8 p.m to 6 a.m. The curfew, however, does not apply in all situations. ‘Traveling to and from work and medical emergencies’ are situations in which the curfew does not have to be followed, according to the Fredericksburg Police Department. According to a press release from the City of Fredericksburg, the police department has created a Curfew Education Plan of Action to ‘ensure protesters understand the curfew and have ample time to leave on their own accord.’ It is as follows: 7:30 p.m. – Officers will make announcements over loudspeakers educating citizens the curfew begins in 30 minutes. The announcements will continue until all crowds have dispersed. Officers will also distribute copies of the curfew to educate citizens. 8:00 p.m. – Officers will approach all remaining citizens and ask them again to disperse as the curfew is in effect. 8:15 p.m. – Officers will continue to make announcements and hand out copies of the curfew order. 8:30 p.m. – Officers will approach remaining citizens and, once again, speak to them individually about the need to obey the order. Citizens who do not comply will be arrested. “Please be assured we will work diligently to ensure our community’s visitors are cared for with respect and compassion. If they [protestors] do not obey our orders, we will work to enforce the curfew to maintain our community’s safety and order,” said Fredericksburg Police Chief Brian Layton. The plan, which was enacted at last night’s protests, was not adhered to by protestors. “The Curfew Education Plan was executed and protesters ignored the curfew order. From 8:00 p.m. till approximately 11:00 p.m., protesters walked in public roadways, attempted to gain entry to parked vehicles, and placed objects in roadways to block traffic. At 10:15 p.m., officers began issuing citations for violation of the curfew and pedestrian in roadways. Fifteen people were charged with these citations and released on their own accord,” stated a press release from the City of Fredericksburg. The June 1 protests began at 3 p.m. with a small group of people walking down the sidewalks in downtown Fredericksburg. As the group grew and time passed, protestors began to walk in the roadways. “Protesters were stretched across two lanes of traffic on Caroline Street, ignoring motorists and putting themselves as well as drivers in danger. Protesters continued to display unlawful behavior walking in roadways, spray painting parked vehicles, and destroying property,” stated a press release from the City of Fredericksburg. Protestors then began to march across Falmouth Bridge, entering Stafford County. On the bridge, unidentified members of the protest smashed the window of a vehicle containing a man, woman, and infant child. The glass landed on the child, whose injuries appear to be non-life threatening, according to the Stafford County Sheriff’s Office. Stafford County authorities used CS gas (teargas) on the protestors in an attempt to subdue them. No CS gas was deployed in the city of Fredericksburg.",0.0

Stoney organized the event, which started at noon, as a way to apologize for the Richmond police officers who deployed tear gas on protesters at the Robert E. Lee memorial on Monday. Richmond Police tweeted an apology after the incident. First, RPD tweeted that violent protesters were blocking officers from reaching safety. Later, Richmond Police Chief Will Smith reviewed the footage and removed officers from the field. Chief Smith just reviewed video of gas being deployed by RPD officers near the Lee Monument and apologizes for this unwarranted action. These officers have been pulled from the field. They will be disciplined because their actions were outside dept protocols and directions given. — Richmond Police (@RichmondPolice) June 2, 2020 Protesters had several demands for Stoney at the town hall, including releasing badge numbers of the officers who incorrectly used tear gas, releasing detained protesters and lifting the citywide curfew that is in effect from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m until Wednesday. As demonstrators dispersed after the town hall, protester Michaela Hatton asked the crowd to hold city officials accountable for demands. “Don’t just stand there,” Hatton said over a bullhorn on the City Hall steps. “Ask for accountability. Demand accountability.” Stoney and Smith are expected to march with protesters beginning at 6 p.m. at the State Capitol. Town hall attendee Asia Trimble said that Stoney’s message served as an apology, but failed to offer a solution. “You’re not telling us what you can do in the future to make this better, you’re not elaborating on any of that,” Trimble said. “You’re just working on our emotions, and baby that’s not going to work, because we’re already emotional.” Mem Koroma, a protester who has been demonstrating on Friday, said Stoney’s “priorities aren’t straight” as she was walking to the town hall. She said that Richmond police officers’ use of tear gas was a “fireable” offense. “Yesterday was probably the most peaceful protest we’ve had in the past five days,” Koroma said, “and then look how violent they reacted.” Protests started on Friday in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis. The incident, which was caught on video, sparked nationwide protests. The Richmond Community Bail Fund has been raising donations to assist detained protesters in paying bail. The group said on Twitter that the fund has raised more than $400,000. We are totally amazed at the amount of support these last few days—thanks to your individual donations, we’ve raised over $400k!!! We encourage everyone who supports our work to donate to Richmond Mutual Aid as well.

(WRIC) — Despite the city’s 8 p.m. curfew taking effect, police seem to have remained largely on the outskirts of Tuesday’s protest march through Richmond. 8News joined protesters during the march as they move through Richmond. The crowd turned onto Arthur Ashe Blvd. before going east onto Monument Ave. near the Jefferson Davis Monument and then along Franklin St. At this time, there has been no sign of police around the march or any arrests reported. Despite Richmond’s curfew being in effect, a crowd of demonstrators have now begun to march towards W. Broad Street as part of Tuesday’s protests.

Spitting Video Not What It Appears — An frame-by-frame analysis of a viral video that appears to show RPD officers spitting on a detained prisoner shows it did not happen as activists have claimed. — Richmond Police (@RichmondPolice) June 3, 2020 In a tweet sent by Richmond Police, officers say “an frame-by-frame analysis of a viral video that appears to show RPD officers spitting on a detained prisoner shows it did not happen as activists have claimed.” Richmond Police later identified the prisoner as a “protester.” According to police, the video captured Monday shows officers coughing and spitting onto the grass as a result “to exposure to tear gas.” A slow motion analysis shows the officers spitting on the grass and not on the detainee who was sitting on a nearby curb. The frequent coughing and spitting was due to exposure to tear gas. — Richmond Police (@RichmondPolice) June 3, 2020 8 p.m. — Lt. Gov.

Fairfax tweeted out his intentions earlier in the day with a message for Richmond police to “put your tear-gas away and listen.” 8News was told that Fairfax plans to be out in the city past the curfew. 6:30 p.m. — Richmond mayor speaks with 8News while joining protest Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney addressed growing calls for him to resign while walking alongside demonstrators during Tuesday’s protest in the city. Earlier in the day, the mayor spoke with hundreds of people outside City Hall who were upset with Richmond police who threw tear gas at protestors before Monday’s 8 p.m. curfew. The crowd demanded for Stoney, RPD Chief William Smith and others to step aside as a result and some challenged the mayor to march with them later in the day. 8News’ Ben Dennis caught up with Stoney during the Tuesday’s march and spoke with him about his decision to join protestors and pressure put on him to resign. “Because number one, I’m a man of my commitment,” Stoney said when asked why he was walking with protestors. “I apologized today for what happened with the tear-gassing and so, they asked me to walk with them and here I am. I feel and support the pain that they’re feeling. As a black man, I’ve experienced some of what we’ve been seeing in the images and I’m here to express my opinion as well.” Read more here. 5 p.m. — Virginia National Guard troops deployed in Richmond ahead of protests The Virginia National Guard has been deployed in Richmond ahead of planned protests Tuesday outside the state Capitol. Alfred Puryear, a spokesperson for the Virginia National Guard, told 8News that the soldiers and airmen “are providing direct support to the Richmond Police Department, Capitol Police and Virginia State Police to help keep their fellow Virginians safe.” A National Guard sergeant told 8News’ Ben Dennis that troops have been in the area since Sunday, but have only been out at night. Even before Tuesday’s protest outside the Capitol — which is expected to begin at 6 p.m. — Richmond police urged residents to avoid downtown in a tweet. “Please avoid downtown Richmond as protesters have assembled there,” a tweet from Richmond police said Tuesday. “They are currently concentrated in the area of E. Broad and 11th Streets. They are heading westbound at the time.” 8News’ Jackie DeFusco recorded video of several vehicles with National Guard soldiers inside leaving Capitol Square and turning onto Broad St. The increasing public presence of the National Guard comes after protests Monday where tear gas was fired at demonstrators near the Robert E. Lee monument in Richmond before the city’s 8 p.m. curfew. Richmond’s mayor and its police chief apologized after videos surfaced on social media of people being gassed before the curfew was in effect. Monday was the fourth consecutive night of protests in the wake of death of George Floyd, who died on May 25 after an encounter with four Minneapolis police officers who were responding to a call that he had allegedly used counterfeit money to purchase cigarettes from a local store. Video taken from the scene showed the officers pin Floyd, who was handcuffed, to the ground for several minutes. All of the officers involved were fired and the officer seen on video kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he complained that he couldn’t breathe, Derek Chauvin, was eventually charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.",0.0

Community leaders, such as the South Boston Chief of Police James W. Binner, took turns speaking and saying they were in support of the peaceful gathering. The organizer for the event, Nevaeh Hodges, says she was pleasantly surprised by the big turn-out. Many say she should be proud she pulled it off considering the fact that she’s a 17-year-old high school student. “I saw a lot of people who usually don’t really speak out on issues start speaking out for this one,” said Hodges. She says she got the idea for the protest when she realized her community’s response to the death of George Floyd. “I just went on facebook and my entire timeline was just people my age saying this isn’t right, justice for George Floyd and I was like other people here, they want to have a voice too.” So Hodges made calls to make it happen, and hundreds of people showed up in support of her vision. “I was excited that so many people were coming. I was also scared of disappointing people.” However, people like William Barksdale were anything but disappointed. “She probably didn’t expect this many people, but when you’re doing the right thing, people are going to show up,” Barksdale said. He says he can relate to what’s going on. “I’m 56 years old so it’s been happening my whole life and before my life. Lately it’s been a whole lot of cops killing people.” He says the issue of George Floyd’s death should be something that all people can relate to regardless of race. “It don’t matter what color you are. If you got anything for humanity, you’re going to feel that pain. Any time a man calls out for his mother, and his mother is dead. That’s gotta be some serious pain.” Anna Jones says it was important for her to come to show her support. She says she’s glad the event was peaceful, unlike others she’d heard about. “This is how it’s supposed to be. I think when you get lost in the violence you lose the whole purpose of why people are here. More violence isn’t going to fix the violence that’s already been done,” said Jones. Hodges says after talking with people they would like to have other events to continue to keep the community engaged.

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E) COLUMBIA, S.C. – Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional. From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place — in some cases for the first time in decades — sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets. But the deadlines aren't hard and fast — many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on violent unrest. In New York City, an 11 p.m. curfew was originally put in place this week for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years. Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled it back to 8 p.m., but thousands of people defied the curfew Tuesday night, continuing to march in parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan. After initially standing by and letting protesters continue, officers began ordering people to leave and some people were taken into custody. On an overall calmer night in New York City, de Blasio said the relative quiet was due partly to the curfew. "" So far, the curfew is certainly helping, based on everything I’ve seen in Brooklyn and Manhattan over the last three hours,"" de Blasio tweeted. A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. And curfews can be a deterrent to get law-abiding citizens off the street and allow police to focus their efforts on the unrest and not get bogged down in run-of-the-mill violations. They have been installed in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit, Denver, Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities and communities across the country. Curfews aren't unusual in the United States but are typically used in natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to allow law enforcement to stop anyone on the streets and prevent stealing when many homes and empty or damaged. New York City has used curfews in specific locations like parks — sometimes with controversial results. The 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot in Manhattan had to do in part with a then-newly imposed 1 a.m. parks department curfew in a bid to rid the park of drugs and crime. In enforcing the curfew, police flooded the park with officers and were accused of rampant abuses. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani ramped up enforcement of Central Park’s nightly closure after a string of robberies in the late 1990s. Giuliani was so strict about the curfew, he wouldn’t grant an exception for a late-night vigil to John Lennon, despite intercession from the lord mayor of Liverpool on behalf of aggrieved Beatles fans. During the unrest of the past week, police also want bystanders off the street during unrest — and the curfew solves that. ""The curfew really is to keep people from coming sort of to gawk at what’s going on and keep the looky-loos away,"" said Sacramento City Councilman Steve Hansen, whose city's 8 p.m. Monday curfew appeared to help prevent the destructive demonstrations from the night before. The curfews also come on the heels of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, making for an unprecedented stretch in cities like New York. In Columbia, South Carolina, officials lifted a weekend curfew and the mayor joined an afternoon protest at the state capitol calling for police reform. But several dozen people stayed for hours after the protest ended as tensions with police grew as shadows got longer. Just before 7:30 p.m. Monday, Columbia, South Carolina , Mayor Steve Benjamin set a curfew for 7:45 p.m. for a small area of downtown and an areas of restaurants and shops. The city sent an emergency notice and protesters looked at their screens as their phones started to buzz and the curfew set in. The protesters immediately started to walk away. But some civil rights organizations think hastily issued curfews are unfair and against the First Amendment of the Constitution. “By making presence on public streets anywhere in these cities unlawful, these measures give police too much discretion over whom to arrest,” said the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California after a number of cities issued curfews. New York City on Monday found out an unintended consequence of a curfew is keeping away law-abiding protesters. The night before, they banded together to stop vandalism and help police find lawbreakers. It also sends a subtle message, said New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez. “Implementing a curfew and increasing the number of police officers patrolling the streets is a tactic to effectively silence the voices raised in protest against the abuse of power and looting of black and colored bodies by members of the police,” Rodriguez said. Curfews can cause other problems too. Charleston, South Carolina, had a curfew for three days after late night Saturday protests led to shattered windows for restaurants and businesses and stolen merchandise downtown. Monday night was quiet. And Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said he immediately heard from a certain group of people. “We want to give our businesses a chance to get back into business,"" Tecklenburg told his City Council at a Tuesday meeting lifting the curfew. A curfew also allows police to separate people who want to protest while following the law from people who want to cause harm, said Tamara Herold, an assistant professor in the Criminal Justice Department at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. That makes it easier for law enforcement to decide how to use force to break up unrest. “One of the things police always want to avoid is using indiscriminate force against a large crowd,” Herold said. ___ Associated Press Writers Claudia Lauer and Adam Beam contributed to this report.",0.0
1623647896,2020-06-02 17:16:01,Some governors balk at Trump request to send troops to DC,https://www.wsls.com/news/politics/2020/06/02/some-governors-balk-at-trump-request-to-send-troops-to-dc/,en,False,,90694,wsls.com,http://www.wsls.com/#spider,"RICHMOND, Va. – Some governors are rejecting President Donald Trump's request to send National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., for a massive militarized show of force in the nation’s capital after several days of unrest over the death of George Floyd. Several states, including New York and Virginia, have so far rejected the request, with at least one governor citing Trump’s rhetoric about using troops to “dominate” protesters as a reason why. All of those states are led by Democrats. Meanwhile, several other states around the country are sending troops to Washington with more expected in coming days. The Trump administration has asked multiple states to send troops to Washington at the same time as the president derided many governors as “weak” for not using the National Guard more aggressively in their own states. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam rejected a personal appeal from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on Monday to send thousands of the state’s National Guard members to Washington D.C., the governor's office said. Northam said he was concerned that the Trump administration would misuse the troops to escalate tensions. “I am not going to send our men and women in uniform — a very proud National Guard — to Washington for a photo op,” Northam said, referencing an incident Monday when police used tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump has declared himself to be the “president of law and order” and has vowed to deploy the U.S. military to America’s own cities to quell a rise of violent protests, including ransacking stores and burning police cars. Floyd died last week after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across the U.S. The president's critics say Trump is deepening divisions at a time when leadership was crucial to help unify a fractured country. Delaware Gov. John Carney's office said the state did not send troops because Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser did not request “additional assistance,” a reason Northam also cited. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday he was unaware of any request to send New York's Guard to Washington but said he wouldn’t have granted such a request because they are needed at home. Richard Azzopardi, a senior adviser to the governor, said 200 New York National Guard troops were requested and the decision to deny the request was made at an agency level that did not directly involve Cuomo. Trump has been particularly critical of how officials have handled looting and violence in New York City. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart,” Trump tweeted Tuesday. Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declined to dispatch any National Guard members to Washington, while Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said he is still evaluating the Trump administration's request. Other governors have been more receptive. Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said almost 1,500 guardsmen were coming to Washington on Tuesday from several states and more were expected Wednesday. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said his state's troops were sent “explicitly to protect federal buildings and federal monuments.” Murphy is the only Democratic governor who has sent troops so far. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, also a Democrat, said the Connecticut Air National Guard may provide help with transportation. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is sending 116 members of the National Guard to be stationed on the National Mall. Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said they will be used in support of the D.C. National Guard and the U.S. Capitol Police and “are not there in any law enforcement capacity.” Tennessee said it is sending 1,000 troops that should be on the ground no later than Saturday. Utah is sending approximately 200 National Guard troops. And about 445 Guardsmen left South Carolina on Tuesday afternoon bound for Washington, where the duration of their deployment was undetermined. “When the South Carolina National Guard is activated, we are prepared to respond as long as needed,” Capt. Jessica Donnelly told The Associated Press. ___ Associated Press reporters around the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

We get some good advice.  Guests Melissa Giraud, social justice educator, researcher and advocate. Co-founder of EmbraceRace, an organization that provides resources for parents to teach their children about race. (@RaceEmbrace) Andrew Grant-Thomas, social justice researcher and advocate. Co-founder of EmbraceRace. Former director of programs at the Proteus Fund, a national foundation committed to advancing justice through democracy, human rights, and peace. Deputy director at the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University. (@RaceEmbrace) Christian Cooper, avid bird watcher, comic book writer and biomedical editor for Health Science Communications. New York Audubon Society board member.  Interview Highlights Last week, a video of a white woman calling the police on Christian Cooper, a black birdwatcher in Central Park, went viral. Christian Cooper had asked the white woman, Amy Cooper, to leash her dog. Christian Cooper on how he felt during the confrontation and whether he was scared Christian Cooper: “Any sort of confrontation, of conflict, can be scary. So, yeah, I was scared. I wasn’t overwhelmed by being scared. But, yeah, I was certainly scared. But I think one thing I always try to keep in my head, whenever I’m engaged in any sort of conflict, because there’s always conflict in our society. You don’t want to seek it out, but at the same time, I’m not afraid of it either. You know, there are times when you’re going to have to be in conflict with somebody for various reasons. But the thing I always try to keep in my head is, ‘The person who remains calm wins.’ And that’s what I tried to do in that situation. I just tried to remain calm and just keep doing what I was doing.”  On talking with kids about race For white parents, expose kids to diversity Melissa Giraud: “You start young for one, and you start by exposing your child both, hopefully, in your neighborhood, in your community. … You know, if you’re in a segregated neighborhood, which many of us are, by going out to other communities. To expose them, whether it’s after school or at school, to people who are different from them racially and otherwise. And to make sure that your kids understand that you value difference. And you learn from it. And it’s important to you that they have diverse friends. So maybe you also can model that if it’s possible, again, in your neighborhood, in your part of the country.” On starting the conversation early Melissa Giraud: “It’s multi-factorial. So people often want a recipe and there isn’t a recipe. Like if we knew how to solve structural racism, systemic racism, we would have done it, you know? But we do know that the reason it’s so hard to solve is it’s systemic. And so there are a lot of things to do. So your kid is learning, you know, this cultural soup. They’re learning this stuff from very early. And if we could raise kids in a way that would preempt some of these biases by exposing them to a lot, so they’re not afraid. Also teaching them about injustice. And about their own privilege.”  On Point spoke to Ishmail Abdus-Saboor yesterday about how his family is processing the news of this week. As a black parent of two kids, he knew it was time to talk to them about what was happening blocks away from their home in Philadelphia. Here’s part of that conversation: Ishmail Abdus-Saboor: “I look scared as I was telling him these things. And I could equally see the fear on his face as I was sharing with him. And then, you know, out of nowhere, he asks me, ‘Does that mean we’re going back to being slaves?’ I mean, it wasn’t like slavery was on his mind. It’s not like we just had a conversation about slavery. So the fact that his mind went there and he made that connection, it was startling, jarring and it pierced a sword through my heart.” On how black parents can talk to their kids about race Melissa Giraud: “If your child is in a targeted group, this is something we think about a lot. … And it would depend on the conversations that you’ve had before as well. It’s more likely that black families in particular have spoken about racism and have also done sort of the countercultural work of cultural empowerment, of talking about freedom fighters like Christian. Of people who have resisted, have taken risks, really. Because they don’t know what the outcome will be, but have been able to stand up and to go on birding. You know, Chris has continued with this thing that he loves to do. … I would also say that showing the Floyd video, like we haven’t shown those to our kids. … You really want to not traumatize or re-traumatize kids who are already aware that they’re in some targeted group.” Andrew Grant-Thomas: “It’s important, I think, for kids to know that there are a lot of people who have done the work to get us, you know, to effect the kind of progress that we’ve made. Clearly, there’s a tremendous more amount of work to do. And we have allies in this work and we ourselves can do that work. Whether it’s about educating ourselves, about giving money to the organizations that are doing the work, it’s about giving our time. It’s about how we raise our children. Advocating, you know, being influencers in our own circles, there are a lot of things that we can do.” On the importance of asking questions Melissa Giraud: “Ask questions. … You can start with what they know, or what they think, or what’s their response to the video that Chris made of Amy Cooper. And talk it through.” Andrew Grant-Thomas: “I think we often don’t know, we’re not even aware that children are thinking about these things, making sense. That their sensibilities around race are emerging even very, very young, because we don’t create the space for them to show us. So this point about asking questions to me is largely about giving them the space to tell you, to share with you what they’re thinking again, what sense they’re making, what meaning they’re making. And for you to have an opportunity to share sort of your experiences, your ideas, your questions, and to provide some context, which, you know, as a four-year-old or a five-year-old, they probably don’t have.” On teaching white kids to be allies Christian Cooper: “I think the best thing you could do is teach young white kids to be good allies. To stand up for other people in difficult situations, and that might get us to a better place.”  From The Reading List New York Times: “Chris Cooper Is My Brother. Here’s Why I Posted His Video.” — “I grew up in a family of activists and my parents were teachers. They raised me and my brother, Chris, to never shy from fighting injustice. From police brutality, to the war in Iraq, to climate change, we’ve lifted our voices in protest.” EmbraceRace: “‘How do I make sure I’m not raising the next Amy Cooper?’” — “In our social media age, the figure of the ‘entitled White woman’ who calls the police on people of color, especially Black people, simply for living their lives has become so common that she has become a meme.” The Atlantic: “Becoming a Parent in the Age of Black Lives Matter” — “In a park about half a mile from my home is a wide-open field of grass, whose thin, uneven blades rise up past my ankles. The playground near the park is, like other playgrounds across the country, no longer open, surrounded by the orange-plastic fencing that has become unsettlingly familiar.” Houston Chronicle: “How to talk with your kids about police, race, protests” — “This week, the world witnessed video of former Houston resident George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck in Minneapolis. Floyd’s subsequent death sparked protests nationwide. Watching the tragic events unfold on TV or social media can take an emotional toll on most adults, but what about children?” Chalkbeat Colorado: “‘Moments like now are why we teach’: Educators tackle tough conversations about race and violence — this time virtually” — “Reading about Brown v. Board of Education over Google Meet. Holding one-on-one Zooms with students struggling with their emotions. Planning lessons on criminal justice reform for the fall — both in-person and remote, in case school buildings don’t reopen.” USA Today: “George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. What do we tell our children?” — “Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ‘the talk’ once again.” CNN: “How to talk to your children about protests and racism” — “As cities and social media explode with anger over the killing of yet another black man at the hands of police, worried parents struggle with how to protect their children from seeing the worst of the violence while simultaneously explaining the ravages of racism.” This article was originally published on WBUR.org.

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — Virginia Beach officials put out an early Tuesday morning update about the second night of protests in their city. Protesters took to Town Center Monday evening to decry the death of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody after former officer Derek Chauvin pinned him down by the neck with his knee for nine minutes. As of midnight, officials say no one was hurt and no property was damaged during any of the demonstrations at Town Center. Police did arrest 26 people, but haven't released details on what they've been charged with. This follows a very different scene at the Oceanfront Sunday night where a demonstration quickly descended into mayhem. A small number of people interrupted a peaceful march to set fires, fire guns into shops, smash storefront windows and vandalize other businesses and property lining Atlantic Avenue. Police deescalated the situation by firing tear gas to break up the rioting groups. Police arrested 19 people that night. Leaders of Black Lives Matter 757 said the destruction wasn't at their hands, but the fault of outsiders. They issued a statement on Monday saying they wanted to help Oceanfront businesses recover from any damage they sustained during the Sunday night protests. Nearly 50 businesses and properties were vandalized during the demonstration.

The curfew starts at 8 p.m. and ends at 6 a.m. Officials say about 100 people were still gathered at Town Center after 8 p.m. on Tuesday.

Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. We’re done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. 10:35 p.m. (ET) Beloved former St. Louis police captain killed by looters  For 38 years, Dave Dorn worked to protect and serve the public as a police officer, rising to the rank of captain in the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. Dorn was shot and killed by a looter overnight while working as a security guard at Lee’s Pawn and Jewelry on Martin Luther King Drive, KTVI reports. He was 77. “He was exercising his law enforcement training,” said St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden. “So, in his honor, we are wearing our mourning badge.” After retiring from the St. Louis department in 2007, Dorn became the chief of police in Moline Acres. No matter where Dave Dorn worked, people loved him. Retired St. Louis police Officer David Ellison said Dorn helped him out of poverty and into a life in law enforcement. “Dave Dorn was a great man. He was fair; the sharpest, cleanest guy,” Ellison said. “He came out of the car; his presence was well-known and observed. He meant business when it was time for business.” Chief Hayden said investigators have made no arrests and have not identified a suspect. 10:19 p.m. (ET) New York City HAPPENING NOW: Stand off.

Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. the night before, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard. After some people broke into a Zara on Broadway lots of police arrived, by car, bike, on foot. pic.twitter.com/B2UWZ5hLfR — Jan Ransom (@Jan_Ransom) June 3, 2020 “Everyone, time to go home so we can keep people safe,” he said on WINS-AM radio shortly after the curfew took effect. He was ignored by many around the city who continued marching throughout the city’s streets. In some areas, police let people continue on their way, while making arrests in others. “I’m surprised,” said Risha Munoz, on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where at points they were greeted with cheers and horns by onlookers in building windows. “I didn’t think they were gonna let us go on, but we just kept on moving and we’re not stopping.” In some locations, officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them. “Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change. We hear Cuomo and de Blasio everyday saying what’s happening is unacceptable but with no actionable plan from them.” The police department announced it would not allow vehicle traffic south of 96th Street in Manhattan after curfew, though residents, essential workers, buses and truck deliveries were exempt. “We’re going to have a tough few days. We’re going to beat it back,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said in announcing that the 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew would remain through Sunday. Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. While de Blasio insisted the city would put a stop to the violence and vandalism that have marred largely peaceful mass demonstrations surrounding Floyd’s death, both the Republican president and the Democratic governor laid into the city’s handling of the mayhem thus far. “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. “Look at the videos. It was a disgrace.” He said the mayor was underestimating the problem and the nation’s largest police force wasn’t deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Cuomo’s remarks infuriated the New York Police Department’s highest-ranking uniformed member, Chief of Department Terence Monahan. Officers are “giving their blood to keep this city safe,” he told the New York Post, adding that he’d been hit by a bike and bloodied himself while arresting suspects Monday night. Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi later said the governor “has respect and confidence in the NYPD” and felt the mayor should put more officers on the streets. Unprompted, Cuomo brought up the possibility of using his power as governor to replace the mayor and deploy the National Guard over de Blasio’s objections, then immediately shot down the idea as legally impractical and unnecessary. On Twitter, Trump urged a 7 p.m. curfew and National Guard deployment in his native city. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” he wrote. But de Blasio said the NYPD was “best equipped” to handle the lawbreaking, arguing that bringing in the National Guard risked fueling worse conflict in a city on edge. “We will regret it if we bring outside armed forces,” he said. “When you bring in people not trained for the circumstance but still with loaded weapons and put under horrible stress, really bad things happen.” The mayhem over the last four nights has clearly challenged the 36,000-officer police force, which has a reputation as a muscular, well-resourced agency that has driven down crime and faced down terror threats in the nation’s biggest city. On Monday night and early Tuesday, police again struggled to keep up with, let alone get ahead of, roving groups of people bashing their way into shops, including Macy’s flagship Manhattan store. De Blasio said officials expected problems farther downtown, as had happened the night before, and “adjustments were made” once officials realized that the hot spots had shifted. Nearly 700 people were arrested overnight, and several officers were injured. A sergeant was struck by a hit-and-run driver in the Bronx and was hospitalized in serious but stable condition, police said. Video also showed a group of people hitting a police officer with pieces of wreckage until he pulled his gun and they ran. 7:06 p.m. (ET) Officers taking a knee with protesters in Los Angeles Watch all of this. pic.twitter.com/YHq0QhXrnw — Gadi Schwartz (@GadiNBC) June 2, 2020 Sarasota, Fla.

FILE – This undated file photo provided by Christopher Harris shows George Floyd.

Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights announced the filing of the formal complaint at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. The governor and Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said they hope to reach agreement with the city to identify short-term ways to address the police department’s history of racial discrimination, and use the investigation to find long-term solutions for systemic change. Lucero said their goal is to negotiate a consent decree with the city that courts could enforce with injunctions and financial penalties. There are precedents, she said, including a consent decree approved in Chicago last year after the U.S. Justice Department found a long history of racial bias and excessive use of force by police. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s death has sparked sometimes violent protests around the world. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers involved were fired but have not been charged. “We know that deeply seated issues exist,” the governor said. “And the reason I know it is we saw the casual nature of the erasing of George Floyd’s life and humanity. We also know by the reaction of the community. They expected nothing to happen, and the reason is because nothing did happen for so many times.” Walz said the investigation into the police department’s policies, procedures and practices over the past 10 years will determine if the force has engaged in systemic discrimination toward people of color, and root it out. Lucero will lead the investigation. All 12 members of the Minneapolis City Council endorsed a statement read by Council President Lisa Bender at a news conference later Tuesday in support of the investigation. “We urge the state to use its full weight to hold the Minneapolis Police Department accountable for any and all abuses of power and harms to our community and stand ready to aid in this process as full partners,” the council said. Mayor Jacob Frey said the state’s intervention will help break what he called a stalemate on reform. “For years in Minneapolis, police chiefs and elected officials committed to change have been thwarted by police union protections and laws that severely limit accountability among police departments,” Frey said in a statement. “I welcome today’s announcement because breaking through those persistent barriers, shifting the culture of policing, and addressing systemic racism will require all of us working hand in hand.” A police department spokesman and the president of the officers’ union didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The FBI is also investigating whether police willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights enforces the state’s human rights act, particularly as it applies to discrimination in employment, housing, education, public accommodations and public services. Mediation is one of its first-choice tools, but the cases it files can lead to fuller investigations and sometimes end up in litigation. The Minneapolis Police Department has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African Americans and other minorities, even within the department itself. Critics say its culture resists change, despite the elevation of Medaria Arradondo as its first black police chief in 2017. Arradondo himself was among five black officers who sued the police department in 2007 over alleged discrimination in promotions, pay, and discipline. They said in their lawsuit that the department had a history of tolerating racism and discrimination. The city settled the lawsuit for $740,000. State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, who was neighboring St. Paul’s second black police chief, said good officers should welcome the investigation. He co-chaired a working group with Attorney General Keith Ellison that reported back in February on ways to reduce police-involved deadly force encounters. “I’ve been a cop for 40 years. I have lived in this system that they’re talking about reforming. … The cops I talk to, the cops I’ve worked with since 1977 to date will tell you, they want change,” Harrington said. “They don’t want to work in a flawed system. They don’t want to have to be wearing gas masks. They don’t want to have to be on riot control duty.” Earlier Tuesday, an attorney for Floyd’s family again decried the official autopsy that found his death was caused by cardiac arrest as police restrained him and compressed his neck. The medical examiner also listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use, but not as the cause of death. A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression. “The cause of death was that he was starving for air. It was lack of oxygen. And so everything else is a red herring to try to throw us off,” family attorney Ben Crump said. He said the Hennepin County medical examiner went to great lengths to try to convince the public that what was shown on bystander video didn’t cause Floyd to die. Ellison told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine whether more charges will be filed. 5:28 p.m. (ET) 14th St. in Washington, D.C. 5:13 p.m. (ET) Curfews give sweeping powers to cops, but are often flouted Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional. From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place — in some cases for the first time in decades — sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets. But the deadlines aren’t hard and fast — many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on violent unrest. A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. And curfews can be a deterrent to get law-abiding citizens off the street and allow police to focus their efforts on the unrest and not get bogged down in run-of-the-mill violations. New York City put in place a large-scale curfew for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years this week as groups vandalized buildings and stole from stores. The curfew was originally 11 p.m., but Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled it back to 8 p.m., before the sun goes down. “If you choose to protest today, do it in the daytime hours and then please go home because we have work to do to keep a peaceful city,” de Blasio said. Curfews have been installed in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit, Denver. Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities and communities across the country. Curfews aren’t unusual in the United States but are typically used in natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to allow law enforcement to stop anyone on the streets and prevent stealing when many homes and empty or damaged. New York City has used curfews in specific locations like parks — sometimes with controversial results. The 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot in Manhattan had to do in part with a then-newly imposed 1 a.m. parks department curfew in a bid to rid the park of drugs and crime. In enforcing the curfew, police flooded the park with officers and were accused of rampant abuses. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani ramped up enforcement of Central Park’s nightly closure after a string of robberies in the late 1990s. Giuliani was so strict about the curfew, he wouldn’t grant an exception for a late-night vigil to John Lennon, despite intercession from the lord mayor of Liverpool on behalf of aggrieved Beatles fans. During the unrest of the past week, police also want bystanders off the street during unrest — and the curfew solves that. “The curfew really is to keep people from coming sort of to gawk at what’s going on and keep the looky-loos away,” said Sacramento City Councilman Steve Hansen, whose city’s 8 p.m. Monday curfew appeared to help prevent the destructive demonstrations from the night before. The curfews also come on the heels of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, making for an unprecedented stretch in cities like New York. In Columbia, South Carolina, officials lifted a weekend curfew and the mayor joined an afternoon protest at the state capitol calling for police reform. But several dozen people stayed for hours after the protest ended as tensions with police grew as shadows got longer. Just before 7:30 p.m. Monday, Columbia, South Carolina , Mayor Steve Benjamin set a curfew for 7:45 p.m. for a small area of downtown and an areas of restaurants and shops. The city sent an emergency notice and protesters looked at their screens as their phones started to buzz and the curfew set in. The protesters immediately started to walk away. But some civil rights organizations think hastily issued curfews are unfair and against the First Amendment of the Constitution. “By making presence on public streets anywhere in these cities unlawful, these measures give police too much discretion over whom to arrest,” said the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California after a number of cities issued curfews. New York City on Monday found out an unintended consequence of a curfew is keeping away law-abiding protesters. The night before, they banded together to stop vandalism and help police find lawbreakers. It also sends a subtle message, said New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez. “Implementing a curfew and increasing the number of police officers patrolling the streets is a tactic to effectively silence the voices raised in protest against the abuse of power and looting of black and colored bodies by members of the police,” Rodriguez said. Curfews can cause other problems too. Charleston, South Carolina, had a curfew for three days after late night Saturday protests led to shattered windows for restaurants and businesses and stolen merchandise downtown. Monday night was quiet. And Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said he immediately heard from a certain group of people. “We want to give our businesses a chance to get back into business,” Tecklenburg told his City Council at a Tuesday meeting lifting the curfew. A curfew also allows police to separate people who want to protest while following the law from people who want to cause harm, said Tamara Herold, an assistant professor in the Criminal Justice Department at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. That makes it easier for law enforcement to decide how to use force to break up unrest. “One of the things police always want to avoid is using indiscriminate force against a large crowd,” Herold said. 5:04 p.m. (ET) George W. Bush issues statement on ‘brutal suffocation’ of George Floyd: ‘It is time for us to listen’ Former President George W. Bush issued a statement Tuesday regarding the “brutal suffocation of George Floyd,” saying it is “time for us to listen” and that it is time for America to “examine our tragic failures.” The full statement is below: “Laura and I are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country. Yet we have resisted the urge to speak out, because this is not the time for us to lecture. It is time for us to listen. It is time for America to examine our tragic failures – and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths. It remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country. It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. This tragedy — in a long series of similar tragedies — raises a long overdue question: How do we end systemic racism in our society? The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving. Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place. America’s greatest challenge has long been to unite people of very different backgrounds into a single nation of justice and opportunity. The doctrine and habits of racial superiority, which once nearly split our country, still threaten our Union. The answers to American problems are found by living up to American ideals — to the fundamental truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by God with certain rights. We have often underestimated how radical that quest really is, and how our cherished principles challenge systems of intended or assumed injustice. The heroes of America — from Frederick Douglass, to Harriet Tubman, to Abraham Lincoln, to Martin Luther King, Jr. — are heroes of unity. Their calling has never been for the fainthearted. They often revealed the nation’s disturbing bigotry and exploitation — stains on our character sometimes difficult for the American majority to examine. We can only see the reality of America’s need by seeing it through the eyes of the threatened, oppressed, and disenfranchised. That is exactly where we now stand. Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions. We know that lasting justice will only come by peaceful means. Looting is not liberation, and destruction is not progress. But we also know that lasting peace in our communities requires truly equal justice. The rule of law ultimately depends on the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system. And achieving justice for all is the duty of all. This will require a consistent, courageous, and creative effort. We serve our neighbors best when we try to understand their experience. We love our neighbors as ourselves when we treat them as equals, in both protection and compassion. There is a better way — the way of empathy, and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice. I am confident that together, Americans will choose the better way.” 4:43 p.m. (ET) Barr vows ‘even greater’ law enforcement resources in unrest U.S. law enforcement officials vowed “even greater law enforcement resources and support” in the nation’s capital Tuesday night to respond to protests, as one local county pulled its officers out, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said she never requested help from neighboring jurisdictions to quell demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. She said D.C. officials flatly rejected a proposal floated by the Trump administration to take over the local police department and threatened legal action if they did. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city. “There will be even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region tonight,” Barr said in a statement. “The most basic function of government is to provide security for people to live their lives and exercise their rights, and we will meet that responsibility here in the nation’s capital.” Law enforcement officers, using flash bangs and tear gas, took aggressive action Monday night to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Donald Trump’s walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, which included officers on foot and horseback, Arlington County in Virginia pulled its officers out of the District of Columbia. The County Board issued a statement Monday night saying its officers were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she’s “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was abused “for a photo op.” In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have provided aid to each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in the District on Saturday and Sunday without incident. In a call with governors Monday, Trump and Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The call raised questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. After speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump then walked slowly out of the White House gates, senior aides and security with him, across the park to the landmark St. John’s Church, where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump then stood alone in front of cameras and raised a Bible — and declared, “We have a great country,” he said. “Greatest country in the world.” Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and in D.C. , Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. In addition to the National Guard, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0

Newport News Police Chief Steve Drew hopes protests in his community will remain peaceful demonstrations. Chief Drew said he understands the pain and believes bridging the gap is what will set them a part. That means changing policies, new training exercises and sometimes that means joining the protest.  Newport News police Chief Steve Drew has stepped in to talk with protesters now on several ocassions. Last week at a rally on the peninsula he stepped in to talk, and again Tuesday outside of headquaters 10 On Your Side’s Tamara Scott asked him, why?  “Anything that de-escalates and calms things down, and let me tell you I have no problem pulling officers back. I have no problem with that I think you have to read the situation and circumstances interact and go from there,” he said. Right now he knows it’s what they need to see. “I think they see that it’s not us versus them, it’s here is an issue that we need to have a debate on, and if you’re willing to step out from behind your office, behind your walls, if you’re willing to step out a line of police officers, and into a crowd especially just one person, then it sends a message that I’m putting myself in your hands. I think it shows a willingness to listen,” he said.  He says he hears the pain and frustrations and wants to make a change people can believe. That’s why he often does live ‘Chat with the Chief’ on social media, to further bridge the gap and keep things transparent. “I wish that I could tell you it will never happen here but I can’t, every profession has individuals that probably should not be in that profession.” But he believes it his responsibility to weed those people out at the beginning of the hiring process. “We’re gonna teach them how to use all of this stuff how to drive a car, policies, and procedures but for me, I want to know do they feel about people, communities and youth,” he explained.  He says he is also working on changing how officers hold each other accountable.  “If you see an officer doing something wrong you interject. If I get into an argument with a citizen and a recruit comes up and said ‘Hey Chief, let me talk to this person,’ I’m fine with that,” he said. He is also implemented a new sergeant to officer ratio so they can look out for each other and work on weaknesses that may be overlooked. He’s just hoping to make a standard other departments can learn from in the future. Latest Posts",0.0

The incident, during which officers used stun guns on the pair and pulled them from their vehicle, received national attention after bystanders recorded and posted video to social media. ""I agree with Mayor [Keisha Lance] Bottoms and I agree with our police chief, Erika Shields, when they both have conveyed in so many separate ways that the conduct in this incident — it is not indicative of the way that we treat people in the city of Atlanta,"" Fulton County, Ga., District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters Tuesday. Howard's office has filed charges — mostly assorted aggravated assault and battery counts — against a half-dozen officers involved in the arrest: Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Streeter and Gardner have been fired from the force since Saturday's confrontation, while three others have been placed on desk duty. Howard said the charges are backed up by extensive interviews with the young couple, Taniyah Pilgrim and Messiah Young, as well as video evidence from bystanders and the officers' body camera footage. The district attorney played one such video from a bodycam. During the video, officers on foot confront Pilgrim and Young, who had been passing them in a car. After the two black occupants appear to drive away briefly from the officers, Pilgrim and Young stop — at which point the officers swarm the vehicle. Stun guns are used on both occupants, who are ripped from the car over Pilgrim's screams to stop. Pilgrim was never charged; Young was charged with attempting to elude officers before the charge was dismissed at the request of the mayor, who apologized. ""We just need to see that all officers are held accountable, and that there really is change moving forward within the culture of policing,"" Young said at a news conference. Atlanta and other cities have seen widespread protests over the past week after another video — that of George Floyd's arrest in Minneapolis — catalyzed outrage over violence in policing. Floyd died after Derek Chauvin — who has since been fired from the Minneapolis police and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter — dug a knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Video of the incident involving Pilgrim and Young caused a stir of its own. ""We understand our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" the Atlanta mayor said Sunday, describing the video as ""disturbing on many levels."" ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.""  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In dozens of cities yesterday, large, mostly peaceful demonstrations devolved into chaos. In Nashville, Miami, Seattle and Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, New York and, frankly, too many other places to name, protesters expressed their rage at the death of George Floyd, police brutality and racism. There were violent confrontations with police, and police cracked down, also violently. There were also mass arrests and injuries among demonstrators, journalists and police. At least a dozen major cities declared curfews. Others called on the National Guard, which has been historically used in response to major civil unrest. There were scenes of National Guard marching through some residential neighborhoods, ordering people to stay inside. We go now to Los Angeles, where members of the National Guard were also deployed overnight and a curfew was put in place as a state of emergency was declared. NPR's Nathan Rott is in LA, and he joins us now. Nate, walk us through what happened yesterday. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: So there was a massive peaceful protest that started around noon yesterday. It was in the Fairfax district in west L.A., which is kind of a trendy neighborhood with high-end retail and a big outdoor mall. And people were protesting against police violence, as they are all over the country. They were memorializing George Floyd, the black man who died after being pinned to the ground by Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, by all accounts, it was peaceful, respectful until a little later in the afternoon, when we started seeing reports of police cars being set on fire and just a total breakdown in the situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This often happens at protests, right? When things shift as things go into the night. Do we know what happened? ROTT: Yeah. And that - honestly, that was a little surprising, Lulu. Usually, these, like, shifts do happen at night. And this started in broad daylight in mid-afternoon, which is, I think, very concerning to a lot of the city officials. So, you know, on social media, people were blaming the police for escalating tensions, for responding with tear gas and the sort of militarized riot gear that has become so commonplace around the country. City officials have so far blamed bad eggs in the crowd for setting things off, and that's something we've been hearing in a lot of places - that it's a small group of people who are agitating these situations. Of course, that's now been politicized, even with the U.S. attorney general blaming anarchists and leftists without, you know, providing any proof of that. But it's really hard to say what makes this situations shift. Tensions are obviously very high, so it doesn't take much to spark something. GARCIA-NAVARRO: No, it doesn't. We saw videos of looting and fires in many cities around the country last night. That was also the case in LA, right? ROTT: Yeah. A number of retail stores in that Fairfax area were broken into. Goods were stolen. Some were set on fire. I know firefighters were dealing with those fires throughout the night. That prompted LA's mayor, Eric Garcetti, to announce a citywide curfew, which caught a lot of people off guard because he announced it an hour before it went into effect. But here he is explaining why they did it and alluding to violent protests in 1992 following Rodney King. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: We've seen this before in Los Angeles. When the violence escalates, no one wins. And so everybody has to be responsible for owning this moment. Whether you wear a badge or whether you hold a sign, I'm asking all of Los Angeles to take a deep breath and to step back for a moment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does it seem like the curfew worked briefly? ROTT: Yeah, the crowds started to thin out even before the curfew started. I know in other parts of the state - Sacramento, San Diego - there were large confrontations between crowds and police. I think, you know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Nate Rott in LA. Thank you so much. ROTT: Yeah. Thank you, Lulu.

1623687977,2020-06-02 17:27:00,Pelosi Asks Black Caucus To Come Up With Police Reforms Following Protests,https://www.wmra.org/post/pelosi-asks-black-caucus-come-police-reforms-following-protests,en,False,,144825,wmra.org,http://wmra.org/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has asked the Congressional Black Caucus to lead the process of drafting a legislative response to the protests that have swept the country following the death of George Floyd. House Democrats are sorting through dozens of proposals to address policing issues, including excessive use of force and racial profiling. ""It is time, it is time for us to address the concerns that were being expressed by the protesters,"" Pelosi said at a press event at the Capitol Tuesday. ""This is not a single incident. We know this is a pattern of behavior. and we also know the history that brings us to this sad place."" Democrats hope to calm the increasingly incendiary atmosphere in the country over Floyd's death by finding ways to address the underlying systemic problems enraging protesters in the streets. There is some degree of bipartisan support for reviewing the tactics that led to Floyd's death. Many Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have acknowledged what McConnell called ""egregious wrongs."" McConnell said Tuesday there could be a role for Congress to play here. ""It's certainly something that we need to take a look at,"" McConnell told reporters. ""We'll be talking to our colleagues about what, if anything, is appropriate for us to do in the wake of what's going on."" But the discussion has often become entwined with public outcry over President Trump's handling of the unrest and his threat to use military force to quell protests. Pelosi said Floyd's killing ""happened in broad daylight, it happened for all the world to see. A knee to the neck, not only by the perpetrator of that murder but by three officers observing it."" Congress has often struggled to address policing issues. Many decisions about policing tactics, training and strategies are determined at the state and local level. Pelosi is asking members of the Congressional Black Caucus to sort through the ideas and find legislation that can pass the House where Democrats have enough votes for approval without GOP support. Among the options is a 2015 bill introduced by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that would outlaw the use of chokeholds in policing. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has endorsed that idea. Democrats are hoping to reach an agreement quickly. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters he could call lawmakers back to Washington to vote before their scheduled return on June 30. Hoyer said that he has been in contact with the Congressional Black Caucus over the last four days and that it is considering more than 50 pieces of legislation, including a proposal to end qualified immunity for police officers, or their legal protection shield for certain actions. Democrats also plan to try to force the Senate to go on record condemning Trump for ""ordering federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against Americans who were peaceably protesting"" Monday outside the White House. The resolution, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would also affirm the rights of free assembly and protest while condemning looting. The measure is unlikely to pass as it requires unanimous consent to be approved. Republicans, including McConnell, have largely focused on calling for protests to remain peaceful without directly discussing the conflict at the White House. ""It is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace in our streets and peace in our communities,"" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""We need to unite against these violent rioters who seek only to aggrandize themselves and further damage a nation that needs healing."" Most Senate Republicans declined Tuesday to discuss the tear gas incident at the White House when reporters on Capitol Hill asked them about it. Some avoided the question; others said they didn't see the incident. Those who did speak to reporters mostly focused on condemning violent protests. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has announced a June 16 hearing on police use of force. ""We intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd's death, with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation,"" Graham said in a statement Friday. ",0.0

To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Now to Texas, where protests continue over the police killing of George Floyd. In Houston, the mayor and police chief are joining Floyd's family and tens of thousands of protesters in their march today. And in Austin, Police Chief Brian Manley said he was crushed after his officers shot three people, including a pregnant woman and a 20-year-old black protester who is in critical condition after being shot in the head. NPR's Wade Goodwyn joins us now with more from Dallas. Wade, thanks for joining us. WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: Hello. MARTIN: Well, the reactions of the police to these protests in Texas have really run the gamut - I mean, from cooperation and support in Houston and Fort Worth to confrontation and mass arrests in Dallas. What's... GOODWYN: Yeah, it's... MARTIN: ...Going on? GOODWYN: It's been interesting to watch because the cities' departments have not behaved as one might expect, given their histories. In Houston, Police Chief Art Acevedo has gone out of his way to show protesters that he views them as allies. He goes to the protests. He's repeatedly criticized President Trump on TV. And you know, this is a significant change from historic - from Houston, you know, historically, which has suffered from a reputation for law enforcement kicking blacks and Hispanics around without much of any cause. So it's been unusual. MARTIN: All right. So that's Houston. But then moving to - on to Austin and Dallas, the police response in those cities has been very different, right? GOODWYN: It has. In Austin, three people were shot by police over the weekend by what the Austin Police Department described as, quote, ""less lethal"" ammunition. But there's a photo of a pregnant woman protester lying on the ground. She's reportedly screaming, my baby, my baby. That was posted to Twitter. She and her unborn child seem to be recovering, but it's traumatized Austin. And she was shot in the stomach with pellets. And in Dallas, protesters have been met repeatedly with tear gas and pepper and smoke and mass arrests. And the African American police chief and the black mayor have been largely unapologetic about it. In fact, here's a clip of Police Chief U. Renee Hall from the weekend. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) U RENEE HALL: This police department will not tolerate rogue vandalism. We will not tolerate tearing up our city. MARTIN: Wade, why do you think that there is such a different approach - particularly, like, the contrast between Dallas and Houston? GOODWYN: The chief of police in Dallas seems to see protesters as potential adversaries, and therefore, it's your job to thwart them. You know, she's referred to them as being cagey, changing tactics, people she needs to get intel on. Friday night, protesters were surrounded and trapped in a downtown intersection and then tear-gassed. The chief said it was because of vandalism, but there were, you know, lots of protesters there who said they were gassed without provocation. And Lee Daugherty, who's an organizer with the Democratic Socialists of America, is one of them. He was trapped in that street and gassed. LEE DAUGHERTY: Well, it was chaos, and you had people fleeing. You had people wanting to get out of the area and could not. You know, this is a peaceful protest to demonstrate against a injustice in this country that we've dealt with for too long. And the response from police is tear gas, flash-bangs and brutality. GOODWYN: You know, there was some vandalism Friday night, but that happened closer to midnight, hours after the tear-gassing. The Dallas Morning News estimated it's been 30 years since the police department used tear gas on a mass protest, and now it's twice in the last few days. MARTIN: Well, let's just state the obvious, Wade. Many of the reasons that people have been advocating for more African Americans in policing is because of scenes like this. Is this surprising that this is the chief's response here? GOODWYN: It has surprised me, kind of - you know, especially the tear gas. I get it that protecting property is a priority. But the protesters were trapped by police last night as they crossed a long bridge across the Trinity River. So it doesn't appear this standoff is on the verge of going away. MARTIN: That's NPR's Wade Goodwyn in Dallas. Wade, thanks. GOODWYN: You're quite welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0
1623693665,2020-06-02 18:42:07,Prince William Police Detail their Response to Sudley Road Protest at BOCS Emergency Meeting,http://bristowbeat.com/news/prince-william-police-detail-response-sudley-road-protest-bocs-emergency-meeting/,en,False,"police, demonstrations and riots",396910,bristowbeat.com,http://bristowbeat.com/,"The Supervisors called an Emergency Prince William Board of County Supervisors meeting, Sunday at 4 p.m., to talk with Prince William Police leadership about the “unlawful assembly” Saturday night on Sudley Road in Manassas and the police response. Police responded to a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest that turned unruly and somewhat violent after dark. Police then responded in riot gear and were joined by State Police and other departments. Use of Force Lt. Con. Jarad Phelps said that police forces did use pepper spray, chemical agents and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. Four Prince William and two state officers were injured and one civilian had their foot run over by a vehicle. Police cars were damaged. Later, five stores along Sudley Road were damaged by demonstrators in the crowd. Phelps said he takes full responsibility for the actions of State Police and all departments and said communication could have been better and would have to be improved in the future. There was little time to plan. Officers who held the line, had to use their own discretion when to use force in response to violent protesters. They responded to being pelted with glass bottles or rocks, and repeatedly told people to evacuate the area for everyone’s safety. Phelps said officers said it “multiple, multiple, multiple times.” Once they remained they were committing a misdemeanor. He said the officers did show “great restraint” as they were being pelted with heavy objects. Sequence of Events According to Phelps, the group that met in the early evening at the intersection of Sudley Road and Sudley Manor Drive in Manassas were peaceful. No permit was required as protesters were on public sidewalks and were exercising their right to assembly. Police were present to ensure they did not block traffic on the road and the demonstration remained peaceful. Around 8 p.m. the atmosphere grew heated as protesters were joined by others. The larger crowd became rowdy, directing anger towards police officers on the scene. Around 8:30 p.m., the tone definitely turned, said Phelps. People marched down to Sudley Road, blocking the road to vehicular traffic. Police declared it an “unlawful assembly” and asked people to disperse. Items were thrown at officers. To address this, police closed the road, asked people to avoid the area, and focused on moving traffic and pedestrians out of the area. Meanwhile, people were throwing large rocks at officers and vehicles. Several police vehicles were damaged. At this time, a large group began walking down Sudley Road heading towards I-66. Prince William Police called the State Police to stop them from blocking the interstate. At this point, believing it had turned violent, Prince William Police also called for back up from officers trained to handle these types of civil unrest situations. Police that showed up wearing gear. Phelps said said it was a calculated risk, knowing it would increase tension, but he felt it was necessary to protect people. Around 10 p.m., Smoke could be seen in videos from VDOT’s road cameras. Phelps said they repeated told people they must evacuate the area. Police from other jurisdictions also arrived to help: Fairfax, Haymarket and the City of Manassas. State Police joined Prince William Police holding the line and trying to disperse protesters from the road. Fairfax County Police were stationed on the perimeter near shopping centers and restaurants to protect property. Phelps said it was unfortunate buildings were damaged and he takes full responsibility for that as well. He said first and foremost they focused on lives. Going forward, they will focus on communication, and getting ahead of future events that are planned so they can have a calming presence. Supervisors Discussion Supervisors thanked police for the way they handled the situation and showing restraint. Supervisor Margaret Franklin (D-Woodbridge) said she was disappointed by the way state police reacted. “State police escalated the situation in my opinion by using the chemical agent that they used. I do want to make the distinction between the county police and some other agencies that were out last night,” she said. “Our guys did the best that they could last night. I do have an issue with the way state police have reacted.” Phelps said he would not point fingers at other agencies. “Anything that happened that night is on me.” Franklin added, almost tearing up, that they had a conversation with Phelps and “it has been excellent.” Supervisors asked how they could help. Do police want them to call a curfew? No, Phelps said, calling a curfew would likely add “fuel to the fire.” Tell the community, “Please, please, legally, peacefully.” Occoquan Supervisor Kenny Boddye (D) asked Phelps to make sure other departments adhere to the same culture as the Prince William Police. Phelps agreed. Supervisors agreed Prince William police have a great reputation. Coles Supervisor Yesli Vega, who served as a police officer and sheriff’s deputy, said that while they all feel pain over George Floyd, and people can certainly protest, it is also important that the police maintain law and order. “By no means does that mean we are going to allow our county to burn. You are the authority in our county,” she said to Phelps. “You are going to do what you need to do to make sure you protect law abiding citizens. That is your duty.” Gainesville Supervisor Pete Candland (R) said he was concerned about the damage to businesses in his district. While people’s live are paramount, people’s livelihoods depend upon their businesses. Most of the business owners he said are first generation Americans. Brentsville Supervisor Lawson (R) said her interactions with Prince William Police have always gone smoothly, whereas she had bad experiences with officers elsewhere. But, Boddye said she should not conflate that with the experiences African Americans have with police. Lawson responded that she was talking more about the culture of the PWC police force. Boddye explained she still needs to be mindful of the difference. Neabsco Supervisor Victor Angry (D) said that even though their department has a great culture, there are still some “stubbed toes.” He told a story of how he was once questioned as a “suspicious person.” He said that is something that happens to African Americans and black parents have to have “the talk” with their children. He wants people to know they don’t have to get violent to have their voices heard. The board of county supervisors offers them a forum. “I will go to bat for your guys.” He invited people to come to the chamber for citizen’s time. “You can peacefully rally. (But) this is where magic happens. We’re going to come in and we’re going to change the culture. It is changing. I’m ready to do the work, so let’s go.” State of Emergency [Previously Published] The Prince William County Board of Supervisors also discussed the option to declare a county-wide state of emergency. Supervisors agreed they do not want the Virginia National Guard to come into the county, they already have the assistance of the Virginia State Police, but they would like to access funding if necessary. Lt. Col. Jarad Phelps said there were costs associated with the protest that turned to a “civil unrest” and “unlawful assembly” on Sudley Road in Manassas, Saturday night. They include overtime for officers and damage to police vehicles. Therefore, having a local State of Emergency could be useful for fiscal reasons. Supervisors wanted to make sure that calling a county-wide state of emergency would not increase police presence by calling in the National Guard or conducting things in a matter that could escalate tensions. The county executive would have to call at county state of emergency that would then be approved by the board. The County also could not implement a curfew without the approval of the Governor as per Virginia law. No decision has been made as whether to place the county under a State of Emergency, but County Executive Chris Martino agreed to further look into the matter. It will be added to Tuesday’s agenda, unless a reason arises to act more expediently. Community Meeting A meeting of the Prince William Police Citizen Advisory Board and other involved citizens, led by Reverend Cozy Bailey, husband of Supervisor Andrea Bailey of the Potamac District, proved very fruitful for the community, according to Phelps. However, Republican supervisors said they were unlawfully excluded from the meeting that began at 12:30 p.m. Supervisor Candland said he was not invited even though Saturday’s protest occurred in his district. “This was happening in my location. And I’m more worried about the fact that you were there, and you saw there were more supervisors attending this meeting…That’s an unlawful assembly of the Board of County Supervisors,” he said. “You let that happen, Chair Wheeler…That’s very concerning. I’m extremely concerned about that.” Brentsville Supervisor Jeanine Lawson agreed. Any time more than two supervisors meet, it becomes a public meeting and all need to be invited, she explained. Chair Ann Wheeler said she expected it to be a meeting with herself, Chief Barry Bernard, Lt. Col. Phelps and County Executive Chris Martino. “And I walked in and there was 60 people in the room.” Phelps said he invited the Citizen’s Advisory Board. Some of those invited, invited other “community leaders.” Invitations spread very informally, said Supervisor Angry. He said it was only mentioned to him by a constituent an hour before the meeting started.Once he got there, he realized it was Citizen’s Advisory Board meeting and maybe hewasn’t suppose to be there. However, as however word spread, the result was all of the Democratic supervisors ended up in attendance and none of the Republicans were even made aware of it. Lawson said it is a state code that was violated and once the supervisors saw they were all there, they should have been invited to join. The Chair should know better and so should all of the others. “I would have at least been invited to that.” Phelps said it “was a very healthy discussion.” They wanted to invite community leaders and especially the faith-based community for transparency. Lawson said she was not blaming him. Maybe “overlooked in the fray of everything.” But then she came back to the topic, repeating her frustration. Bristow Beat did not attend the Community Meeting.

(WAVY) — They watched the death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers and they watched the sometimes violent protests from coast to coast.  On Monday, local pastors watched, in shock, as President Trump called in federal troops, cleared peaceful protesters by force, and then staged a photo-op in front of a church. “It seems as though he was using the church and he used the bible as a prop,” said Dr. Keith Jones, President of the Tidewater Metro Baptist Ministers Conference. With turmoil in Washington, to Hampton Roads, and across the country, a different approach in the fight for justice begins this week with Fill the Hill. The rally and peaceful protest Tuesday night at Mt. Trashmore is hosted by the Virginia Beach Interdenominational Minister’s Conference. “We have to speak out on the social injustice that put people in situations where they come to church beaten down and downtrodden,” said spokesperson Dr. James Allen. From the pews to the polls, the Hampton NAACP Wednesday evening will host a rally and voter registration drive at Bethel AME Church. The group says if meaningful change is going to take place, it’s going to take place on the local level first. Gaylene Kanoyton is the local chapter’s president.  “Let’s use our voice and our vote and, yes, hold our elected officials accountable, hold our police departments accountable, and make sure we have a relationship will all of them,” said Kanoyton. Friday, efforts move to downtown Norfolk, just outside city hall where the Tidewater Metro Baptist Ministers Conference will hold “Prayer in the Public Square” with representatives from the Muslim, Jewish and Catholic communities. Conference president, Dr. Jones, is critical of President Trump’s response to protesters while offering prayers for the president. “We pray for the president, we pray for his health, we pray for his future, we pray for his salvation,” said Jones.

At least three states — New York, Virginia and Delaware — have so far rejected the request, with at least one governor citing Trump’s rhetoric about using troops to “dominate” protesters as a reason why. All of those states are led by Democrats. Meanwhile, several other states around the country are sending troops to Washington with more expected in coming days. The Trump administration has asked multiple states to send troops to Washington at the same time as the president derided many governors as “weak” for not using the National Guard more aggressively in their own states. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam rejected a personal appeal from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on Monday to send thousands of the state’s National Guard members to Washington D.C., the governor's office said. Northam said he was concerned that the Trump administration would misuse the troops to escalate tensions. “I am not going to send our men and women in uniform — a very proud National Guard — to Washington for a photo op,” Northam said, referencing an incident Monday when police used tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump has declared himself to be the “president of law and order” and has vowed to deploy the U.S. military to America’s own cities to quell a rise of violent protests, including ransacking stores and burning police cars. Floyd died last week after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across the U.S. The president's critics say Trump is deepening divisions at a time when leadership was crucial to help unify a fractured country. Delaware Gov. John Carney's office said the state did not send troops because Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser did not request “additional assistance,” a reason Northam also cited. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday he was unaware of any request to send New York's Guard to Washington but said he wouldn’t have granted such a request because they are needed at home. Richard Azzopardi, a senior adviser to the governor, said 200 New York National Guard troops were requested and the decision to deny the request was made at an agency level that did not directly involve Cuomo. Trump has been particularly critical of how officials have handled looting and violence in New York City. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart,” Trump tweeted Tuesday. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf was also asked to send troops but said he is is still evaluating the Trump administration's request. “The National Guard currently has significant resources deployed across Pennsylvania. Their current priority is assisting commonwealth municipalities in their response to de-escalate violence and keep our communities safe,” said Wolf spokeswoman Lyndsay Kensinger. Other governors have been more receptive. Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said almost 1,500 guardsmen were coming to Washington on Tuesday from several states and more were expected Wednesday. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said his state's troops were sent “explicitly to protect federal buildings and federal monuments.” Murphy is the only Democratic governor who has sent troops so far. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is sending 116 members of the National Guard to be stationed on the National Mall. Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said they will be used in support of the D.C. National Guard and the U.S. Capitol Police and “are not there in any law enforcement capacity.” Tennessee said it is sending 1,000 troops that should be on the ground no later than Saturday. Utah is sending approximately 200 National Guard troops. And about 445 Guardsmen left South Carolina on Tuesday afternoon bound for Washington, where the duration of their deployment was undetermined. “When the South Carolina National Guard is activated, we are prepared to respond as long as needed,” Capt. Jessica Donnelly told The Associated Press. ___ Associated Press reporters around the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

(Photo: Tayla Cunningham) UPDATE 7:35 A.M. The fourth day of protests in Richmond started out peacefully, but quickly turned into chaos when Richmond Police officers deployed tear gas on a crowd near the Robert E. Lee statue on Monument Avenue. Video shows that tear has was deployed around 7:30 p.m. — Richmond’s curfew starts at 8 p.m. Shortly after 8 p.m., police tweeted that officers were cut off by violent protesters and that the gas was necessary to get them to safety. To our peaceful protestors: We are sorry we had to deploy gas near the Lee Monument. Some RPD officers in that area were cut off by violent protestors. The gas was necessary to get them to safety. — Richmond Police (@RichmondPolice) June 2, 2020 But later at 9:47 p.m., Richmond Police sent out another tweet saying that the tear gas was unwarranted. According to police, the officers were pulled from the field and will be disciplined. Chief Smith just reviewed video of gas being deployed by RPD officers near the Lee Monument and apologizes for this unwarranted action. These officers have been pulled from the field. They will be disciplined because their actions were outside dept protocols and directions given. — Richmond Police (@RichmondPolice) June 2, 2020 Mayor Stoney said on Twitter that he wants to apologize in person to the protesters who were tear-gassed. He is asking them to attend a meeting outside of City Hall today at noon. “Words cannot make this right, and words cannot restore that trust broke this evening,” the Mayor said on Twitter. “Only action. Only action will repair this community. Come to City Hall tomorrow at noon. I want to say sorry. I want to listen.” In response to the tear gassing, Congressman A. Donald E. McEachin said on Twitter, “…There is no excuse or justification for tear gassing a lawful, peaceable protest, a protest about stopping police brutality.” WATCH: Tuesday’s full event outside Richmond City Hall (Warning: Video contains profanity) Reporter Kerri O’Brien also contributed to this report.",0.0

(Christopher Harris via AP, File) Warning: Social media embeds may contain profanity WASHINGTON (AP) — Undeterred by curfews, protesters streamed back into the nation’s streets Tuesday, hours after President Donald Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by George Floyd’s death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for the possibility of more violence, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. We’re done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. 10:35 p.m. (ET) Beloved former St. Louis police captain killed by looters  For 38 years, Dave Dorn worked to protect and serve the public as a police officer, rising to the rank of captain in the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. Dorn was shot and killed by a looter overnight while working as a security guard at Lee’s Pawn and Jewelry on Martin Luther King Drive, KTVI reports. He was 77. “He was exercising his law enforcement training,” said St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden. “So, in his honor, we are wearing our mourning badge.” After retiring from the St. Louis department in 2007, Dorn became the chief of police in Moline Acres. No matter where Dave Dorn worked, people loved him. Retired St. Louis police Officer David Ellison said Dorn helped him out of poverty and into a life in law enforcement. “Dave Dorn was a great man. He was fair; the sharpest, cleanest guy,” Ellison said. “He came out of the car; his presence was well-known and observed. He meant business when it was time for business.” Chief Hayden said investigators have made no arrests and have not identified a suspect. 10:19 p.m. (ET) New York City HAPPENING NOW: Stand off.

Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. the night before, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard.

He was ignored by many around the city who continued marching throughout the city’s streets. In some areas, police let people continue on their way, while making arrests in others. “I’m surprised,” said Risha Munoz, on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where at points they were greeted with cheers and horns by onlookers in building windows. “I didn’t think they were gonna let us go on, but we just kept on moving and we’re not stopping.” In some locations, officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them. “Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change. We hear Cuomo and de Blasio everyday saying what’s happening is unacceptable but with no actionable plan from them.” The police department announced it would not allow vehicle traffic south of 96th Street in Manhattan after curfew, though residents, essential workers, buses and truck deliveries were exempt. “We’re going to have a tough few days. We’re going to beat it back,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said in announcing that the 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew would remain through Sunday. Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. While de Blasio insisted the city would put a stop to the violence and vandalism that have marred largely peaceful mass demonstrations surrounding Floyd’s death, both the Republican president and the Democratic governor laid into the city’s handling of the mayhem thus far. “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. “Look at the videos. It was a disgrace.” He said the mayor was underestimating the problem and the nation’s largest police force wasn’t deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Cuomo’s remarks infuriated the New York Police Department’s highest-ranking uniformed member, Chief of Department Terence Monahan. Officers are “giving their blood to keep this city safe,” he told the New York Post, adding that he’d been hit by a bike and bloodied himself while arresting suspects Monday night. Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi later said the governor “has respect and confidence in the NYPD” and felt the mayor should put more officers on the streets. Unprompted, Cuomo brought up the possibility of using his power as governor to replace the mayor and deploy the National Guard over de Blasio’s objections, then immediately shot down the idea as legally impractical and unnecessary. On Twitter, Trump urged a 7 p.m. curfew and National Guard deployment in his native city. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” he wrote. But de Blasio said the NYPD was “best equipped” to handle the lawbreaking, arguing that bringing in the National Guard risked fueling worse conflict in a city on edge. “We will regret it if we bring outside armed forces,” he said. “When you bring in people not trained for the circumstance but still with loaded weapons and put under horrible stress, really bad things happen.” The mayhem over the last four nights has clearly challenged the 36,000-officer police force, which has a reputation as a muscular, well-resourced agency that has driven down crime and faced down terror threats in the nation’s biggest city. On Monday night and early Tuesday, police again struggled to keep up with, let alone get ahead of, roving groups of people bashing their way into shops, including Macy’s flagship Manhattan store. De Blasio said officials expected problems farther downtown, as had happened the night before, and “adjustments were made” once officials realized that the hot spots had shifted. Nearly 700 people were arrested overnight, and several officers were injured. A sergeant was struck by a hit-and-run driver in the Bronx and was hospitalized in serious but stable condition, police said. Video also showed a group of people hitting a police officer with pieces of wreckage until he pulled his gun and they ran. 7:06 p.m. (ET) Officers taking a knee with protesters in Los Angeles Watch all of this. pic.twitter.com/YHq0QhXrnw — Gadi Schwartz (@GadiNBC) June 2, 2020 Sarasota, Fla.

FILE – This undated file photo provided by Christopher Harris shows George Floyd.

Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights announced the filing of the formal complaint at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. The governor and Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said they hope to reach agreement with the city to identify short-term ways to address the police department’s history of racial discrimination, and use the investigation to find long-term solutions for systemic change. Lucero said their goal is to negotiate a consent decree with the city that courts could enforce with injunctions and financial penalties. There are precedents, she said, including a consent decree approved in Chicago last year after the U.S. Justice Department found a long history of racial bias and excessive use of force by police. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s death has sparked sometimes violent protests around the world. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers involved were fired but have not been charged. “We know that deeply seated issues exist,” the governor said. “And the reason I know it is we saw the casual nature of the erasing of George Floyd’s life and humanity. We also know by the reaction of the community. They expected nothing to happen, and the reason is because nothing did happen for so many times.” Walz said the investigation into the police department’s policies, procedures and practices over the past 10 years will determine if the force has engaged in systemic discrimination toward people of color, and root it out. Lucero will lead the investigation. All 12 members of the Minneapolis City Council endorsed a statement read by Council President Lisa Bender at a news conference later Tuesday in support of the investigation. “We urge the state to use its full weight to hold the Minneapolis Police Department accountable for any and all abuses of power and harms to our community and stand ready to aid in this process as full partners,” the council said. Mayor Jacob Frey said the state’s intervention will help break what he called a stalemate on reform. “For years in Minneapolis, police chiefs and elected officials committed to change have been thwarted by police union protections and laws that severely limit accountability among police departments,” Frey said in a statement. “I welcome today’s announcement because breaking through those persistent barriers, shifting the culture of policing, and addressing systemic racism will require all of us working hand in hand.” A police department spokesman and the president of the officers’ union didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The FBI is also investigating whether police willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights enforces the state’s human rights act, particularly as it applies to discrimination in employment, housing, education, public accommodations and public services. Mediation is one of its first-choice tools, but the cases it files can lead to fuller investigations and sometimes end up in litigation. The Minneapolis Police Department has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African Americans and other minorities, even within the department itself. Critics say its culture resists change, despite the elevation of Medaria Arradondo as its first black police chief in 2017. Arradondo himself was among five black officers who sued the police department in 2007 over alleged discrimination in promotions, pay, and discipline. They said in their lawsuit that the department had a history of tolerating racism and discrimination. The city settled the lawsuit for $740,000. State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, who was neighboring St. Paul’s second black police chief, said good officers should welcome the investigation. He co-chaired a working group with Attorney General Keith Ellison that reported back in February on ways to reduce police-involved deadly force encounters. “I’ve been a cop for 40 years. I have lived in this system that they’re talking about reforming. … The cops I talk to, the cops I’ve worked with since 1977 to date will tell you, they want change,” Harrington said. “They don’t want to work in a flawed system. They don’t want to have to be wearing gas masks. They don’t want to have to be on riot control duty.” Earlier Tuesday, an attorney for Floyd’s family again decried the official autopsy that found his death was caused by cardiac arrest as police restrained him and compressed his neck. The medical examiner also listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use, but not as the cause of death. A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression. “The cause of death was that he was starving for air. It was lack of oxygen. And so everything else is a red herring to try to throw us off,” family attorney Ben Crump said. He said the Hennepin County medical examiner went to great lengths to try to convince the public that what was shown on bystander video didn’t cause Floyd to die. Ellison told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine whether more charges will be filed. 5:28 p.m. (ET) 14th St. in Washington, D.C. 5:13 p.m. (ET) Curfews give sweeping powers to cops, but are often flouted Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional. From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place — in some cases for the first time in decades — sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets. But the deadlines aren’t hard and fast — many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on violent unrest. A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. And curfews can be a deterrent to get law-abiding citizens off the street and allow police to focus their efforts on the unrest and not get bogged down in run-of-the-mill violations. New York City put in place a large-scale curfew for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years this week as groups vandalized buildings and stole from stores. The curfew was originally 11 p.m., but Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled it back to 8 p.m., before the sun goes down. “If you choose to protest today, do it in the daytime hours and then please go home because we have work to do to keep a peaceful city,” de Blasio said. Curfews have been installed in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit, Denver. Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities and communities across the country. Curfews aren’t unusual in the United States but are typically used in natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to allow law enforcement to stop anyone on the streets and prevent stealing when many homes and empty or damaged. New York City has used curfews in specific locations like parks — sometimes with controversial results. The 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot in Manhattan had to do in part with a then-newly imposed 1 a.m. parks department curfew in a bid to rid the park of drugs and crime. In enforcing the curfew, police flooded the park with officers and were accused of rampant abuses. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani ramped up enforcement of Central Park’s nightly closure after a string of robberies in the late 1990s. Giuliani was so strict about the curfew, he wouldn’t grant an exception for a late-night vigil to John Lennon, despite intercession from the lord mayor of Liverpool on behalf of aggrieved Beatles fans. During the unrest of the past week, police also want bystanders off the street during unrest — and the curfew solves that. “The curfew really is to keep people from coming sort of to gawk at what’s going on and keep the looky-loos away,” said Sacramento City Councilman Steve Hansen, whose city’s 8 p.m. Monday curfew appeared to help prevent the destructive demonstrations from the night before. The curfews also come on the heels of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, making for an unprecedented stretch in cities like New York. In Columbia, South Carolina, officials lifted a weekend curfew and the mayor joined an afternoon protest at the state capitol calling for police reform. But several dozen people stayed for hours after the protest ended as tensions with police grew as shadows got longer. Just before 7:30 p.m. Monday, Columbia, South Carolina , Mayor Steve Benjamin set a curfew for 7:45 p.m. for a small area of downtown and an areas of restaurants and shops. The city sent an emergency notice and protesters looked at their screens as their phones started to buzz and the curfew set in. The protesters immediately started to walk away. But some civil rights organizations think hastily issued curfews are unfair and against the First Amendment of the Constitution. “By making presence on public streets anywhere in these cities unlawful, these measures give police too much discretion over whom to arrest,” said the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California after a number of cities issued curfews. New York City on Monday found out an unintended consequence of a curfew is keeping away law-abiding protesters. The night before, they banded together to stop vandalism and help police find lawbreakers. It also sends a subtle message, said New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez. “Implementing a curfew and increasing the number of police officers patrolling the streets is a tactic to effectively silence the voices raised in protest against the abuse of power and looting of black and colored bodies by members of the police,” Rodriguez said. Curfews can cause other problems too. Charleston, South Carolina, had a curfew for three days after late night Saturday protests led to shattered windows for restaurants and businesses and stolen merchandise downtown. Monday night was quiet. And Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said he immediately heard from a certain group of people. “We want to give our businesses a chance to get back into business,” Tecklenburg told his City Council at a Tuesday meeting lifting the curfew. A curfew also allows police to separate people who want to protest while following the law from people who want to cause harm, said Tamara Herold, an assistant professor in the Criminal Justice Department at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. That makes it easier for law enforcement to decide how to use force to break up unrest. “One of the things police always want to avoid is using indiscriminate force against a large crowd,” Herold said. 5:04 p.m. (ET) George W. Bush issues statement on ‘brutal suffocation’ of George Floyd: ‘It is time for us to listen’ Former President George W. Bush issued a statement Tuesday regarding the “brutal suffocation of George Floyd,” saying it is “time for us to listen” and that it is time for America to “examine our tragic failures.” The full statement is below: “Laura and I are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country. Yet we have resisted the urge to speak out, because this is not the time for us to lecture. It is time for us to listen. It is time for America to examine our tragic failures – and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths. It remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country. It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. This tragedy — in a long series of similar tragedies — raises a long overdue question: How do we end systemic racism in our society? The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving. Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place. America’s greatest challenge has long been to unite people of very different backgrounds into a single nation of justice and opportunity. The doctrine and habits of racial superiority, which once nearly split our country, still threaten our Union. The answers to American problems are found by living up to American ideals — to the fundamental truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by God with certain rights. We have often underestimated how radical that quest really is, and how our cherished principles challenge systems of intended or assumed injustice. The heroes of America — from Frederick Douglass, to Harriet Tubman, to Abraham Lincoln, to Martin Luther King, Jr. — are heroes of unity. Their calling has never been for the fainthearted. They often revealed the nation’s disturbing bigotry and exploitation — stains on our character sometimes difficult for the American majority to examine. We can only see the reality of America’s need by seeing it through the eyes of the threatened, oppressed, and disenfranchised. That is exactly where we now stand. Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions. We know that lasting justice will only come by peaceful means. Looting is not liberation, and destruction is not progress. But we also know that lasting peace in our communities requires truly equal justice. The rule of law ultimately depends on the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system. And achieving justice for all is the duty of all. This will require a consistent, courageous, and creative effort. We serve our neighbors best when we try to understand their experience. We love our neighbors as ourselves when we treat them as equals, in both protection and compassion. There is a better way — the way of empathy, and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice. I am confident that together, Americans will choose the better way.” 4:43 p.m. (ET) Barr vows ‘even greater’ law enforcement resources in unrest U.S. law enforcement officials vowed “even greater law enforcement resources and support” in the nation’s capital Tuesday night to respond to protests, as one local county pulled its officers out, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said she never requested help from neighboring jurisdictions to quell demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. She said D.C. officials flatly rejected a proposal floated by the Trump administration to take over the local police department and threatened legal action if they did. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city. “There will be even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region tonight,” Barr said in a statement. “The most basic function of government is to provide security for people to live their lives and exercise their rights, and we will meet that responsibility here in the nation’s capital.” Law enforcement officers, using flash bangs and tear gas, took aggressive action Monday night to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Donald Trump’s walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, which included officers on foot and horseback, Arlington County in Virginia pulled its officers out of the District of Columbia. The County Board issued a statement Monday night saying its officers were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she’s “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was abused “for a photo op.” In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have provided aid to each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in the District on Saturday and Sunday without incident. In a call with governors Monday, Trump and Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The call raised questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. After speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump then walked slowly out of the White House gates, senior aides and security with him, across the park to the landmark St. John’s Church, where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump then stood alone in front of cameras and raised a Bible — and declared, “We have a great country,” he said. “Greatest country in the world.” Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and in D.C. , Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. In addition to the National Guard, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0

Wallace, AP) RICHMOND — An angry crowd shouted down Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney Tuesday after police lobbed tear gas at a group of peaceful demonstrators during a protest over the death of George Floyd. Several hundred people gathered outside City Hall, chanted ""Fire them!"" and repeatedly drowned out Stoney as he apologized and promised that the officers involved will face disciplinary action. ""Where were you last night when we were being tear gassed?"" a woman yelled as Stoney tried to speak. ""Where were you? Where were you? Where were you?"" the crowd chanted. Stoney told the crowd he would commit that it would never happen again. ""I will watch with you, I will stand with you, I will be with you,"" he said. Some in the crowd called for the firing of the police officers who used tear gas. Others called on Stoney and police Chief William Smith to resign.

Robert E. Lee. Police guard Robert E. Lee Statue in Richmond, Va., Monday. (Photo: Daniel Sangjib Min, AP) Clouds of white gas surrounded demonstrators as they scattered, and one video appeared to show an officer chasing and spraying a protester. ""Every peaceful protester should be allowed to protest, that is your right. That's the bottom line, and we violated that,"" Stoney told the crowd. Smith also apologized and also took a knee briefly after being invited to do so by a woman in the crowd.

The meeting, which lasted over an hour, ended when Stoney and Smith walked back inside City Hall. Stoney agreed to march with the protesters Tuesday evening. The tear gas was used on a group of protesters gathered near the Lee statue during the fourth night of protests over the killing of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes as he pleaded for air. The officer has been charged with murder. The Richmond Police Department initially defended its use of tear gas shortly before an 8 p.m. curfew, tweeting that some officers ""were cut off by violent protesters"" and the tear gas ""was necessary to get them to safety."" About two hours later, the department retreated from that position after Smith reviewed video of the incident. In a tweet, the department apologized ""for this unwarranted action."" The tweet said the officers who used the tear gas ""have been pulled from the field"" and will be disciplined ""because their actions were outside dept protocols and directions given.""

The police department did not say how many officers were involved or what kind of discipline they face. Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington, said the incident could damage Stoney politically. The Democrat is widely seen as a potential candidate for governor in 2021. ""Mayor Stoney had a much brighter political future 48 hours ago,"" Farnsworth said. ""The challenge for the mayor going forward is to restore confidence in his leadership of Richmond that has been undermined by developments this week."" Farnsworth said Stoney's decision to meet with angry protesters was a ""painful, but necessary"" step. ""Obviously, it would have been better if things had gone down differently on Monday, but given what happened, the mayor is wise to make aggressive efforts at trying to limit the damage to the community,"" he said.

When worn, masks were put on when walking inside the store and then removed once customers left. Calello was not able to find any standing signs that recommended or required customers to wear masks inside the store. There are multiple entrances and all are used for entering and exiting the store, with the exception of the garden center. While the Lowe's in Waynesboro is smaller and less crowded than the store in Staunton, there were still some employees and customers either without masks or not wearing them properly. However, some employees were wearing them properly and kept them on at all times. There also seemed to be a lack of awareness about social distancing. This could be due to the interior space being larger than most stores. There are standing signs indicating where to stand when checking out inside the garden center, but some of the customers who were in this line did not have masks on at all. Buy Photo PHOTOS: Lowe's in Waynesboro — observations of masks worn and social distancing (Photo: Monique Calello/The News Leader) Surprise observations: Employees were wearing their masks below their noses and mouths. Some were not wearing them at all. Both employees and customers were removing their masks to talk on their cellphones, and employees were pushing their masks down below their chins to talk to each other. Customers were not wearing masks. Some were not paying attention to others while without any face coverings to protect themselves or the people around them. Based on observation, there doesn't seem to be employee guidelines for how to wear masks at Lowe's in Waynesboro. Vendors making deliveries outside the store were not wearing masks. Curbside pickup customers were not wearing masks. The atmosphere seemed relaxed and the store was not crowded. Those wearing masks did not appear to mind the people who were not.

But the marchers couldn't be silenced. After walking from Gypsy Hill Park to the Augusta County Courthouse without saying a word, the protesters began chanting ""Black Lives Matter,"" and ""Say his name, George Floyd,"" on the return trip to the park.

The speculation was being raised by conservative news outlets and pro-Trump social media accounts, as well as impostor Facebook and Twitter accounts. Twitter and Facebook busted some of the instigators behind the unsubstantiated social media chatter. Twitter determined Monday that a tweet promising antifa would “move into residential areas” and “white” neighborhoods was sent by the white supremacy group Identity Evropa. The tweet was shared hundreds of times and cited in online news articles before Twitter removed it Monday, a company spokesperson said. Yet the tweet continued to circulate Tuesday on Facebook and Instagram. Facebook, using information shared by Twitter, announced Tuesday night it also took down a handful of accounts on its platform that were created by white supremacy groups like Identity Evropa and American Guard, some of them posing as part of the antifa movement. For years, some social media users have tried to delegitimize controversial or political protests with baseless theories that they were organized by wealthy financiers or extremists organizations. Over the weekend, Trump singled out antifa as being responsible for the violent protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd, saying in a tweet: “It’s ANTIFA and the Radical Left.” “Usually you see this when there’s an interest to deflect conversations from protests to just accusing the protests of being violent, organized or having backers that are evil,”said Filippo Menczer, a professor of informatics and computer science at Indiana University. “The president mentioning it, of course, has generated a huge spike.” The theories about antifa — short for “anti-fascists” and an umbrella term for lefitst militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations — have trickled through cities across the country in recent days. Police departments say people are phoning in “tips” they see on social media claiming antifa is sending buses or even planes full of antifa activists to their area. In Payette County, Idaho — a rural county of 24,000 — the calls started early Monday morning after one Facebook user said the sheriff had spotted antifa rioters in the area. The calls didn’t taper off until the sheriff’s office debunked the rumor on Facebook. “It’s really a small community, where our citizens know us pretty well,” said Payette County Sheriff Lt. Andy Creech. “When the post got out there, we started getting phone calls directly.” Meanwhile, Facebook users were also warning their friends to stay clear of a shopping center in a New Jersey suburb, saying it would be the center of antifa destruction on Tuesday. But police had “no credible information” that antifa would be present in the area, Toms River Police Department media specialist Jillian Messina said in an email. The police aren’t aware of anyone showing up at all, she added. Identical Facebook and Twitter posts about busloads of antifa protesters also stumped the Sioux Falls Police Department, where officers in the South Dakota city said they didn’t see any unusual bus activity in town. But the claims still spread for days ahead of a planned protest this Saturday, said Sam Clemens, a public information officer for the department. “Everyone heard there were going to be buses of people,” Clemens said. “It was very specific: there were three busloads.” Even the owner of a Michigan limousine business was forced to refute online rumors when two of his buses became the center of a conspiracy theory that liberal financier George Soros was funneling protesters to Milan, Michigan. Social media users widely shared a manipulated photo of his white buses, edited to show the words “Soros Riot Dance squad” emblazoned on the sides. The buses belong to Sean Duval, the owner of local transportation company Golden Limousine International, and don’t have any words printed on them. Said Duval: “It’s frustrating when people from the outside start instigating and try to turn American against American.” ___ Associated Press writers Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, Calif., Beatrice Dupuy in New York and Ali Swenson in Seattle contributed to this report.",0.0

As protesters march side by side, they risked spreading and contracting the virus that can now infect thousands of households. COVID-19 testing sites may also not be accessible, limiting diagnoses of the deadly disease. Marchers, some not wearing masks, can be seen chanting, and in some cases screaming, during protests and demonstrations this week. “When people are yelling or speaking in a loud voice, you do have more projection of saliva. And with that, potentially (the) virus,” Chicago Public Health Department’s Dr. Allison Arwady said. Packed-in, moving crowds also do not allow protesters to stay a safe distance away from each other. “One of the reasons we always make that 6-foot recommendation and have the cloth face covering recommendation, is those are the two best ways to prevent transmission,” Arwady said. Now, before mass infections spread, health experts and officials in cities like Chicago are urging anyone who participated in the protest to self isolate. “Please, in exercising your First Amendment rights, or if you were out for any other reason, you have now put yourself at risk and we need you to isolate yourself,” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. “We need you to think about, and be conscious of, whether you are experiencing any signs or symptoms.” “My worry is that we’ve already seen this so disproportionately impact black and brown communities in Chicago,” Arwady said. “What I want is for all of us, especially those communities, is to get on the other side of COVID here. And so if people can do these things that help keep themselves safe, help keep their close contacts safe, it’s in the best interest of them and then really the whole city.” Protesters are urged to stay far away from their family member in high coronavirus risk due to diabetes, heart disease, asthma, age or obesity. “I really want people to recognize that over these next 14 days … I don’t want you in close contact with people who have those underlying conditions or people who are over 60 because you have a higher potential than you did previously to spread it,” Arwady said. “Nothing has changed about COVID and the problem is the virus doesn’t care what else is going on. The virus is just looking for opportunities to spread.” Testing in Chicago was halted Monday – even for people with symptoms – as the Illinois Department of public health was concerned about staff and potential patient safety. However, the city of Chicago has plenty of testing sites through hospitals and clinics.

(AP) "" Some governors are rejecting President Donald Trump's request to send National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., for a massive militarized show of force in the nation's capital after several days of unrest over the death of George Floyd. Several states, including New York and Virginia, have so far rejected the request, with at least one governor citing Trump's rhetoric about using troops to 'dominate' protesters as a reason why. All of those states are led by Democrats. Meanwhile, several other states around the country are sending troops to Washington with more expected in coming days. The Trump administration has asked multiple states to send troops to Washington at the same time as the president derided many governors as 'weak' for not using the National Guard more aggressively in their own states. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam rejected a personal appeal from Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on Monday to send thousands of the state's National Guard members to Washington D.C., the governor's office said. Northam said he was concerned that the Trump administration would misuse the troops to escalate tensions. 'I am not going to send our men and women in uniform "" a very proud National Guard "" to Washington for a photo op,' Northam said, referencing an incident Monday when police used tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump has declared himself to be the 'president of law and order' and has vowed to deploy the U.S. military to America's own cities to quell a rise of violent protests, including ransacking stores and burning police cars. Floyd died last week after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across the U.S. The president's critics say Trump is deepening divisions at a time when leadership was crucial to help unify a fractured country. Delaware Gov. John Carney's office said the state did not send troops because Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser did not request 'additional assistance,' a reason Northam also cited. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday he was unaware of any request to send New York's Guard to Washington but said he wouldn't have granted such a request because they are needed at home. Richard Azzopardi, a senior adviser to the governor, said 200 New York National Guard troops were requested and the decision to deny the request was made at an agency level that did not directly involve Cuomo. Trump has been particularly critical of how officials have handled looting and violence in New York City. 'NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart,' Trump tweeted Tuesday. Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker declined to dispatch any National Guard members to Washington, while Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said he is still evaluating the Trump administration's request. Other governors have been more receptive. Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said almost 1,500 guardsmen were coming to Washington on Tuesday from several states and more were expected Wednesday. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said his state's troops were sent 'explicitly to protect federal buildings and federal monuments.' Murphy is the only Democratic governor who has sent troops so far. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, also a Democrat, said the Connecticut Air National Guard may provide help with transportation. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is sending 116 members of the National Guard to be stationed on the National Mall. Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said they will be used in support of the D.C. National Guard and the U.S. Capitol Police and 'are not there in any law enforcement capacity.' Tennessee said it is sending 1,000 troops that should be on the ground no later than Saturday. Utah is sending approximately 200 National Guard troops. And about 445 Guardsmen left South Carolina on Tuesday afternoon bound for Washington, where the duration of their deployment was undetermined. 'When the South Carolina National Guard is activated, we are prepared to respond as long as needed,' Capt. Jessica Donnelly told The Associated Press. ___ Associated Press reporters around the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

Trudeau has long been careful not to criticize Trump as Canada relies on the U.S. for 75 percent of exports. But Trudeau, who is usually quick to answer, paused and struggled to come up with the right words when asked about Trump calling for military action against protesters and the use of tear gas for a photo opportunity. The prime minister avoided mentioning Trump directly. 'We all watch in horror and consternation at what is going on the United States,' he said. 'It is time to pull people together.' Police violently broke up a peaceful and legal protest by several thousand people in Lafayette Park across from the White House ahead of a speech in the Rose Garden by Trump on Monday. The protesters had gathered following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week earlier. Afterward, Trump strolled out of the White House gates and walked across the cleared Lafayette Park to make a surprise visit to St. John's Church. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, raised a Bible. He didn't mention Floyd, the church or the peaceful protesters police had just cleared away. In the same question Trudeau was also asked what message he is sending if he he didn't comment about Trump's actions. 'Clearly, Trudeau was not expecting this pointed question. I think he was considering whether to respond at all, which could have been taken to mean he was not going to criticize Trump,"" said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. 'His comments are a criticism of Trump without naming Trump,' he said. Wiseman said Trudeau was wise not to mention Trump directly. 'Trudeau is smart enough to know that. Trump has shown that he can blow a fuse even if he isn't mentioned directly, as happened at the end of the G7,' Wiseman said. Trump vowed to make Canada pay after Trudeau said he wouldn't be bullied in trade talks at the conclusion of the G7 meeting in Quebec in 2018. Trump called Trudeau 'weak' and 'dishonest.' He threatened tariffs on cars and slapped them on steel.",0.0

The speculation was being raised by conservative news outlets and pro-Trump social media accounts, as well as impostor Facebook and Twitter accounts. Twitter and Facebook busted some of the instigators behind the unsubstantiated social media chatter. Twitter determined Monday that a tweet promising antifa would 'move into residential areas' and 'white' neighborhoods was sent by the white supremacy group Identity Evropa. The tweet was shared hundreds of times and cited in online news articles before Twitter removed it Monday, a company spokesperson said. Yet the tweet continued to circulate Tuesday on Facebook and Instagram. Facebook, using information shared by Twitter, announced Tuesday night it also took down a handful of accounts on its platform that were created by white supremacy groups like Identity Evropa and American Guard, some of them posing as part of the antifa movement. For years, some social media users have tried to delegitimize controversial or political protests with baseless theories that they were organized by wealthy financiers or extremists organizations. Over the weekend, Trump singled out antifa as being responsible for the violent protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd, saying in a tweet: 'It's ANTIFA and the Radical Left.' 'Usually you see this when there's an interest to deflect conversations from protests to just accusing the protests of being violent, organized or having backers that are evil,'said Filippo Menczer, a professor of informatics and computer science at Indiana University. 'The president mentioning it, of course, has generated a huge spike.' The theories about antifa "" short for 'anti-fascists' and an umbrella term for lefitst militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations "" have trickled through cities across the country in recent days. Police departments say people are phoning in 'tips' they see on social media claiming antifa is sending buses or even planes full of antifa activists to their area. In Payette County, Idaho "" a rural county of 24,000 "" the calls started early Monday morning after one Facebook user said the sheriff had spotted antifa rioters in the area. The calls didn't taper off until the sheriff's office debunked the rumor on Facebook. 'It's really a small community, where our citizens know us pretty well,' said Payette County Sheriff Lt. Andy Creech. 'When the post got out there, we started getting phone calls directly.' Meanwhile, Facebook users were also warning their friends to stay clear of a shopping center in a New Jersey suburb, saying it would be the center of antifa destruction on Tuesday. But police had 'no credible information' that antifa would be present in the area, Toms River Police Department media specialist Jillian Messina said in an email. The police aren't aware of anyone showing up at all, she added. Identical Facebook and Twitter posts about busloads of antifa protesters also stumped the Sioux Falls Police Department, where officers in the South Dakota city said they didn't see any unusual bus activity in town. But the claims still spread for days ahead of a planned protest this Saturday, said Sam Clemens, a public information officer for the department. 'Everyone heard there were going to be buses of people,' Clemens said. 'It was very specific: there were three busloads.' Even the owner of a Michigan limousine business was forced to refute online rumors when two of his buses became the center of a conspiracy theory that liberal financier George Soros was funneling protesters to Milan, Michigan. Social media users widely shared a manipulated photo of his white buses, edited to show the words 'Soros Riot Dance squad' emblazoned on the sides. The buses belong to Sean Duval, the owner of local transportation company Golden Limousine International, and don't have any words printed on them. Said Duval: 'It's frustrating when people from the outside start instigating and try to turn American against American.' ___ Associated Press writers Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, Calif., Beatrice Dupuy in New York and Ali Swenson in Seattle contributed to this report.",0.0

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. The large crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for helping spread the coronavirus pandemic at a time when overall deaths are on the decline nationwide and much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The previous day's protests also started calmly, but many descended into violence later in the day. CNN reporter: This looks like a war zone CNN reporter Kyung Lah likened a prominent shopping area in Los Angeles to a war zone as protesters laid waste to the area as part of a protes… — In Washington, the D.C. National Guard was called in as hundreds converged on the mall and pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests. Outside the White House, crowds chanted, taunted Secret Service agents and at times pushed against security barriers, and police used pepper spray. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. — In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. — In the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city's thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. — In Seattle, police fired tear gas and stun grenades to try to disperse black-clad crowds that smashed downtown shopfronts, stole merchandise and tossed mannequins onto the street. — In Los Angeles, protesters chanted ""Black Lives Matter,"" some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. One man used a skateboard to try to break a police SUV's windshield. A spray-painted police car burned in the street. — And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects, knocking several people to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. Here are more stories and videos: ""Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,"" said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan's Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. ""This is the only way we're going to be heard."" Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, 29-year-old Sam Allkija said the damage seen in recent days reflects longstanding frustration and rage in the black community. ""I don't condone them,"" he said. ""But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening."" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who said local forces had been overmatched Friday, fully mobilized the state's National Guard and promised a massive show of force. The Guard announced Saturday it had more than 4,000 members responding to Minneapolis and would quickly have nearly 11,000. ""The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,"" Walz said. ""It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities."" Protester's message for looters: Something is wrong with you One protester in Minneapolis said individuals looting during the nationwide protests, in response to the killing of George Floyd, are 'opportu… Soon after the city's 8 p.m. curfew went into force, lines of police cars and officers in riot gear moved in to confront protesters, firing tear gas to push away throngs of people milling around the city's 5th police precinct station. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not forcefully enough confronting days of violent and damaging protests that included protesters burning down a police station shortly after officers abandoned it. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, ranging from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People were also told to be off the streets of Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle and Minneapolis — where thousands had ignored the same order Friday night. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an ""invisible enemy."" The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

This is the third night groups have protested in the Hill City. Sunday and Monday groups gathered in parts of the city where the protest turned violent. With signs in hand on Tuesday, protester Kylah Kemper Clator and several others wanted Liberty University to know they don’t agree with a recent tweet by the school’s president, Jerry Falwell Jr. Falwell said he would only wear a mask if it was adorned with the controversial blackface photo from Governor Ralph Northam’s medical school yearbook page. “Falwell thought it was OK to post a mask with blackface on it. If he didn’t want to wear a mask, he could’ve just said that,” Clator said. The cause grew bigger to also show concern in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in Minnesota. Liberty University officers came down to join some of the protesters, express empathy and even pray with them. Once night fell, the group took their fight up the road to Campbell County where there was no curfew. The group marched up and down Route 29 until they found a central place to stay. Marquie Scott let the group gather on his lawn. “This is actually our free rights. This is what we should be able to do as Americans out here. There’s absolutely nothing wrong. I have children, interracial kids myself. I stand up for all of this,” Scott said. The group called it a night with plans to continue the cause another day. “We gotta continue to be heard. We can’t expect any changes we talk about it for a little bit. We got to keep being heard we got to keep going,” Clator said. Lynchburg police reopened Wards Road after several hours.",0.0

(Christopher Harris via AP, File) HAMPTON ROADS, Va. (WAVY) — Protests are continuing across the country in the wake of the deaths of several black Americans, including George Floyd in Minneapolis, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and Breonna Taylor in Louisville. Here are some statements released by agencies and officials in Hampton Roads and Eastern Virginia: Newport News Shipbuilding President Jennifer Boykin Since becoming president of Newport News Shipbuilding, I made a promise to communicate with you in a timely and transparent way, and to not shy away from addressing tough issues as they arise. Many of you, rightfully so, have been surprised by my silence this week when there is so much civil unrest happening across our nation with clear impact in our own local community. As I’ve watched recent events unfold across America, I’ve struggled with the right words to express my sadness as a human being, as an American, and as your leader. What’s happening today isn’t just a story on the national news. It is something that affects us all and shapes our perspectives. While I will never have the answers or a simple solution to the pain so many people feel right now, I want to make it abundantly clear that Newport News Shipbuilding values respect, diversity and civility in every way. Our shipyard is a small city – 25,000 strong. And we are a melting pot of diversity. For 134 years, shipbuilders from different cultural, racial and ethnic backgrounds have come together for a shared purpose: to build the greatest ships in the world. But our ships alone do not define us. Our people, who continue to build great ships, define who we are. My message today is about humanity. As we continue to grapple with the conflicts our country is facing, let’s compassionately and constructively, respectfully and civilly, share our personal stories, perspectives and concerns. Listen to one another with an open mind, and treat each other as we want to be treated. It is through shared compassion, respect and empathy that we build a culture of mutual trust and mutual respect where all feel safe to speak up. This is fundamental to our future as a society and as a business. Our strength is our diversity, and our resolve is needed now more than ever. Know that you are coming to work at a company that values fairness, respect and equal treatment for all. I ask for your help to continue building a culture of inclusion where treating each other with respect, dignity and compassion is the norm. If you’re struggling, know that you are not alone. If you or anyone on your team needs to talk, please speak up to your leadership. And remember, we have the HERO program (hiihero.com using access code Huntington Ingalls) as a resource for those who want additional support. City of Williamsburg Statement The Williamsburg City Council and City staff, like most across the country and the world, were shocked and appalled at the events surrounding the tragic death of George Floyd at the hands of those sworn to protect him. Sadly, we fully acknowledge that this is not an isolated incident; rather, it is one more in a seemingly ongoing stream of incomprehensible examples of excessive, unwarranted, force delivered disproportionately upon people of color. Furthermore, we condemn the injustices in the tragic circumstances surrounding his death, as well as those of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. We also recognize that similar situations most likely occur outside of the realm of public awareness and scrutiny, so the problem is undoubtedly far more widespread than any of us can know. We are a small City and do not have a large voice in the national conversation concerning fair treatment, but we have a civic duty, a moral obligation, and a commitment to do our part. In Williamsburg, because of our focus on the lessons of history, we understand and recognize the origins of the painful legacy of our past as it relates to centuries of abhorrent enslavement and the subsequent generations of pervasive inequity and disadvantage faced by so many. Acknowledging that stain and coming to grips with its impact can help us better see a path forward. We also want to reaffirm for each and every member of our community our respect for you as individuals and our value of you as friends and neighbors. Our primary goal is to look out for your health, safety, and welfare, regardless of who you are Real questions must be asked about what our nation stands for, and then what we as organizations and individuals can do to uphold that. We cannot afford to tolerate or turn a blind eye to these senseless acts of violence and discrimination. Similarly, we must also fight against the less obvious, but no less insidious, behaviors that passively persecute others. Recent events reinforce the urgency for us, as a City Council and a City Government, to recommit to our core values and mission. We must stand up, stand firm, and stand together to embrace diversity. In no way can we accept or allow the subjugation of any group. If we fail to defend the defenseless, we become complicit in the act of abuse. Consequently, we are committed to breaking down the walls that divide us and looking for opportunities for mutual enrichment and strengthening by coming together. One overarching point is clear—our society must change. Change is difficult in general, but especially so when it involves staring down institutional bias and ingrained behaviors. It won’t be easy, and it will take time, but we absolutely must make a determined effort now to see it through. If we don’t start, we cannot ever finish. We feel change starts with our own leadership, including how we hire and select employees, how we train new employees, how we distribute work and conduct assignments, how we promote and reward employees, and every single day setting the tone for what is and what is not acceptable and appropriate. We are also committed as stalwart supporters of our public safety personnel, including our police department. They, too, are valued members of our community. They train and work hard for our benefit. They sacrifice time from their families to work around the clock. They risk their lives to look after us. We ask much of them, and for that they have our enduring gratitude and respect. We also demand that they behave at an incredibly high level of professionalism. Should any member of our Police team fall short of our expectations in an egregious manner, we are committed to hold them swiftly accountable through a fair and objective evaluation of the circumstances they may have faced, but we will never allow willful or incompetent dereliction of duty to cast a cloud across the strong reputation of the incredible women and men of the WPD. There are many examples as to how our Police show their commitment to fair and just enforcement. While an exhaustive list may not be desirable here, we will be happy to share such a list with any interested parties. Three specific examples are worth highlighting. Through community policing, our officers are engaging with our various neighborhoods and community members by interacting with them regularly and directly. They wear body cameras to provide accurate and objective records of enforcement encounters. They all fulfill the requirement to complete verbal de-escalation training and crisis intervention training. These training programs focus on using enhanced verbal skills and appropriate body language to resolve issues with the least force possible. These efforts alone do not guarantee a peaceful outcome in every difficult circumstance, but they do have the potential to have an inordinate impact on situations of conflict. We do not pretend to have the answers to every question that needs asking, because no one does. But that absolutely will not deter us from meeting those questions head-on. That is why we look forward to developing a process to engage our community in a larger conversation about how we, together, can make progress towards shared solutions. At the same time, we will involve our strategic institutional partners in order to amplify the impact of our efforts across all areas of our community. Along the way it is possible that we may make mistakes and/or hit roadblocks, but in no way will those obstacles deter us from our charge. We have some tough conversations ahead and we ask all members of the community to join us in finding shared solutions. Perhaps through such grassroots efforts, we can begin to effect the healing change that our nation so desperately needs and that our community so dearly desires. William and Mary Police | Chief Cheesebro “Several of you have contacted me directly regarding the trauma and disappointment you are feeling about the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. I appreciate you reaching out. Over the last few years, WMPD has worked closely with members of the Student Assembly to prioritize and deliver proper police services for our students. I welcome student input on any issue, whether it is about strategies, equipment, training, communication or other areas. It is difficult to formulate a message that adequately addresses the events of last week. What I saw of officers restraining Mr. Floyd was unconscionable. After 40 years in law enforcement, it is heartbreaking to see these types of excessive force incidents still occurring and discouraging to see the impacts of rage across the country. I understand the outcry and the trauma. I share your anger for the needless loss of life. This department will not condone excessive force. My direction to our department will always be bias-free policing. Officers are expected to treat everyone with dignity, courtesy and respect. I will stand for no less. “Professional” is a word many claim, but far fewer deserve. It is not just about training, equipment, or looking good in uniform. It is about having the right heart as you go about your craft. It is about applying your knowledge and skills in a bias-free manner, and in fact, in a way that promotes inclusivity. Our officers will continue to rely on our values as a department and use our training and teamwork to keep you and others safe in our community. While there are instances where police do need to restrain someone, there is a right way for this to be done. The videos of Mr. Floyd’s arrest showed unwarranted, excessive force. It is long past due for these injustices to stop. It is critical that all police stay focused on doing the right thing, and that includes condemning these blatant violations of human rights. Sometimes I am asked about WMPD’s policing philosophy, where values drive our approach and decisions. We have a mission much broader than enforcing laws. We also focus on community. And in enforcing the law we strive to do so with good intent and sensitivity. WMPD needs to model the right way, every day. And in the event we make a mistake, we need to acknowledge that and work to improve. As we plan ahead for the coming semester, we will continue our partnership with Student Assembly and plan more formal opportunities for your input as well so we can listen to your comments, suggestions and concerns. I will also continue to meet with individual students and student groups by appointment and invitation. My door is always open. This fall I will also hold monthly, open Q&A sessions where we can answer your questions, hear your concerns and share updates on WMPD activities. We will continue our strong partnerships with the Williamsburg Police Department, James City County Police Department, Virginia State Police, York County Sheriff’s Office, and the Commonwealth Attorney’s Office. All of these agency officials are committed to providing professional, fair and unbiased services. We will invite these partners to the Q&A open sessions and other fora. I am always in pursuit of better policing. I think we can continue that process together.” Norfolk Mayor Kenneth Alexander “In the wake of recent tragedies involving police brutality and racially motivated violence, let’s continue to have our actions speak to positively to the memory of those who have been tragically lost. Police brutality and hate crimes must stop and they will not find safe harbor in today’s Norfolk. For 338 years, Norfolk has struggled with its own history of human bondage, hate, racially motivated crime and violence, structural inequality, and poverty. We have determined that the continued success of our city will be determined by our ability to recognize our legacy of injustice, atone and appreciate everyone’s humanity, and begin the long process of healing together. Our continued growth and evolution as a modern city will always demand this. Norfolk is by no means perfect, but we will continue to strive to be just especially in the administration of public safety. I want to recognize the Norfolk Police Department for being responsive, upholding their duty to protect every citizen and hearing citizens’ concerns. We are all learning from the protests that have occurred and hope that they will continue in a manner that honors the lives of those we have lost to injustice and hate. Let’s keep engaging one another, let’s remain in peaceful dialogue with one another, and let’s keep learning from one another. To examine, evaluate and discuss disparities in health, housing, education, employment, and economic opportunity and well-being among Norfolk’s residents, I am forming a Mayor’s Commission on Social Equity and Economic Opportunity. This commission should address historical and persistent issues that have impacted access and opportunity for Norfolk’s residents, while examining social and economic anxiety, and creating a true bridge that should connect Norfolk’s various communities. There will be a focus on wealth building, employment and job training, disparities in educational opportunity and attainment, access to technology, criminal justice reform and Norfolk’s continued commitment to community based public safety. This committee should be careful to avoid symbolic gestures of reconciliation. I have asked Councilwoman Andria McClellan to serve as vice-chair and each member of council is to recommend an individual from the community to serve.” Virginia Beach Superintendent Dr. Aaron Spence I’d like to take a moment to address some of the events affecting us locally, nationally and globally. Imagine viewing the world from a young person’s perspective right now. Not only is the human race suffering the ravages of a health crisis, but we’re now also witnessing the pain and anger over generations of racism and hatred laid bare in the streets of our cities and neighborhoods. It is impossible to shake the images of prejudice, injustice and violence that populate social media feeds and flash across our screens. It is deeply distressing for so many of us, but I worry principally for our students—and especially for our Black students—because we know our youngest citizens do not yet have the ability to put these sounds and photos and words into any kind of context. The events happening in our country are painful, and they are igniting a call to action. I do not pretend to have a full comprehension of what our Black families are feeling right now, but please know we stand with you in this moment. And to that end, I know we can and must do more regarding equity and anti-racism work. We can show up every day to this work with empathy. We can be introspective and reflective and open to understanding our blind spots. We can and must continue to condemn racism and injustice and work to disrupt it where it exists. And as the leader of the largest school division in Hampton Roads, I can embolden our educators and community members to do the same. We must champion equity in our every decision and action. We can and must be models of respect and kindness for our students, and we can and must provide a meaningful and inclusive educational experience for every single child in our schools. It is my job to make sure we have the tools to do so. Most pressingly, we have to help our children make sense of what is happening right now and give them hope for their future. We have put together a list of resources that can help with engaging them in conversations about race and conflict. Our school librarians have also compiled a list of age-appropriate books that may also assist with working through and answering questions about difficult issues. Yet clearly, that’s not enough. While, yes, we are tasked with educating the children of Virginia Beach, I am also resolved to more action within our community. So I am asking myself some hard questions right now. Can this be the moment in our history that we effect real change? How do we alleviate this pain and suffering caused by the pervasive and systemic racism that has always been and remains a part of our nation’s history? We cannot just leave it to the next generations to fix. We cannot doom our children to this history that keeps repeating and repeating itself. With this in mind, our VBCPS Equity Council, made up of community members and stakeholders from across the division, will continue to meet and develop effective ways to get the entire community involved in this work and to come up with targeted strategies and actions to support our families. To get this conversation moving, you are invited to a virtual community conversation, How to Talk About Equity, Race and Recent Events, next Tuesday, June 9, at 5 p.m., featuring a panel of leaders in equity work that will be moderated by Barbara Hamm Lee. I hope you will join us in this conversation. These past months have been so very trying and tiring. Not only have you had to become teachers overnight, but you’ve been expected to be experts in everything from math to history to conflict resolution. In the face of all of this, we’ve learned the most important thing we can do for our children is to make sure they know they are loved and cared for. That’s more important now than ever. We must listen to them when they are frightened, confused or in need of our direction and advice. Together, with love, with compassion and empathy and respect for one another, I know we can make our community stronger and our world a better and more hopeful place for our children. As we move ahead, I ask you to take care of yourselves and take care of each other. United Way of South Hampton Roads We at United Way of South Hampton Roads are heartbroken by the tragic events of this past week, and we firmly stand in solidarity with all who seek a more just and equitable society. Our mission is to bring people and resources together to solve problems too big for any of us to solve alone. We do this work in order to lift our entire community and serve as a voice for the unheard. Unfortunately, as we’ve observed throughout our nation’s history and have been reminded of most recently in the wake of George Floyd’s death, race holds a central place in our society’s deepest and most persistent challenges. Systemic and structural barriers for people of color continue to stand in the way of our ability to achieve our mission. For this very reason, United Way of South Hampton Roads will continue to incorporate an equity and inclusion lens in every facet of our work. In order to strengthen the social fabric of our community, we are advancing equitable opportunities through our collaborations, fundraising and grantmaking. Our aim is to help lead the lasting and transformational changes needed in policies and practices. We prioritize this work so that all our neighbors, businesses and institutions have what they need to succeed and thrive. ODU Vice President Sanderlin and Interim Vice President Stansberry Old Dominion University remains committed to diversity, equity and inclusive excellence. These values form the pillars of our campus community. We are outraged at the senseless deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. The recent horrific events mirroring systemic racism make it woefully apparent that there is much work to do towards promoting equity for all. We echo the words expressed by President Broderick on Friday: “As a diverse and inclusive campus, we must continue to do our collective best to demonstrate for the world that at ODU we strive to learn from differences leading to a greater understanding of one another.” To this end, the Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity, the Division of Student Engagement and Enrollment Services and the President’s Task Force on Inclusive Excellence are partnering to host learning events, webinars and virtual forums throughout the summer and fall to equip our faculty, students and staff to engage in meaningful dialogue and take constructive action to address these pressing societal issues. It is important that we provide tools, resources, protocols and opportunities that will assist in guiding conversations that support freedom of diverse expression, while promoting social justice for all. These engaging opportunities will assist members of the Monarch Nation to be advocates and allies for groups of people who have felt invisible and marginalized. Soon you will receive “save the dates” for these programs. We are counting on your participation and support. United States Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger, Eastern District of Virginia These have been difficult and challenging times over the past 10 weeks due first to a pervasive pandemic and now as a result of great societal unrest. We witnessed the harrowing and disturbing video images of the death of George Floyd. We watched many peaceful protestors exercise their constitutional rights to protest legitimate grievances. And while it should be a time for the nation to grieve, scream, pray, shake with anger, reconcile, and heal, some have turned to violence, destruction, arson, assault, and domestic terrorism. Many individuals gathering to protest in the Eastern District have done so peacefully. Unfortunately, there are some individuals who seek to actively undermine the efforts of peaceful protestors by inciting violence and destroying the very physical and figurative sinew of local communities of which they are not members. Following the decisive leadership of Attorney General Barr, we will utilize the existing framework of the Joint Terrorism Task Force model to identify, apprehend and prosecute anyone who uses the guise of protest to incite violence and violate federal laws. As always, we stand ready to support our federal, state, and local law enforcement officers who bravely put themselves in harm’s way to ensure citizens across the Commonwealth can safely exercise their First Amendment rights. Port of Virginia The tension surrounding George Floyd’s murder and the nationwide demonstrations and protests have helped many of us confront the realities of the systemic racist practices and injustice that have been part of the daily lives of Black Americans. We, the colleagues of The Port of Virginia, remain committed to our values and to each other, and we stand together in solidarity with the Black community in the fight against a centuries-old pattern of violence and suppression. We know there is still much work to be done. We must all have open, honest, and compassionate dialogue with each other and be open to listening and learning if we expect to see any positive changes. BlackLivesMatter #WeStandTogether WJCC Commonwealth’s Attorney Nathan Green “As the elected Commonwealth’s Attorney for the City of Williamsburg and the County of James City, I stand with the other prosecutors throughout Virginia in condemning the brutal, senseless, and inexcusable killing of George Floyd. Mr. Floyd’s death at the hands of a police officer, sworn to protect and serve all citizens, strikes at the heart of our mission as prosecutors to treat all people as equal and to see that justice is served. Racism, bigotry, and prejudice are deplorable in any form. These evils are particularly intolerable when they interfere with a citizen’s God given right to life and liberty. This office rejects the use of unnecessary force by law enforcement officers against any member of our community. I reaffirm our commitment to pursuing the zealous prosecution and punishment for those who would abuse their status as law-enforcement officers to humiliate, hurt, and kill. Our paramount duty as prosecutors is to keep our fellow citizens safe from harm and to punish, through the rule of law, those who harm them. We share that duty with the hard-working, self-sacrificing law-enforcement officers of this community who risk their lives to protect our citizens and who must carry the burden of making amends for the abuses not of their making, but of the worst among them. To my fellow citizens who have peacefully protested, I share your grief and anger. I recognize that the killing of George Floyd is but the latest unnecessary killing of a black person while under state control. I commit this office to have honest conversations with our law-enforcement agencies and our communities to ensure that we are not just policing but that we are policing in a manner that is truly intended to protect and serve each and every one of our citizens. ‘The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.’ – Edmund Burke I promise that under my leadership this office will redouble its efforts to apply the law fairly to all people, to root out implicit and explicit bias in our ranks, to balance consistency with empathy and to advocate for positive meaningful change to our criminal justice system where needed.” Hampton University President Dr. William R. Harvey The current state of affairs in our nation today saddens and enrages me. Equal justice under the law is a cornerstone of liberty, but this was not the case with Mr. George Floyd. He was murdered by a white Minneapolis policeman who put his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck until he died. The policeman in question and those who stood around and watched this crime being committed have now been arrested, but should have been arrested immediately. It is my hope that they will all be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. As president of Hampton University and one who witnessed and participated in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950’s and 1960’s, I am pleased to see those who have initiated peaceful protests expressing their concerns about police brutality, particularly towards African Americans. During the late 1950’s and 1960’s, I participated in marches and other peaceful protests that were led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I was also the vice-president of a statewide student Civil Rights organization. My father was a building contractor and Civil Rights leader. Therefore, our household was one of those homes that was a meeting place for the local organizations. It also served as a rest stop for out of town travelers who could not use public accommodations because of the racism of the time. For those travelers, most of these visits occurred on the weekends and might include a meal, a glass of tea or lemonade, a nap on the living room sofa, or an overnight stay. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. visited several times although I do not recall him spending the night. His brother Rev. A. D. King was a frequent visitor and overnight guest. Their visits always included interesting conversations. I shall forever be indebted to my father for allowing me to sit in on some of those meetings. He gave me permission to be present with the proviso that I could not ask a question, venture an opinion, or otherwise speak. As he would say, “You are to listen and learn.” In these meetings, there were conversations about successes, failures, problems, promises, and plans for progress in the Civil Rights Movement. Some of the attendees urged the abandonment of peaceful demonstrations and encouraged violent responses that matched the batons, bullets, hoses, and dogs used by police against us. Dr. King spoke out strongly against the use of these tactics. He felt that it would hurt our cause, and he was proven right. In that same vein, I think that our cause is hurt today when we focus more on retaliation and less on seeking police reform and justice. While peaceful protestors rally to make their voices heard, the violence, looting, and destruction of property are not the solution. These acts hinder the cause of justice that so many are seeking. Peaceful demonstration is a part of African American history, but engaging in the above-mentioned acts hurts our cause. To be sure, there will be criticism for those of us who believe in peaceful protest to achieve desired goals and objectives. I do not have all of the answers, but three specific thoughts come to mind. First, now is the time for us to again come together in our homes and churches to have conversations about how we can move forward as a people and as a nation to end police brutality against African Americans. Secondly, every municipality in the country should establish a colloquium board to facilitate dialogue between representatives of the police and the African American community to include ministers, educators, organizational leaders, and other citizens of good-will. Thirdly, every state and local police academy as well as other providers of law enforcement officers should establish a mandatory class on policing in the African American community. While I cannot claim to know all of the answers to these problems nor the timeline for resolution, I do know that nothing can be accomplished unless we work together for the betterment of ourselves, our communities, and our nation. Until this happens, justice will not served. All of us must understand the immorality of racism as we support the victims of racial discrimination.

Ministers who hosted it encouraged everyone to fight injustices in a peaceful and purposeful way. VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — One of Virginia Beach's best-known landmarks became the site of a peaceful protest which encouraged people to end racism, police brutality, and injustices. The ministers who staged the event at Mount Trashmore encouraged people to do it in a peaceful and purposeful way, the same way they approached the demonstration. People were looking to ""fill the hill"" at Mount Trashmore in response to the death of George Floyd who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nine minutes. Many of the people at the protest took to a single knee in remembrance of Floyd. Their message was clear, powerful, but most of all peaceful. “We disrupt by standing on a hill, lifting our voices and letting everybody know that we will be silent no more,” said Pastor Jason Knight. Knight is a part of the Virginia Beach interdenominational ministers conference who organized the gathering. “Pain that we are feeling affects everybody,” Knight said. Knight asked people to lift their voices for the voiceless. “For the George Floyd that cannot talk anymore, for the Ahmaud Arbery that cannot talk anymore, for the Breonna Taylor that cannot talk anymore,” Knight said. Familiar faces like Congresswoman Elaine Luria, Councilman Aaron Rouse joined in. “We cannot continue to stand by and not act,” said Congresswoman Luria.

Police from multiple counties, including the Virginia State Police, then proceeded to swarm the area to put down what was deemed ‘civil unrest’ by the Prince William County Police Department. Even with police present, protestors continued to throw bottles and rocks from the parking lot of a nearby Red Lobster. “During the protests, multiple businesses along the Sudley Rd corridor sustained damage and two small fires were reported to shrubbery and a trash receptacle. Numerous police vehicles were also reportedly damaged throughout the evening,” stated Johnathan Perok, the Public Information Office Supervisor for the Prince William County Police in a press release. Protestors were requested to vacate the area by police, and ‘given the opportunity to disperse peacefully.’ Many did not follow police orders, and police proceeded to use tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them. “Since I was in front of the crowd, I inhaled some of it [tear gas] and ended up running because it was too much to handle. I started coughing and I have to rub my eyes as well. Fortunately, I wasn’t hit by a rubber bullet, but it landed near me,” said Emily Jasmine Reyes, a protestor and Stonewall Jackson High School student. The protest resulted in five arrests, including a DUI and ‘other offenses for driving through a police perimeter,” the injury of four Prince William County police officers, one of whom was taken to a local hospital. Following the riot, police called for calm in the community. Updated 11:30 p.m.",0.0

Ralph Northam – speaking inside the adjacent Patrick Henry Building – addressed the unrest over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Virginia’s movement into Phase 2 of the reopening process. “Racism and discrimination aren’t locked in our past, they weren’t solved with the Civil Rights Act, they didn’t disappear,” Northam said, referencing Floyd’s death and the subsequent five days of protests and riots they have sparked. “They evolved.” During the press conference, Northam and a panel of black community leaders – which included Varina District Supervisor Tyrone Nelson and Delegate Delores McQuinn – discussed what the state needs to do in order to stop systemic racism. They concluded that the expansion of Medicaid so more people of color can acquire health care coverage; a reformed criminal justice system; the decriminalization of marijuana; the elimination of certain voting restrictions; and the continuation of diversity training and other training in state and local police departments would be among the necessary steps. Meanwhile, Phase 2 of the state’s reopening will begin statewide Friday, except for Northern Virginia and Richmond, and will include: • an increase in the allowed number of people at a gathering from 10 to 50; • the permitted reopening of restaurants’ indoor dining at 50 percent of their capacities; • the permitted reopening of gyms and fitness facilities at 30 percent of their capacities; • the permitted reopening of swimming pools, with some restrictions; • the permitted reopening of venues such as zoos, museums and botanical gardens, with some restrictions; • the reopening of some recreational sports, with social distancing rules in place. Northam will discuss Phase 2 in greater details Thursday, he said. During Tuesday’s briefing, Northam was asked to address President Trump’s conversation Monday with the country’s governors. “The message regrettably was not one of healing, it was not one of unity – it was one of divisiveness,” Northam said. Trump requested that the Virginia National Guard be deployed to Washington, D.C., but Northam said he denied the request, saying it would be in the state’s best interested to keep its members in the state. “I am not going to send out men and women in uniform, of a very proud National Guard, to Washington for a photo op,” Northam said.",0.0

McClellan asked protesters to “sustain this momentum.” “This is a marathon, not a sprint and we need you to stay focused in holding your leaders accountable,” McClellan said through a bullhorn. “We’re inviting you to take a seat at the table.” Richmond protesters had several demands, which were expressed to Stoney, including lifting the 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, releasing the protesters who were detained, and firing the Richmond police officers who tear-gassed protesters throughout the weekend. The group also had long-term requests, such as the removal of the city’s Confederate memorials, which are now covered in protest signs and graffiti. Stoney has expressed support for the measure but would need City Council’s approval. Protesters asked Stoney to establish a diverse citizen review board, which would evaluate police, release records of all African Americans who have been arrested in Richmond in the last year and establish a “Marcus Alert,” which would require police to bring in mental health professionals when a person is having a crisis. Stoney told protesters that some of their requests were out of his hands. He said the commonwealth’s attorney for Richmond, Colette McEachin, controls all legal proceedings against protesters. Stoney gave the crowd McEachin’s phone number, 804-316-0568, but many said her mailbox was full at the time. McEachin tweeted a statement on Tuesday, saying her office would evaluate allegations of criminal behavior — including those against law enforcement — and bring “appropriate” charges. Protesters agreed to meet at the Robert E. Lee statue on Wednesday at 2 p.m. Stoney, along with Richmond Police Chief Will Smith, agreed to march with the protesters during a town hall meeting at noon on Tuesday.

People who spoke with 10 On Your Side on Wednesday morning said they came out with pure intentions to speak out against police brutality and the senseless death of George Floyd. Police say there were nearly 600 people that started to march on Mercury Blvd. around 9 p.m., marching up and down Mercury, before splitting into two groups. One group returned to the Target parking lot, where they prayed, hugged and took a knee with police. The other group went up on I-64 for about an hour and blocked traffic. VDOT Hampton Roads said all lanes were blocked on Interstate 64 eastbound and westbound, but didn’t specify whether they were closed due to any demonstrations. The lanes had all reopened by 11:30 p.m. Both witnesses and police told 10 On Your Side things took a turn around midnight. Police say demonstrators surrounded the officers, and someone from the crowd released a smoke bomb. People started throwing glass bottles of urine and feces at officers, and someone started firing shots, police said. Police say that’s when they declared an unlawful assembly, and deployed tear gas on the crowd. Then the group members ran into the Town Center complex, and vandalism of businesses started. “Once they fired off to the crowd, the crowd ran this way and scattered. Once they scattered, that’s when people started tearing up businesses … about four or five businesses they looted or destroyed,” said witness EJ Jones. “And the sad part about it is, about 3 or 4 of these businesses are Black businesses.” It’s unclear how many businesses were vandalized, police said, but there were at least five.

Park of the church was set on fire during protests on Sunday night. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) WASHINGTON – WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s Pentagon chief shot down his idea of using active-duty troops to quell protests across the United States, and former military leaders are going after him, too, in an extraordinary clash between the U.S. military and its commander in chief. Both Trump and Defense Secretary Mark Esper are both drawing stinging, rare public criticism from Trump's first defense secretary, Jim Mattis, in the most public pushback of Trump's presidency from the men he put at the helm of the world's most powerful military. Mattis' rebuke on Wednesday followed Trump's threats to use the military to “dominate” the streets where Americans are demonstrating following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. The president had urged governors to call out the National Guard to contain protests that turned violent and warned that he could send in active-duty military forces if they did not. Esper angered Trump when he said he opposed using military troops for law enforcement, seemingly taking the teeth out of the president’s threat to use the Insurrection Act. Esper said the 1807 law should be invoked in the United States “only in the most urgent and dire of situations.” He added, “We are not in one of those situations now.” After his subsequent visit to the White House, the Pentagon abruptly overturned an earlier decision to send a couple hundred active-duty soldiers home from the Washington, D.C., region, a public sign of the growing tensions with the White House. Then on Thursday, a defense official said the soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division were heading back to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, after all. Former Secretary Mattis, a retired Marine general, lambasted both Trump and Esper in an essay in The Atlantic for their consideration of using the active-duty military in law enforcement — and for the use of the National Guard in clearing out a largely peaceful protest near the White House on Monday evening. “We must reject any thinking of our cities as a 'battlespace' that our uniformed military is called upon to 'dominate,'” Mattis wrote, referencing quotes by Esper and Trump respectively. “Militarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington, D.C., sets up a conflict — a false conflict — between the military and civilian society. ” Trump responded on Twitter by calling Mattis “the world’s most overrated General,” adding: “I didn’t like his ‘leadership’ style or much else about him, and many others agree, Glad he is gone!” Yet another former military leader, retired Marine Corps four-star general John Allen, said that events on Monday, the day Trump walked to the church, “may well signal the beginning of the end of the American experiment.” Allen, president of the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution, contrasted the routing of the protesters in Lafayette Park with remarks by Floyd’s brother, Terrence Floyd, who denounced looting that he said tarnishes his brother’s memory. Writing in Foreign Policy, Allen urged people to make their votes in November for the future of America’s democracy. “It will have to come from the bottom up. For at the White House, there is no one home,"" he wrote. Days ago, Esper had ordered about 1,300 Army personnel to military bases just outside the nation’s capital as Trump weighed whether to invoke the Insurrection Act and send active-duty troops into the city, the scene of large protests that devolved into violence and looting over the weekend. But after a night of calm enforced by a large deployment of National Guard troops and heavily armed federal law enforcement agents, defense officials said the troops would begin returning to their home base. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told The Associated Press that the decision was reversed after Esper's visit to the White House. The White House didn't respond to request for comment on whether Trump ordered the change. The shift added to confusion over the president's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act for protests following Floyd's death in Minneapolis. White House officials had indicated even before Esper’s comments that Trump was backing away from invoking the act, though officials said Trump was upset that Esper's statement conveyed “weakness.” Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president was still willing to deploy federal troops despite Esper's comments. Meanwhile, the president was taking credit for the deployment of federal and other law enforcement officers to the nation’s capital, saying it offered a model to states on how to stop violence accompanying some protests nationwide. On Wednesday evening, troops and others were out in force in Washington. A Defense official said at least 2,200 National Guard members would be on the streets. Helmeted forces formed a ring around Lafayette Park across from the White House. Military vehicles were parked at intersections, also blocking access. Trump argued that the massive show of force was responsible for protests in Washington and other cities turning more calm in recent days and repeated his criticism of governors who have not deployed their National Guard to the fullest. “You have to have a dominant force,” Trump told Fox News Radio on Wednesday. “We need law and order.” Pentagon chief Esper himself has come under fire from critics, including retired senior military officers, for having walked from the White House on Monday evening with Trump and others for a presidential photo opportunity in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, which had previously sustained damage from protesters. “I was not aware a photo op was happening,” he said, adding that he also did not know that police had forcibly moved peaceful protesters from the park to clear the way for Trump and his entourage. Mattis, in his essay, called the scene an “abuse of executive authority."" The retired general quit the Trump administration in December 2018 after months of conflict with the president as Trump announced he was unilaterally withdrawing American troops from Syria. Though the crackdown on the Washington demonstrations was praised by some Trump supporters Tuesday, a handful of Republicans expressed concern that law enforcement officers risked violating the protesters’ First Amendment rights. The clampdown followed a weekend of demonstrations outside the White House. Trump had been furious about images juxtaposing fires set in the park outside the executive mansion with a darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials. He was also angry about the news coverage revealing he had gone to the secure White House bunker during Friday’s protests. Trump on Wednesday acknowledged he visited the bunker Friday but claimed he was only conducting an inspection as protests raged outside the White House gates. Soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division remain on standby at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and Fort Belvoir in Virginia outside Washington. ___ AP writers Michael Balsamo and Lolita C.

(AP Photo/Wong Maye-E) NEW YORK – New York City police officers surrounded, shoved and yelled expletives at two Associated Press journalists covering protests Tuesday in the latest aggression against members of the media during a week of unrest around the country. Portions of the incident were captured on video by videojournalist Robert Bumsted, who was working with photographer Maye-E Wong to document the protests in lower Manhattan over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The video shows more than a half-dozen officers confronting the journalists as they filmed and took photographs of police ordering protesters to leave the area near Fulton and Broadway shortly after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect. An officer, using an expletive, orders them to go home. Bumsted is heard on video explaining the press are considered “essential workers"" and are allowed to be on the streets. An officer responds “I don't give a s—-.” Another tells Bumsted “get the f—- out of here you piece of s—-."" Bumsted and Wong said officers shoved them, separating them from each other and pushing them toward Bumsted's car, which was parked nearby. At one point Bumsted said he was pinned against his car. He is heard on video telling the officer that Wong has his keys and he needs them to leave the area. Officers then allowed Wong to approach and the two got in the vehicle and left. Both journalists were wearing AP identification and identified themselves as media. “They didn't care,” Wong said. “They were just shoving me.” NYPD officials said they would “review this as soon as possible.” Journalists have faced aggressive police and protesters during demonstrations across the U.S. over the killing of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck. Police in Louisville, Kentucky, apologized after an officer fired what appeared to be pepper bullets at a TV news crew, and a journalist in Minneapolis was shot by a rubber bullet. Journalists have faced other risks while covering the unrest, in addition to dealing with aggression from police. In South Carolina, a television news reporter was hit in the head by a thrown rock and outside the White House, a Fox News reporter was chased and pummeled by protesters. Someone grabbed the reporter’s microphone and threw it at his back, and a Fox News photographer’s camera was smashed. In Atlanta, demonstrators who fought with police and set cars on fire also broke windows and scrawled obscene graffiti at CNN headquarters. AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton criticized the officers' actions Tuesday, which occurred as thousands of people in New York were defying a curfew put in place following several nights of violence and destruction. Journalists covering the story are exempt from the curfew. “The role of journalists is to report the news on behalf of the public,"" Easton said.

She said the Group of 20's suspension will free about $11 billion until the end of the year, but it's estimated that eligible countries have an additional $20 billion in multilateral and commercial debt combined coming due this year.

The demonstration in Paris and similar protests in other French cities on Tuesday were organized to honor Frenchman Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016 and to support Americans demonstrating against the death of George Floyd' in the U.S. state of Minnesota. Paris police banned the gathering a few hours before it was supposed to start, citing virus restrictions forbidding gatherings of more than 10 people.

Total confirmed cases now number 233,515, although authorities say many people with mild symptoms may have had the virus but never underwent testing. Italy also reported 55 more virus-related deaths in the same 24-hour period, raising the national death toll from the pandemic to 33,530. Since many elderly people who died during the outbreak in nursing homes or in their own homes weren't tested, authorities acknowledge that the actual death toll is likely much higher. A government-ordered ban on travel between regions is set to end on Wednesday. Italy also will start allowing in tourists from most of Europe. ___ KARACHI, Pakistan -- Two Pakistani lawmakers have died after testing positive for the coronavirus amid a spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths.

Fernando Sim�n added that the number of patients being treated in intensive care units has also been declining, with only nine people admitted to ICUs over the past seven days. Spain's official national death toll from the pandemic is 27,127, while the country has almost 240,000 confirmed cases. ___ DUBAI, United Arab Emirates "" Dubai has announced that shopping malls and the private sector can operate at full capacity starting Wednesday following weeks of restrictions and curfews. Still, people must adhere to social distancing and wear face masks in public. Some of Dubai's largest malls have already installed thermal scanners at gates to check the temperatures of all entering. In recent days, Dubai "" known for its sprawling malls, shopping and luxury hotels "" has also opened some public beaches, parks and gyms. Mosques, public pools, amusement parks, nurseries and schools remain closed. The capital of the United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, began restricting movement in and out of the city for a week starting Tuesday. Abu Dhabi said the move is aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 there. ___ ATHENS, Greece "" Greek authorities have temporarily suspended flights from Qatar until June 15, after 12 people on a flight from Doha tested positive for the coronavirus. Authorities have quarantined all 91 passengers from the flight that landed Monday. International flights to Greece are currently only allowed into Athens, with all passengers subject to compulsory coronavirus tests. The Civil Protection Agency said Tuesday nine of the passengers who tested positive were Pakistani nationals with residence permits in Greece, two were Greek citizens coming from Australia and one was a Japanese national from a Greek-Japanese family. Greece currently has a very low coronavirus rate, with 179 deaths and just over 2,900 confirmed positive cases. Health authorities announced zero deaths on Tuesday, and 19 new confirmed positive cases, including the 12 from the Doha flight. ___ ROME "" Hundreds of demonstrators have gathered in Rome shunning masks to protest against the Italian government's measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Members of a marginal political movement created last year by a retired Carabinieri general have emerged as a virus-denial camp in Italy, the first Western country to be hit by the global pandemic. The leader of the so-called Orange Vests told the protest crowd assembled in the Piazza del Popolo on Tuesday that children shouldn't be made to wear masks and he threatened to ''slap'' anyone who did. Antonio Pappalardo added that he refuses to wear a mask himself and said: ''These lungs mine. I will take care of my lungs. Breathing is sacred.'' The people packing the square didn't adhere to social-distancing guidelines set by the government. Other speakers at the protest asserted that the pandemic ''never existed'' and alleged that politicians had played it up to enhance their own powers. ___ TOKYO "" The governor of Tokyo has issued a coronavirus alert for the Japanese capital amid worries of a resurgence of infections only a week after a state of emergency ended. Governor Yuriko Koike issued a 'Tokyo alert' on Tuesday after 34 new cases were confirmed in the city, where confirmed infections had slowed to a few per day in late May. Koike said: 'The alert is to precisely inform the people of the status of infections and to advise caution.' Lighting on Tokyo's Rainbow Bridge will be changed from rainbow-colored to red as a sign of alert. However, the alert does not mean restrictions that just got eased will be reimposed immediately. Under the second phase of a three-part plan for resuming business activity, Tokyo's theaters, fitness gyms and other commercial facilities reopened. Night clubs, karaoke parlors and other highest-risk establishments are still closed. shut observing shutdown requests. ___ MOSCOW "" Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed his government to take quick steps to repair economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin reported to Putin on Tuesday that the Cabinet's plan contains measures designed to stimulate economic growth, raise incomes and reduce unemployment. It envisages spending 5 trillion rubles (about $73 billion) until December 2021. A partial economic shutdown that Putin ordered in late March to stem the country's outbreak badly hurt an economy already battered by a sharp drop in oil prices. The Russian leader says the nation is now past the peak of contagion, allowing regional officials to gradually ease the restrictions. However, some experts warned that a daily increase of about 9,000 confirmed cases makes a quick lifting of the lockdown dangerous. ____ LONDON "" A leading epidemiologist said the coronavirus outbreak in the U.K. is unlikely to worsen during the summer but that the outlook from September was 'very unclear.' Professor Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London said he expects levels of coronavirus transmissions and cases to 'remain relatively flat between now and September, short of very big policy changes or behavior changes in the community.' He told a committee of lawmakers in the House of Lords on Tuesday that the 'real uncertainty' will be in September. Ferguson resigned from his position as a government adviser last month after revelations that he broke social-distancing rules. A coronavirus lockdown is being eased across the U.K., most quickly in England, raising concerns among many health officials of a potential second spike in infections. ___ Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",0.0

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — One of Virginia Beach's best-known landmarks became the site of a peaceful protest which encouraged people to end racism, police brutality, and injustices. The ministers who staged the event at Mount Trashmore encouraged people to do it in a peaceful and purposeful way, the same way they approached the demonstration. People were looking to ""fill the hill"" at Mount Trashmore in response to the death of George Floyd who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nine minutes. Many of the people at the protest took to a single knee in remembrance of Floyd. Their message was clear, powerful, but most of all peaceful. “We disrupt by standing on a hill, lifting our voices and letting everybody know that we will be silent no more,” said Pastor Jason Knight. Knight is a part of the Virginia Beach interdenominational ministers conference who organized the gathering. “Pain that we are feeling affects everybody,” Knight said. Knight asked people to lift their voices for the voiceless. “For the George Floyd that cannot talk anymore, for the Ahmaud Arbery that cannot talk anymore, for the Breonna Taylor that cannot talk anymore,” Knight said. Familiar faces like Congresswoman Elaine Luria, Councilman Aaron Rouse joined in. “We cannot continue to stand by and not act,” said Congresswoman Luria.

Biden and President Donald Trump easily swept their respective primary contests that ranged from Maryland to Montana and featured the night's biggest prize: Pennsylvania. The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the monthslong state-by-state primary season. Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March. Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in 'militarized zones' because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. 'Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,' Kramer said. Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as 'more interested in power than in principle.' Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party. The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. 'Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,' Autiello said. 'So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.' Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines. 'We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,' said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday 'to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.' Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON – The National Guard of the District of Columbia is investigating the use of one of its helicopters to make a “show of force” against protesters near the White House, while President Donald Trump is encouraging authorities to get tougher to quell the unrest over George Floyd's death. The helicopter, normally designated for use in medical evacuations, hovered low enough to create a deafening noise and spray protesters with rotor wash on Monday. The commanding general of the D.C. Guard, Maj. Gen. William Walker, said in a statement Wednesday that he directed the investigation, and officials The investigation comes as the federal government has promised to maximize its law enforcement presence in the nation's capital. Scores of heavily-armed federal officers in tactical gear have been on the district's streets for days, after demonstrators set fires, broke store windows and stole items from the shelves and left police officers injured. The Trump administration has made an effort to show a use of force in Washington. Hours before a 7 p.m. curfew on Tuesday, cars were being stopped at military checkpoints downtown, and a cavalry of armored military vehicles could be seen driving through the district. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the administration had floated the idea of taking over the Metropolitan Police Department, a proposal she strongly rejected. She threatened to take legal action if the federal government attempted to do so. Two Defense Department officials said the administration had ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a “show of force” against demonstrators. They were protesting the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Police made over 300 arrests, mainly for violating the district’s curfew. Earlier Monday evening, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback moved aggressively to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House before President Donald Trump walked to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, Arlington County in Virginia pulled out its officers, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County officials said in a statement their officers never wielded their batons and did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas. After watching the scene unfold on live television, the police chief ordered all the officers to return to Virginia. Officials said they were reevaluating the mutual aid agreements to ensure officers “are never again put in a situation where they are asked to take action that is inconsistent with our values.” The U.S. Park Police said it gave three warnings over a loudspeaker before clearing the area of protesters, some of whom authorities said were becoming violent, throwing projectiles and trying to grab weapons. The agency said it used smoke canisters and pepper balls to disperse the crowd. Attorney General William Barr ordered law enforcement to clear the park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, before the president's remarks, and that led to police using force to disperse protesters, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Officials had decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block, after fires were set in the park the night before, the person said. When Barr arrived, he was surprised it hadn’t been done and directed action to be taken, according to the person, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. In a Monday call with governors, Trump and Barr encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airmen have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. The Justice Department had deployed agents from every one of its agencies, including the FBI’s Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, and riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons. The Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other Homeland Security agencies were also dispatched. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Lolita C.

Activists and residents are angry that Little Village businesses and homes are being vandalized amid protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, on May 25. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) MINNEAPOLIS – The two men stepped from the shadows as the car turned off an upscale shopping street into a residential area located on the far edge of the rioting that swept through Minneapolis. It was after midnight. A pair of metal dividers blocked the road, and the men stepped to either side of the car as it stopped. Both carried assault rifles. “Do you live here?” one of the men asked, politely, but forcefully. His hands rested casually on the rifle slung across his chest, and a pistol was strapped to his belt. “We have lots of old people here,” he continued, satisfied that the driver, an AP reporter, posed no danger. “We don’t want anyone to get hurt.” A week of civil unrest has led some Minneapolis residents near the epicenter of the violence to take steps to protect their homes and neighborhoods. They’ve stocked up on fire extinguishers and buckets, and formed scores of loose neighborhood watch groups — aided by a cluster of apps and social media — to share what they view as suspicious activity. Preparing for nightfall in Minneapolis has meant a new routine for many: stashing garbage cans to keep them from being tossed or set on fire, turning on lights and opening blinds. In some neighborhoods near large demonstrations, witnesses say it also includes residents armed with baseball bats, crowbars and the occasional pistol barricading their streets to keep violent protesters away. Similar scenes have started to emerge across the country as the angry protests have spread, along with a heightened sense of fear and diminished confidence that police will keep the peace. In Chicago’s heavily-Mexican Little Village enclave, neighborhood residents stood watch as shops were vandalized along a busy commercial strip. For some, it’s all a sign of community pride and rational response when policing has broken down, as it did in most destructive nights in Minneapolis last week. But others see a more troubling undercurrent in the anxiety and mobilization, particularly as it spreads to largely white neighborhoods that have seen little or no damage. “There’s a sense of state failure and into state failure comes private actions to protect one’s family and one’s community,” said Omar Wasow, an assistant professor of politics at Princeton University who writes about race and the politics of protest movements. “You take that and you layer it on the long, deep-rooted racist mythology that says, ‘I should be scared and black people are a threat,’ and you get a kind of circle-the-wagons behavior.”' Peter Baggenstos has felt the tension in his neighborhood, a largely white, wealthy pocket of Minneapolis about a mile from a stretch of stores that were vandalized. Baggenstos, a doctor who is African American, said he senses a lot of “passive policing"" at night, as neighbors keep lights on and trade text messages about cars or people on the street after curfew. “You’ve got that feeling that eyes are on you,” he said. As a result, his wife alerted the neighbors when Baggenstos came home late recently, driving his Tesla. It does not have a front license plate, something likely to raise suspicions these days. “People want to take control over what they feel they’re losing control of — in this case, it’s their personal well-being and that of their family members,” Baggenstos said. “But it's gotten to this level where it’s dangerous. It’s causing everyone to be paranoid.” He said he's particularly worried about the surge of rumors and claims on text chains and apps, technology that has transformed old notions of a neighborhood watch. Since protests first erupted in Minneapolis last week in response to the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes as he pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving, neighbors across south Minneapolis have rushed for updates on apps like Next Door, GroupMe and Citizen. By Tuesday, one GroupMe neighborhood watch group had swelled to 479 members, organized into seven smaller regions. Members, identified only by their first names and cross streets, posted a steady stream of descriptions of suspicious vehicles, loud popping sounds, worries about outsiders and objects that might be filled with accelerants used to set fires. “I would guess those are lawn bags,” one poster said. Residents have reason to be on alert. Arson and vandalism have devastated a large stretch of a vital corridor in south Minneapolis, and have spread beyond to pockets of neighboring St. Paul and some suburbs. State law enforcement authorities have said they've found caches of flammable liquids all over the metropolitan area, as well as stolen vehicles without license plates that they believe have been used to move the material. In the worst-hit neighborhoods, where store after store was sometimes burned to the ground and looting was brazen, groups of neighbors sometimes set up makeshift barricades at their street corners, standing behind them for hours with baseball bats and metal rods. But most of the tactics are far less confrontational. Michael Grunke, a 35-year-old who lives near where Floyd died, said he and other tenants in his building gathered hoses and buckets for water. The building manager bought up fire extinguishers before they sold out at some local hardware stores. The group stayed up all night, standing watch, he said — his way to show support for the peaceful protests. “This was a good thing I could do to help the community and make sure things weren’t getting destroyed and tarnishing the memory of George Floyd,” Grunke said. Joy Miciano, 47, lives with her husband and their two teenage children in the South Uptown area, where stores have been damaged but few buildings burned. She said she and her husband stayed up keeping watch Friday because they felt no police or firefighters would respond. “That’s what was worrisome to us — if this was coming our way, there was no one to call for help,” she said. __ Associated Press writers Sophia Tareen contributed from Chicago and Jeff Baenen contributed from Minneapolis.",0.0

Officials had decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block, after fires were set in the park the night before, the person said. When Barr arrived, he was surprised it hadn't been done and directed action to be taken, according to the person, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. In a Monday call with governors, Trump and Barr encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests. Trump said he was 'taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.' The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airmen have been activated "" 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. The Justice Department had deployed agents from every one of its agencies, including the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, and riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons. The Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other Homeland Security agencies were also dispatched. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other 'anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Lolita C.

Portions of the incident were captured on video by videojournalist Robert Bumsted, who was working with photographer Maye-E Wong to document the protests in lower Manhattan over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The video shows more than a half-dozen officers confronting the journalists as they filmed and took photographs of police ordering protesters to leave the area near Fulton and Broadway shortly after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect. An officer, using an expletive, orders them to go home. Bumsted is heard on video explaining the press are considered 'essential workers"" and are allowed to be on the streets. An officer responds 'I don't give a s""-.' Another tells Bumsted 'get the f""- out of here you piece of s""-."" Bumsted and Wong said officers shoved them, separating them from each other and pushing them toward Bumsted's car, which was parked nearby. At one point Bumsted said he was pinned against his car. He is heard on video telling the officer that Wong has his keys and he needs them to leave the area. Officers then allowed Wong to approach and the two got in the vehicle and left. Both journalists were wearing AP identification and identified themselves as media. 'They didn't care,' Wong said. 'They were just shoving me.' NYPD officials said they would 'review this as soon as possible.' Journalists have faced aggressive police and protesters during demonstrations across the U.S. over the killing of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck. Police in Louisville, Kentucky, apologized after an officer fired what appeared to be pepper bullets at a TV news crew, and a journalist in Minneapolis was shot by a rubber bullet. Journalists have faced other risks while covering the unrest, in addition to dealing with aggression from police. In South Carolina, a television news reporter was hit in the head by a thrown rock and outside the White House, a Fox News reporter was chased and pummeled by protesters. Someone grabbed the reporter's microphone and threw it at his back, and a Fox News photographer's camera was smashed. In Atlanta, demonstrators who fought with police and set cars on fire also broke windows and scrawled obscene graffiti at CNN headquarters. AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton criticized the officers' actions Tuesday, which occurred as thousands of people in New York were defying a curfew put in place following several nights of violence and destruction. Journalists covering the story are exempt from the curfew. 'The role of journalists is to report the news on behalf of the public,"" Easton said. ""It is unacceptable and deeply troubling when journalists are harassed simply for doing their job.'",0.0

WASHINGTON — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to ""dominate the streets."" In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy's flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: ""People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they're going to be like, 'Damn, we don't want them out here doing this ... again.'"" The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd's brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer's condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy ""thousands and thousands"" of U.S. troops. The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. ""The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,"" she said. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump's threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy National Guard units. The president was not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. For nearly a week since Floyd's death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. ""We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don't deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to ""dominate the streets,"" the U.S. military will step in to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" the president declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

U.S. stock indexes are moving higher in early trading Tuesday, following broad gains in global markets as investors hope that the gradual lifting of coronavirus lockdown mandates will put economies ravaged by the outbreak on the path to recovery. The S&P 500 was up 0.4%, adding to gains from the day before. Financial, industrial and other stocks that would stand to benefit the most from a growing economy moved higher. Energy companies also rose as the price of crude oil headed higher. Bond yields were mostly higher, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. The modest gains have the S&P 500 on track for a three-day winning streak, extending the benchmark index's remarkable two-month rally off a steep skid in February and March as broad swaths of the U.S. economy ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Wall Street's momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, spurring threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 189 points, or 0.7%, to 25,668. The Nasdaq composite was up 0.2%. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains in the early going. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.8%. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early Tuesday to kick off trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a breathtaking 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down just under 10% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. In Europe, France's CAC 40 jumped 2.1% Tuesday as the country opened restaurants, cafes, parks and beaches and launched a contract tracing app to help keep tabs on new contagions. Germany's DAX, which had been closed Monday, caught up with previous global markets' gains and surged 3.7%. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.9%. Markets in Asia closed broadly higher. While more countries and sectors are reopening, activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. And fears persist about a possible resurgence in coronavirus outbreaks in some countries. There were 34 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on Tuesday, seeming to reaffirm growing risks as people begin to mingle more in crowded commuter trains with the reopenings of more offices, schools, restaurants and stores. The daily numbers had dropped below 20 recently. Bond yields were mostly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.67% from 0.66% late Monday. Oil prices rose.

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011. The lay Catholic organization established it as a shrine to John Paul and added a permanent museum exhibit about his life. Daily masses are held at the shrine, which is a destination for Catholic pilgrims. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops declared it a national shrine on March 14, 2014, after John Paul was canonized as a saint. ""It is meant to be a place of genuine encounter with God that leads to a renewal of individuals, families, societies, and cultures,"" reads the shrine's official website, adding it is a place where God ""heals and renews every dimension of human life.""

PARIS — Thousands of French protesters defied a virus-related police ban and rallied Tuesday against racial injustice and heavy-handed police tactics, as global outrage over what happened to George Floyd in the United States kindled frustrations across borders and continents. Clapping, cheering and waving signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Police Everywhere, Justice Nowhere,"" the largely young, multiracial crowd streamed to the main Paris courthouse and rallied peacefully while police monitored closely from nearby corners. Earlier, thousands marched in Sydney, Australia's largest city, chanting ""I can't breathe,"" and expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. As protests escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. demonstrators increasingly mixed with local worries. ""When you refuse to treat the problem of racism ... it leads to what we see in the United States,"" said Dominique Sopo, head of French activist group SOS Racisme. ""The case of George Floyd echoes what we fear in France."" Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America -- and now, beyond. Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited by the police for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain banned in France as part of virus confinement measures. But the Paris protest plans drew attention online, and demonstrators showed up anyway. Similar demonstrations were held in other French cities in honor of Adama Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a pre-existing medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics -- and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans amid ongoing violent protests in the U.S. and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here. It doesn't matter if it's about the treatment of black men and women from here or from another country; enough is enough,"" she said. A total of 432 indigenous Australians have died in police detention since a 1991 Royal Commission — Australia's highest level of official inquiry — into Aboriginal deaths in custody, according to The Guardian newspaper. Australia has also never signed a treaty with the country's indigenous population, who suffer higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, plus shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment than white Australians. Another protest was planned Tuesday in the Dutch capital The Hague, and more than 6,000 people attended a Sweden-organized online protest to express support with the Black Lives Matter movement. Among speakers was Aysha Jones, a Gambia-born and Sweden-based activist and fashion blogger. Jones said the protest was important to show support to people in America, but also to remind Swedes that racism ""does exist here, it's very real and people are being harmed from it."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens.""",0.0

That’s ridiculous. We are students and we do not put up with it.” He was referring to a Facebook post put out by Chase alleging that protesters were going to come into Chesterfield beginning Monday night to cause disturbances, and she encouraged her supporters who are legal gun owners to “be on guard tonight” and protect themselves. Chase, R-Chesterfield, is seeking the GOP nomination for governor next year. She said she put out the warning after getting information from the Virginia Civilian Defense League that groups such as Antifa and others planned to rally throughout the county. Johnston and fellow county native Jorden Cofield, a student at Old Dominion University, led about 20 students from county high schools, including Thomas Dale and Matoaca, on a peaceful march through the courthouse area Monday night. They were accompanied by Chesterfield Police officers and carried signs that read “No Justice No Peace” and “Silence is Violence” among other messages. Their presence drew some county residents, including Chase, to the area, where they stood along a perimeter and watched the group, No incidents were reported, and the organizers welcomed the police presence. “They just came up to us and thanked us,” Cofield said of the officers. “And, they agreed to stand with us and protect us from anyone who tried to interfere with our peaceful protest.” Police Chief Jeffrey Katz was also in attendance, and he praised the students for the way they conducted themselves. “They were wonderful. They were really good kids,” Katz said. “I talked to one of their moms, and I thanked her. I said, ’You’ve raised some really good kids and you should be proud.’ It was a good experience.” Katz said he noticed that as the protesters walked by the county’s police memorial, they stopped for a moment of reverence. ""I was so touched by that. I got choked up,“ he said. ”I was very impressed...good kids. I feel good about our future.“ Chase said in an interview with The Progress-Index that the students misinterpreted her social-media postings, and she meant them no harm. “We had reports from Antifa sites that they were looking to infiltrate neighborhoods last night in Chesterfield and beyond to hijack peaceful protests, and we were there to reassure that peaceful protests were allowed to resume,” Chase said. “But if there were any bad actors that came out to hijack the peaceful protests, we’re going to be there to stand by our law enforcement and to quickly bring peace to the situation.” Johnston said more protests are planned for 5 p.m. for the next few Mondays, and Katz added his officers will be there to support the kids. Johnston also had some strong words for Chase. “If you do it again, it’s going to be even more protesting, more people,” he said, “and more than once a week.” Kristi K.

Polls began to close Tuesday night as voters navigated curfews and health concerns in a slate of primary contests that tested the nation's ability to host elections amid dueling crises and moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held elections, including four that delayed their April contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden easily won Indiana, which was the first state to begin closing polls at 7 p.m. Voting continued across Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania, two places rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. The dynamic was especially intense in Washington, where Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed a 7 p.m. curfew as law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops prepared for a fifth night of social unrest near the White House. A large fence was erected in front of the White House and military vehicles blocked some streets in downtown. While voters cast ballots from Maryland to Montana, Pennsylvania offered the day's biggest trove of delegates. The state also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. In-person voting numbers were down in every state as many voters were encouraged to vote by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic. Yet there were reports of long lines, particularly in minority communities in the Philadelphia area, where election officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. ""Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,"" Kramer said. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination. If he doesn't secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month. Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as ""more interested in power than in principle."" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. ""People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,"" Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party's platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. ""Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,"" Autiello said. ""So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important."" In Washington, the mayor ordered a 7 p.m. curfew, though voting places will be open until 8 p.m. Voting has been deemed essential, and city officials say voters will not be subject to arrest if they cast ballots during the curfew. Philadelphia moved its 6 p.m. curfew back to 8:30 p.m. for Tuesday to accommodate voting. ""We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,"" said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday ""to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place."" Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections, Idaho and Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and is now focused on other offices. ""We think we're prepared,"" Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairwoman Nancy Patton Mills said. ""Thank goodness we have the opportunity of working this out in the primary because we don't know where we'll be with the pandemic in November.""",0.0

Titled ""Appomattox,"" a statue in Alexandria, Virginia, depicted a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. It was erected in 1889 to honor Confederate soldiers. (Source: Twitter/Justin Wilson/CNN) A wave of Confederate memorial removals that began after a white supremacist killed nine black people at a Bible study in a church in South Carolina in 2015 is again rolling, with more relics of the Old South being removed from public view after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. In Birmingham, where Rudolph lives, the graffiti-covered, pocked base of a massive Confederate monument was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces overnight. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal in Virginia and a bare flagpole in Florida. Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church, had to see the sight for herself. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the absence of an edifice she long considered a symbol of oppression. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long, and we know that it's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph, 69. ""It didn't represent the blacks. It just represented the hard times back there a long time ago."" Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death in police custody in Minneapolis. Now, even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham took down the obelisk a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests. Crews were preparing to finish the job by pulling up the base. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state, which passed a law to protect Confederate icons after rebel monuments were challenged and removed following the killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the city of Birmingham, seeking to fine the city $25,000 for violating the state law. Mayor Randall Woodfin said earlier this week that the fine was more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Online fundraising drives have raised more than enough money to pay the fine. The state lawsuit does not specifically ask Birmingham to restore the monument. Work to remove the monument began Monday, which was Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him. Four people were arrested on criminal mischief charges, and the toppled statue was removed. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city's only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled ""Appomattox,"" it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying ""Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving."" In Birmingham, Rudolph saw the removal of the monument as unfinished business from decades ago. The more than 50-foot-tall (15-meter-tall) memorial to Confederate soldiers and sailors was located just blocks from the church where Rudolph was badly injured and her sister died when a bomb went off on a Sunday morning decades ago. ""The things that we were fighting for in the '60s aren't solved yet,"" said Rudolph, who testified against Ku Klux Klansmen convicted in the bombing. ""We shouldn't be treated the way they treat us."" ___ Associated Press writers Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama; and Matthew Barakat in Falls Church, Virginia; contributed to this report.

But when the Canadian prime minister was asked what he thought of President Trump's actions to quash a wave of protests across the U.S., Trudeau paused before responding – for 21 seconds as the cameras recorded his awkward silence. During a Tuesday news conference in front of his Ottawa residence, the prime minister fielded this question from a reporter: ""You've been reluctant to comment about the words and actions of the U.S. president. But we do have now Donald Trump calling for military action against protesters. We saw protesters tear-gassed yesterday to make way for a presidential photo-op. I'd like to ask you what you think about that. And, if you don't want to comment, what message do you think you're sending?"" Before answering, the prime minister, sporting a beard and shaggy hair since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, glanced down at his lectern, opened his mouth as if to speak — then paused, shifted his weight and uttered a barely audible ""um"" as birds chirped in the background. ""We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,"" he finally said. ""It is a time to pull people together, but it is a time to listen. ""It is a time to learn what injustices continue despite progress over years and decades. But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges,"" he said. ""That black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day,"" Trudeau continued. ""There is systemic discrimination in Canada, which means our systems treat Canadians of color, Canadians who are racialized, as differently than they do others."" Trudeau typically displays reticence on Trump's actions, keeping in mind the centrality of the U.S.-Canada relationship and its huge cross-border economic interdependence. Canada in recent days has seen relatively small, peaceful protests in solidarity with U.S. demonstrations that first erupted last week in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. By contrast, the protests in U.S. cities have typically been much larger and have frequently devolved into clashes between police and activists. The Canadian protests supporting Black Lives Matter have sprung up in Montreal, Halifax, Toronto and Regina, the provincial capital of Saskatchewan. At the protest in Regina on Tuesday, when a few hundred people gathered, one of the organizers, Faith Olanipekun, told the CBC that, ""A lot of people here think that Canada isn't racist."" ""So it's important for us to come out, voice our concerns and let people know that we are suffering in Canada just as much as people in the U.S. are suffering,"" Olanipekun said. ",0.0

The protests outside Liberty University were due, in part, to tweets made by university president Jerry Falwell, Jr., mocking Gov. Ralph Northam by suggesting the photo in the tweet — a man in blackface next to a man in a Ku Klux Klan costume — from Northam’s college yearbook, be placed on face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Marcus Tinsley with Liberty’s Campus Police brought the rest of his officers forward. “We’re going to come together,” Tinsley said to the crowd before looking back on the other campus policemen, “so intermingle with these people right here.” Tinsley later prayed over the group.

Some in the crowd didn’t take Tinsley’s gesture as genuine. “If the police really want to help us, they need to go and challenge the system that they’re a part of,” said Vicente Gonzalez, a Lynchburg native. Gonzalez said it’s going to take more than Tinsley’s prayer to fix what he calls systematic racism in Lynchburg. “He need to take what he did here today, and take action,” Gonzalez said. “We as a community need to hold him accountable, which is why I say we need to focus on our community.” The protesters left Liberty just before 8 p.m. because of the curfew, and made their way into Campbell County, where they continued to protest later into the evening.

We want you to continue making your voice heard.” Thousands of protesters remained in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood well after the abolished 9 p.m. curfew Wednesday. Demonstrators carried “Black Lives Matter” signs, called for cutting the police department’s budget and shifting the money to social programs, and chanted for officers to remove their riot gear. Washington Lt. Gov. Cyrus Habib tweeted that he was pleased Seattle had listened and reversed course. “Preemptive curfews were only making things worse. Other cities should do likewise,” he posted. ___ WASHINGTON — Demonstrators marched to the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday night, protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota and demanding that laws be changed to prevent more like it. Along their route from near the White House, there were troops in fatigues and officers from federal agencies keeping watch on the crowd. Barricades were put up around the Capitol, and the Capitol Police stood guard behind them. “We came here because they make laws here and we want the laws to change,” said Mohammed Wagdy, 26, of nearby Prince George’s County. As an 11 p.m. curfew in Washington neared, community activists urged the demonstrators to head home. Some did, but others said they were returning to the White House. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — A full autopsy of George Floyd, the handcuffed black man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police, provides several clinical details — including that Floyd had tested positive for COVID-19. The 20-page report released Wednesday by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office came with the family’s permission and after the coroner’s office released summary findings Monday that Floyd had a heart attack while being restrained by officers, and classified his May 25 death as a homicide. The report by Chief Medical Examiner Andrew Baker spelled out clinical details, including that Floyd tested positive for COVID-19 on April 3 but appeared asymptomatic. The report also noted Floyd’s lungs appeared healthy but he had some narrowing of arteries in the heart. The county’s earlier summary report listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use under “other significant conditions” but not under “cause of death.” The full report’s footnotes noted that signs of fentanyl toxicity can include “severe respiratory depression” and seizures. ___ WASHINGTON — As the National Guard and law enforcement officers stood guard near the White House, surveillance planes kept watch on protesters in the nation’s capital from the air. At one point Wednesday night, an FBI plane, an Army surveillance plane and a Park Police helicopter were circling overhead. The demonstrators broke up into two groups; one stayed at the White House, the other marched to the Capitol. Protesters held signs and chanted, but there were no indications of any confrontations with law enforcement. Hundreds of protesters stood face to face with military and federal officers who had formed a perimeter around Lafayette Park across from the White House. Military vehicles were parked on nearby streets, also blocking access. The demonstration was held to protest the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minnesota. Military police and law enforcement officers from a variety of federal agencies were out in force. A senior Defense official said at least 2,200 Guard members would be on the streets Wednesday. The South Carolina and Utah National Guards had forces in place. Bureau of Prisons personnel wore blue uniforms. There were also agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI hostage rescue team and the Secret Service. Washington’s mayor set an 11 p.m. curfew in the city after earlier restrictions the previous two nights. ___ LIBERTY, Mo. — Civil rights organizations on Wednesday called for the resignation of Kansas City Police Chief Rick Smith, hours after a group of mostly black pastors demanded changes to improve relations between police and the city’s minority community. The Urban League of Greater Kansas City, the NAACP’s Kansas City, Missouri branch, and More2 said in a statement that Smith should resign because of his handling of excessive force complaints and officer-involved shootings of black men. “Since November 2019, our Civil Rights organizations, in collaboration with faith and community leaders, have become increasingly appalled and very much concerned about Chief Smith’s questionable leadership of the Kansas City Police Department,” the coalition said in a statement. The group also criticized the city’s Board of Police Commissioners for allowing Smith to conduct internal investigations of officer-involved shootings and complaints of excessive force rather than calling in independent investigators. The police department should be under local control, officers must be required to wear body cameras and the city must dismantle the Office of Community Complaints, which has been criticized as ineffectual, the coalition said. A group of mostly black religious leaders made similar demands earlier Wednesday, but without calling for Smith’s resignation. Emanual Cleaver III, pastor at St. James United Methodist Church, said the pastors believed it was necessary to seek change because: “What happened to George Floyd was nothing new.” He said pastors “will take action” if the city doesn’t respond, though he declined to elaborate. Public relations officers for the department did not immediately respond to the demand that Smith resign. Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said her office was reviewing video of Kansas City police officers who pepper-sprayed two protesters and arrested one who was yelling at police during protests Monday night. Mayor Quinton Lucas said Tuesday that he reviewed videos that had been sent to him from people concerned about police actions, and asked the FBI and federal prosecutors to review any that might violate procedures or show misconduct. Kansas City has endured five days of protests over Floyd’s death while in police custody May 25 in Minneapolis. Peaceful daytime demonstrations devolved into violence. Police used tear gas on protesters for the first four nights before relative calm returned Tuesday night. ___ CANBERRA, Australia — Australia’s prime minister has urged Australians involved in George Floyd-related anti-racism protests around the world to be “extremely cautious.” Prime Minister Scott Morrison was commenting Thursday after Australian journalists came under attack while covering protests in Washington and London. “In terms of some of the violence ... that we’re seeing around the world today, for those Australians who find themselves in those situations, I would urge them to show great caution,” Morrison told reporters. “I would urge people to be extremely cautious. These are dangerous situations, people should exercise great care in where they’re placing themselves,” he added. Australia’s ambassador to the United States has complained about two police officers in riot gear lashing Channel 7 journalist Amelia Brace and camera operator Timothy Meyers with a shield and baton on Monday. The network’s news director, Craig McPherson, described the attack as “nothing short of wanton thuggery.” The officers have been placed on administrative leave while their conduct is investigated. Two Nine Network television crews also came under attack from crowd members while reporting Wednesday on protests in London, the network reported. ___ CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The police department in North Carolina’s largest city is coming under criticism after a video posted to social media appeared to show officers using chemical agents on demonstrators who were boxed in while protesting the death of George Floyd. The video was recorded Tuesday night by Justin LaFrancois, co-founder and publisher of the alternative Charlotte newspaper Queen City Nerve. He said officers fired tear gas and flash-bangs from behind the protesters, and in front of them as well. He also said officers perched on top of buildings were firing pepper balls down on the crowd. “We were completely trapped,” LaFrancois said. “There was one way to get out, and half of the group did go out that way through the tear gas and through the pepper balls. But for the rest of us, the only route of escape ... was to pull up a gate on the parking structure that we were pressed up against.” LaFrancois said people tried to squeeze under the 6-inch opening in the gate and find safety. But as those people looked for an exit from the parking deck, he said officers began firing pepper balls after they entered the deck from the other side. “They were relentless in not allowing us to leave the area that they were trying to get us to leave,” LaFrancois said. “It was the most extreme action that I had seen taken. It was the first time that I was actually in fear for my life.” Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said on Twitter they are looking into the incident. “We are internally reviewing the circumstances that developed this evening on 4th Street to ensure policy and protocol were followed,” the police department tweeted Tuesday. ___ SAN FRANCISCO — A man suspected of robbing a pharmacy in the San Francisco Bay area was fatally shot by officers who thought a hammer he was carrying in his waistband was a firearm, police said Wednesday. Details of the shooting were revealed even as some California counties and cities began plans to end curfews after days of largely peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis. Sean Monterrosa, 22, of San Francisco is the first confirmed death at the hands of law enforcement related to smash-and-grabs and protests in California since Floyd’s death. Vallejo Police Chief Shawny Williams said officers were responding to calls of looting at a Walgreens early Tuesday when the shooting occurred. Officers said Monterrosa began running toward a car when he suddenly stopped, got on his knees and placed his hands above his waist, revealing what appeared to be the butt of a firearm in his waistband. An officer shot five times through a car window, striking him once. “The intent was to stop the looting and arrest any perpetrators if necessary. The officers reacted to a perceived threat,” Williams said. John Burris, an attorney for the family, said he is appalled police would shoot at a person who was on his knees with his hands raised. ___ OGDEN, Utah — A criminal justice professor who wrote an inflammatory series of tweets during the nationwide protests said Wednesday he has resigned. Scott Senjo told The Associated Press in an email that he agrees his tweets were “simply wrong” and his resignation from Weber State University would be effective immediately. Last weekend, he tweeted at a black reporter who said he had been hit by New York City police: “Excellent. If I was the cop, you wouldn’t be able to tweet.” He also expressed support for damage done to CNN headquarters in Atlanta. In response to another tweet showing a New York City police car driving into people, Senjo commented: “That’s not how I would have driven the car into the crowd.” Senjo said his posts were part of the “oftentimes vulgar, extreme back-and-forth that can occur on Twitter,” but he now realizes they were “far beyond the realm of acceptable university policy as well as acceptable social norms.” Weber State University has condemned the messages as “abhorrent” and opened an investigation to determine if other measures would be taken to ensure campus safety. The school had placed him on paid leave Tuesday to conduct a review and did not ask him to resign, officials said in a statement. Senjo had been a professor at the college in Ogden since 2000. ___ CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro railed against President Donald Trump while expressing solidarity with the family of George Floyd, whose death in Minneapolis has sparked protests and street violence across the United States. Maduro on Wednesday accused Trump of turning the U.S. military against his own people. He spoke on state TV at a ceremony decorating Venezuelan soldiers credited with fending off a recent attack that the socialist leader blames on Trump. Maduro also extended Venezuela’s solidarity with blacks and young people in the U.S. He says they are taking to the streets demanding an end to racism and police violence. The White House has launched a campaign to oust Maduro. The U.S. and other nations as well as human rights groups condemn Maduro for employing brutal force and torture to silence Venezuelans who oppose the socialist government. ___ MINNEAPOLIS — The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has sent a national response team to Minneapolis and St. Paul to help investigate fires set during unrest following the death of George Floyd. Local and state authorities requested the team’s help in investigating about 100 business fires in Minneapolis and about 35 in St. Paul. Special Agent in Charge William Henderson of the ATF’s St. Paul Field Division said in a statement Wednesday “the cause of these fires is quite obvious. The task at hand now is to determine who is responsible.” The team arrived earlier this week.",0.0

Protesters broke the glass Tuesday night in reaction to George Floyd's death while in police custody on May 25 in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) NEW YORK – Peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd continued Wednesday in New York City, but an early curfew, drenching rain and refined police tactics appeared to have stopped some of the destruction of previous nights. Some critics said the calm came at a high price, as the city was forced to grind to a halt at 8 p.m., bridges were closed to traffic and police arrested dozens of orderly people for violating the curfew. About an hour after the deadline to get off the street, officers began moving in on crowds of demonstrators in Manhattan and Brooklyn, at times blasting people with pepper spray or using batons to shove people who didn't move fast enough. When one demonstrator asked an officer why he was being taken into custody, an Associated Press reporter heard the officer reply, “Curfew violater. You didn’t hear the news?” NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan said about 60 people were arrested near Central Park out of a large band of protesters who had marched from near the mayor's residence, Gracie Mansion. Police moved in just before a heavy rain began. “When we have these big crowds, especially in this area, especially where we’ve had the looting, no more tolerance. They have to be off the street. An 8 o’clock curfew, we gave them until 9 o’clock, and there was no indication that they were going to leave these streets,” Monahan said, noting that the crowd was allowed to disperse once arrests began, and most did. City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who attended a rally in downtown Brooklyn, expressed outrage that peaceful demonstrations were broken up. “I can’t believe what I just witnessed & experienced,"" Williams wrote on twitter. He called the use of force on nonviolent protesters ""disgusting.” As the evening deepened, there were few reports of the mayhem that had occurred on several days of demonstrations, when protesters burned police vehicles and showered officers with debris. Gone also were the roving bands of people who smashed their way into scores of stores and stole merchandise Sunday and Monday nights. Protesters also appeared to react more calmly to police attempts to break up crowds, a contrast to the early days of the protests where attempts to break up crowds were sometimes met with thrown objects. At Gracie Mansion, demonstrators were kneeling in a moment of silence when alarms rang on cellphones, warning that the curfew was approaching. “This means a lot to me, as a black woman,” said protester Stella Mbah, who kept marching after the curfew passed. “There are so many things police are doing wrong to us black people."" Another demonstrator, Lisa Horton, said charges announced Wednesday against three other Minneapolis police officers in connection to Floyd’s death were a step, but she was protesting because she feels more needs to change. “There’s been progress, but are we at a point where we can all celebrate? No,” she said, calling for “radical change” in the criminal justice system. Tuesday night's protests had also been mostly peaceful, prompting Mayor Bill de Blasio to declare that an early curfew was working. “Last night we took a step forward in moving out of this difficult period we’ve had the last few days and moving to a better time,” he said at a morning news briefing. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was critical of the police response on prior nights, said the city Tuesday “was much, much better than the night before.” “It worked. We got results,"" Cuomo said. ""Let’s just remember what we did last night and keep that going.” De Blasio rejected President Donald Trump's urging and Cuomo's offer to send in the National Guard to stop the ransacking of stores, saying the NYPD was best suited for the task. Trump warned in a Fox News Radio interview that if city officials “don’t get their act straightened out, I will solve it. I’ll solve it fast,” but didn’t say what action he might take. Around Manhattan, even in parts of the city that hadn't seen the damage and thefts, businesses had boarded up windows Wednesday as a precaution. That was the case at Saks Fifth Avenue, where a line of tattooed men with well-mannered dogs guarded the boarded windows wrapped in chain-link and razor wire. The nightly curfews will remain in effect through at least Sunday, with the city planning to lift it at the same time it enters the first phase of reopening after more than two months of shutdowns because of the coronavirus. The marches were part of a wave of protests across the country since the May 25 death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck and left it there even after he lost consciousness. Police said they arrested about 280 people on Tuesday, compared with 700 the previous night. In all, more than 2,000 people have been arrested, the NYPD said. Wednesday, prosecutors also charged a man with shooting at an occupied police vehicle in Queens. Neither officer in the vehicle was wounded. No demonstration was underway in the area and the man's motive in shooting at the vehicle was unclear. De Blasio condemned police for roughing up journalists covering the protests, including two from the AP who were shoved, cursed at and told to go home by officers Tuesday night despite press being considered “essential workers” allowed to be on the streets. “There should be no condition under which any journalist is detained by the police of this city or any city in the United States of America, period,” de Blasio said, calling for an investigation. Shea said officers were “doing the best we can under difficult circumstances,” adding that some people stopped by police lied about being journalists. “We’re not perfect, we do the best we can in a situation,"" he said. ___ Jennifer Peltz and Jim Mustian in New York City and Marina Villeneuve in Albany contributed to this report. ___ On Twitter: Follow Michael Sisak at twitter.com/mikesisak and Jake Seiner at twitter.com/Jake_Seiner",0.0

(AP Photo/Steven Senne) WASHINGTON – Prosecutors charged three more police officers Wednesday in the death of George Floyd and filed a new, tougher charge against the officer at the center of the case, delivering a victory to protesters who have filled the streets from coast to coast to fight police brutality and racial injustice. The most serious charge was filed against Derek Chauvin, who was caught on video pressing his knee to Floyd’s neck and now must defend himself against an accusation of second-degree murder. The three other officers at the scene were charged for the first time with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. All four were fired last week. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to four decades in prison. Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Those charges still stand. The new second-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death without intent while committing another felony, namely third-degree assault. It carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison, compared with a maximum of 25 years for third-degree murder. The other officers — Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao — face the same maximum penalties for aiding and abetting. All three men were in custody by Wednesday evening. Chauvin was arrested last week and is still being held. The multiple charges against each officer would offer a jury more options to find them guilty. The charges were sought by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who called the protests unleashed by the death “dramatic and necessary” and said Floyd “should be here and he is not.” “His life had value, and we will seek justice,” said Ellison, who cautioned that winning convictions would be hard and said that public pressure had no bearing on his decisions. Hundreds of protesters were in New York City's Washington Square Park when the charges were announced. “It’s not enough,” protester Jonathan Roldan said, insisting all four officers should have been charged from the start. “Right now, we’re still marching because it’s not enough that they got arrested. There needs to be systematic change.” Ben Crump, an attorney for Floyd’s family, called it “a bittersweet moment” and “a significant step forward on the road to justice.” Crump said Elison had told the family he would continue his investigation into Floyd’s death and upgrade the charge to first-degree murder if warranted. The move by prosecutors punctuated an unprecedented week in modern American history, in which largely peaceful protests took place in communities of all sizes but were rocked by bouts of violence, including deadly attacks on officers, rampant thefts and arson in some places. Nationwide, more than 9,000 have been arrested in connection with unrest. At least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, speaking after the new charges were announced, said the state and nation need to “seize the moment” and use the wrenching events of the past week to confront the effects of racism, including unequal educational and economic opportunities. “I think this is probably our last shot, as a state and as a nation, to fix this systemic issue,” he said at a news conference. Also Wednesday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office released the full autopsy report on Floyd, which noted he had previously tested positive for COVID-19, but was apparently asymptomatic. The report was released with the family’s permission after summary findings Monday that said he had a heart attack while being restrained by officers. President Donald Trump has pushed the nation’s governors to take a hard line against the violence. He again tweeted Wednesday: “LAW & ORDER!” An overpowering security force — including officers from the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, the Secret Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Prisons and, according to a senior defense official, at least 2,200 National Guard soldiers — was out in force Wednesday as thousands of peaceful protesters demonstrated in the nation’s capital. Some remained near the White House while others marched toward the Capitol building. Military vehicles were parked on streets near the White House, and an array of agencies kept watch from the air. An FBI plane, an Army surveillance plane and a Park Police helicopter circled overhead. At one point near the White House, protesters began singing “Amazing Grace"" as they knelt in view of law enforcement officers in riot gear. “We are not going anywhere!” they chanted. There were no signs of confrontations. Protester Jade Jones, 30, said the demonstrations would continue despite the new charges. ""That’s the least they could do,” said Jones, who had been attending Washington protests for days. “It’s not going to wipe away 400 years of pain.” “We are glad there are additional charges, but that doesn’t mean justice has been served,"" she said. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. In New York City, where high-end stores were looted in earlier days, some retailers fortified their property. At the luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue, windows were boarded up, then covered in chain-link fencing and razor wire. The front of the store was guarded by a line of tattooed men with dogs. There was scuffling in some parts of the city Wednesday night, but no signs of major clashes between protesters and police. The protests have also taken root overseas. In Greece, police fired tear gas after young people attacked them Wednesday outside the U.S. Embassy in Athens. Some 4,000 protesters had been peaceful until near the end of the demonstration, when some threw gasoline bombs and stones at police. No injuries or arrests were reported. Other protests were held Wednesday in London, Helsinki, Rotterdam and Bogota, among other cities. The anger over Floyd's death has spilled into an array of racial issues across the U.S. In Philadelphia, for example, a statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo was removed by the city Wednesday after repeatedly being targeted by vandals. Rizzo presided over a police force widely accused of racism and brutality in the 1970s. In Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam was expected to announce plans Thursday for the removal of an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Richmond’s prominent Monument Avenue, a senior administration official told The Associated Press. The statue in the former Confederate capital has been the target of vandalism during the protests. ___ Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

Biden could lock down the nomination within the next week as West Virginia and Georgia hold primaries. On Tuesday, voters across America were forced to navigate curfews, health concerns and National Guard troops "" waiting in line hours after polls closed in some cases "" after election officials dramatically reduced the number of in-person voting sites to minimize the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Biden and President Donald Trump easily swept their respective primary contests that ranged from Maryland to Montana and featured the night's biggest prize: Pennsylvania. The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the monthslong state-by-state primary season. Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March. Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in 'militarized zones' because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. 'Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their Election Day,' Kramer said. Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn't talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as 'more interested in power than in principle.' Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party. The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank, who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests. Some voters said Trump's increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. 'Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,' Autiello said. 'So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.' Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines. 'We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,' said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday 'to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.' Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year. In Iowa, Republican Rep. Steve King, known nationally for controversial remarks, lost his bid to be nominated for a 10th term to state Sen. Randy Feenstra. House Republicans stripped King of his committee assignments in 2019 after comments that seemed to defend white nationalism, providing fuel for Feenstra's argument that King was no longer an effective representative for the 4th District. In a New Mexico race for an open House seat, ex-CIA operative Valerie Plame lost the Democratic primary to attorney Teresa Leger Fernandez, a professional advocate for Native American communities and voting rights issues. A first-time candidate for public office, Plame harnessed her fame as the operative whose secret identity was exposed shorty after her diplomat husband disputed U.S. intelligence used to justify the 2003 Iraq invasion. And in Washington, Janeese Lewis George, a self-identified democratic socialist, upset incumbent Brandon Todd in the Democratic primary for a seat on the city council. Todd was an ally of Mayor Muriel Bowser, who previously held the seat. ___ Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi in Providence, R.I., and Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, 'Ground Game.""",0.0

Seeking to avoid any hint of the rioting and violence that has convulsed cities around the U.S. in the wake of Floyd’s death, the young organizer of the event — a rising senior at Halifax County High School — has made it clear that weapons, aggressive action and threatening words are not welcome.  It is set to begin at 6 p.m. at Constitution Square, where protestors are asked to gather before marching the sidewalks in town with signs to protest recent killings of African Americans by police and others.  “I want it to be totally peaceful,” said Nevaeh Hodges, who recently finished up her junior year at HCHS. “I don’t even want there to be any profanity. I don’t want it to be negative toward anybody. I want to spread love, not hate.”  Hodges, the daughter of Shanetta Crews-Hodges and Kenneth Hodges II of South Boston, said she first reached out to a circle of friends about holding a protest on the sidewalk in front of the high school. “I was only expecting 10 or 15 people would be interested in it,” she said.  But after floating the idea in private Facebook groups, the 17-year-old said she felt encouraged to communicate more openly in inviting people to participate. Through social media, including her personal Facebook page, she has received mostly positive feedback on holding the local Black Lives Matter rally.  Hodges said most of her feedback has come from African-American youths like herself — but not entirely. “There are a lot of white people who have reached out to me to say they would like to participate,” she said. “It’s been diverse.”  She also has heard the sentiment that such an event isn’t necessary here: “Oh, this doesn’t really happen in Halifax, so why do we need to protest?”  From reading social media posts of people in the area, Hodges said she has come to believe police treatment of local African Americans is a problem — from many accounts that black people have offered to the question, “When did you first experience racism?”  Even if encounters with police aren’t confrontational or violent, they can leave an impression, she said.  “Being black, regardless of where you live, in all probability you’ve had a situation with police where you felt probably there could be a danger. Not that you’re always in danger, but [the possibility] is always there.”  In a Facebook post explaining the ground rules for the protest, Hodges says anyone exhibiting violent behavior will be asked to leave. “This is PEACEFUL protest, not a riot,” she wrote. Masks are required, and participants will be asked to socially distance.  She also asks for no hate speech and “please, leave all weapons at home!”  Signs will be available for those without their own.  Hodges said there are no plans for now to have people speak at Constitution Square because she wants the protestors to walk the sidewalks, chanting and holding signs to express outrage at the deaths of Floyd and others — including, in recent days, the killing of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia by a white father and son with law enforcement ties, and Louisville medic Breonna Taylor, who was shot to death by city police inside her apartment.  The death of Floyd — who was pinned to pavement by Minneapolis police for almost nine minutes, with officer Derek Chauvin crushing Floyd’s head under his knee — has inflamed the country, with thousands of people arrested in street protests. Chauvin has been charged with third degree murder and manslaughter, and the other three officers who took part in pinning the handcuffed man to the ground have been fired from the city police department.  South Boston Police Lt. Randy Redd said Sunday that the town department is aware of the planned protest, but he said the protestors have not gotten a permit to hold an event at Constitution Square. Redd said that as of Friday, when he left the office, no one had contacted SBPD about a gathering at Constitution Square. Redd said he has been in contact with a different individual about holding a demonstration, but that person indicated no date, time or place in mind.  Redd said the police department is “still trying to sort out the details” of what is planned Tuesday and said he did not want to comment further. He declined to offer a statement on the Minneapolis situation.  Hodges said Sunday that she called the police station on Saturday to inform police of the plans for the protest, and she will follow up today with SBPD. However, she said Constitution Square is simply the gathering place and the march will take place on sidewalks — a constitutionally protected activity that does not require a permit.  Hodges said she reached that conclusion after visiting the website of the American Civil Liberties Union, which indeed notes that “[y]ou don’t need a permit to march in the streets or on sidewalks, as long as marchers don’t obstruct car or pedestrian traffic. If you don’t have a permit, police officers can ask you to move to the side of a street or sidewalk to let others pass or for safety reasons.”  The right to demonstrate is “strongest in what are known as ‘traditional public forums,’ such as streets, sidewalks, and parks,” the ACLU advises.  Hodges, a cheerleader at the high school, said she has never done anything like this before, although she had taken part in summer leadership programs through HCHS. Her ambition is to become a lawyer, possibly focusing on criminal justice or business law. “I’ve always wanted to be a defense attorney, but my family has businesses” — including 2016 Chamber Business of the Year H&M Logging — “so I may want to do that.”    Tell-a-Friend | Submit a Comment 72 Comments Facts are more whites are killed by police than blacks. Unfortunately the police deal with criminals and life threatening situations on a daily basis, and have to use deadly force at times. They kill about a 1000 people a year, which is a small percentage of their encounters/arrests, etc. Whites top the list of those killed by police. These are indisputable facts.  What happened to G Floyd was terrible, but it is an isolated incident, it just gets hyped by the media, plain and simple. Comments It isn't going to devalue the lives of any white people if there is a peaceful protest. As long as things remain peaceful, let my black brothers and sisters protest the racial injustice they encounter far too often. Statistics don't mean anything when you are talking about actual human beings. Say his name. He was a person...not just a number. We are all people, not just numbers. Say our names! Comments Peaceful? Turn on your T.V. lately?  This notion that there is systemic racism rampant throughout this country is nonsense.  Stats mean everything - facts don't lie. George Floyd was killed by another person. Why does it always have to be ""black guy killed by white guy""? A white killing a black man is RARE when looking at stats. I urge you to do some research and look at who is responsible for the overwhelming majority of murders where the victim was a black man.  As for the protest, as long as it is peaceful it is your right to do so. Nobody has an issue with peaceful protests. Comments I commend Ms. Hodges for her sense of community and responsibility in organizing this peaceful demonstration and exercising her First Amendment rights. She sounds like an outstanding young lady with a bright future ahead of her. Comments @tired of media: That's an awful lot of words for you're scared of POC having the same basic rights as you. And don't come at me with ""systemic racism doesn't exist,"" because even YOU know it does.  My comments were specifically targeted toward Halifax County's planned peaceful protest. Again, statistics mean nothing when it's your children being threatened or dying. Comments @tired of racism - pls provide ONE example of systemic racism today. Comments @Tired of racism...  Since you like stats so much, here is one that nobody in the left wing media NEVER mentions..  2019 10,000,000 arrests were made. 1004 Killed by police. 41 were unarmed. 19 were white. 9 were black.  These are statistics from the FBI's yearly crime report. The facts are undisputed.  Police are NOT hunting young black men. It is a myth. Comments George Floyd...there is an example of systemic racism, right there. He would not have died if he was white. Donald Trump calling black neighborhoods infested and calling countries inhabited by POC sh*tholes... this is the leader of the free world...racism at the highest level. You believe in trickle-down economics so much, but not trickle-down racism? And you are clearly from a law enforcement background to keep beating those dead horse statistics...AND THAT'S WHAT IS SO SCARY!! A law enforcement background with such hate for another race. When your white daughters and sons become an OD statistic, maybe you'll feel differently about why numbers don't matter, but lives do. Comments If you need more examples: the Justice Department found that African-Americans were pulled over 30% more than their white or Hispanic counterparts when all other factors were relatively the same. Hate groups have increased 400% since Barack Obama was inaugurated in 2009. For every black person convicted of a killing, they are 1.5X more likely to receive the death penalty than a white person convicted of the same crime. How is this not systemic? And you may be saying, ""well, it is all in the defense you can mount in court."" Which we all know costs money, and let's not get started on the nearly insurmountable wealth gap...which is another product of systemic racism. We cannot obtain wealth if we are being kept away from the highest level jobs. Even those of us who are qualified can barely get a foot in the door sometimes. I will forgive you for not knowing these things, as you have never experienced them. But now you do, so ignorance can no longer be your excuse. Comments @TOR  Not in law enforcement, but I respect those that are. They have terrible pay and die every year. They have to go into the worst situations daily, especially in the inner cities, that are sh*tholes for sure - crime, drugs, gangs, violence.  Funny you don't like my stats but turn around and find stats that fit your narrative - can't have it both ways.  No evidence that racism played a part in Mr Floyds death. If so, please disclose it. He was a victim of poor policing. FBI stats show that 19 unarmed WHITE people last year were killed by police, that is TWICE as many as blacks. Also 89 police were gunned down in the line of duty. Comments You asked for examples of systemic racism. I didn't ""find"" examples to fit my narrative. They exist and you asked for them. To quote you: ""pls provide ONE example of systemic racism today."" Don't ask for what you can't handle. Derek Chauvin had a history of violence against African-Americans. Comments You didn't provide and example of systemic racism. The cop that killed Mr Floyd was just a bad person, how do you know it was race related? Everytime something bad happens to a black person, it is not because of their race.  Again, more unarmed whites are killed by police than unarmed blacks. Facts are facts. Comments It is clear that you are incapable of reading as there is a whole list of examples I provided above. Go ahead, look up there. There are at least THREE examples I provided for you. I'll wait while you look back. And then, just admit that you hate POC and are part of the problem. No one is disputing your statistics...and good on you for learning how to use Google. But don't try to gaslight me and tell me that I did not provide irrefutable statistics as well, clear as day, posted above. It makes YOU look insane. Comments And furthermore, if you are concerned about your white, unarmed brethren being killed by police, maybe they should ""not have been doing wrong/committing crimes,"" ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps,"" and all the other things that white people tell black people to do. It would seem that we are not as different as you would like to believe, but yet you still treat us as second-class citizens. Comments Peaceful protest is acceptable. When they turn into looting rampages the police are left with little choice but to act. Those business owners pay taxes and deserve protection. A lot of this stuff is brought about in a person carries them self. It does not pay to get loud and have an attitude with the police when you are stopped on the street and pulled over. In order to get respect, you must give respect. If you look at the lifestyle let by many in the black community, you don't have to look hard to see that respect of self is totally lacking. Many problems would be solved if you started seeing 2 parent black families. many children are raised by the street and we see how wonderful that turns out. Comments @TOR  I don't hate POC, don't hate anyone for that matter, I am educated, and can read. I am just saying that racism is NOT a huge problem in our system. Are there people who hate someone due to their race or religion? YEP. But in our basic system it doesn't exit. You simply can't cry racism every single time. It just gets old. And I am not concerned about white people getting in trouble with the law. Usually if you behave you won't encounter police. Again, the police have a tough job to do and they interact with violent criminals daily. It sucks. Sometimes, as humans do, they make terrible mistakes. It is NOT ALWAYS race related. Comments Okay...how can you say systemic racism doesn't exist, but say statistics don't lie? Whose statistics are lying? Whose aren't? I pulled mine from the DOJ...you pulled yours from the FBI. Who's lying? The federal government? Which sector? The one enforcing the laws or the ones interpreting the laws? I'm not arguing; I'm honestly trying to understand at this point. I'm honestly trying to understand how white people cannot see there is a problem. ""If you aren't outraged, you aren't listening."" ""Privilege is when it's not a problem because it doesn't personally affect you."" Comments Maybe police stop more blacks because they are committing more of the crime. Cops aren't pulling over many 65 year old Asians for a reason. Name one instance here in Halifax, where systemic racism has hurt a black. We have black Dr's(I go to one), we have black teachers, coaches, admins, police, and a black mayor. The country has black congressman and senators, AND we had a bi-racial President. Sure doesn't look like there is a racism problem to me. Comments It's terribly sad that you think because it ""doesn't happen here"" that it doesn't happen. By that standard, 9/11 never happened because it didn't happen in Halifax County. The moon landing...Hilter's Death...Obama's inauguration...none of those ever happened because they didn't take place in Halifax County. Do you see how ridiculous you sound? I gave you statistics directly from the DOJ on how more blacks are pulled over when other factors are the same...not when they are ""committing more crimes"" than whites. That means that if there are two cars in an otherwise empty parking lot, STATISTICALLY,an officer of the law is more likely to approach and question the black driver vs. the white one. How are you going to tell me that I refuse to accept the statistics you posted (which, I don't refute, btw), but you are unwilling to accept irrefutable statistics I post because they don't fit your agenda of hating brown people? Gtfoh Comments @TOR  ""By that standard, 9/11 never happened because it didn't happen in Halifax County. The moon landing...Hilter's Death...Obama's inauguration...none of those ever happened because they didn't take place in Halifax County. "" Horrible analogies - LOL - You must be in middle school or something...  SYSTEMIC Racism does not exist nation wide - you know it, I know it, EVERYONE knows it. I hear various people in the media say stuff like ""blacks are being hunted everyday in this country"" - the implication is that ""whitey"" is doing the hunting. The cold hard facts simple refute that totally, yet they keep on saying it.  #1 cause of death of black males ages 15-34 is, you guessed it, being killed by another black male. Not by police, not by a random white dude, but by another black person. Check the stats on Chicago's murder rate, who are the victims, and who is doing the killing. Then try Baltimore, then Richmond...  Why is it Asians don't have a problem with police?

Hundreds of Halifax County residents responded.  Chanting “I can’t breathe,” “Say their names,” and “No justice, no peace,” the huge crowd — black and white, young and old, many carrying signs and wearing t-shirts declaring that Black Lives Matter — filled Constitution Square for a 90-minute rally that featured remarks from mostly young speakers, punctuated by prayer, rap beats and song.  The event peacefully tapped the sense of outrage and dismay that has erupted with the killing of Floyd, whose death at the hands of Minneapolis police has sparked demonstrations around the country and convulsed cities where cops have clashed with crowds, vandals and looters have stirred mayhem and normal life has come to a standstill.  In contrast, the event in South Boston, under sunny skies, took on more of an air of a unity rally. In addition to the student speakers, Halifax County Sheriff Fred Clark and South Boston Police Chief Jim Binner each offered brief remarks, acknowledging the crowd’s concerns and pledging to fairly administer their duties as law enforcement officers.  Hodges, after introducing herself early in the event, spoke later for several minutes before asking the crowd to march in a loop around Constitution Square for nearly nine minutes — the span of time that Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin, charged with third degree murder in Floyd’s death, pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck, pinning the 46-year-old man to the city street where he died.  “The most important thing to take from this protest today is that racism is the biggest disease in America,” Hodges told the crowd. “And in order for each and every one of us to have a better future for our children and our children’s children and the children after that, we have to make the change now.  “I’m specifically talking to people my age when I say this, but you have to speak out. You are never too young to speak out. I mean, I’m 17 years old and I’m doing this, so each and every one of you can do the same exact thing.”  Hodges, a cheerleader at HCHS, spoke of growing up with the sense that she didn’t fit into any particular crowd — a segue for her to praise the multiracial makeup of the Constitution Square crowd. Proclaiming “we are the solution” and “we are the cure,” she said she feels this way “because I see black people, I see white people, I see police officers, I see people of all races, genders, occupations coming together.  “We all need to fight. And when I say fight I do mean peacefully.” She added, “We need to fight with our voices, we need to fight with our votes, and we need to fight with education. It is your job, if you’re here today, to go out and educate other people and tell them this is wrong, this is a problem, we have to stop this … to say, I was at a protest and black lives matter and you need to know this today.”  Friends of Hodges joined her on stage to hold up signs listing African Americans who have died in high-profile encounters with police — names that include Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Botham Jean and others — while other local black youths recited poetry and rap lyrics expressing their anguish over the racism they see and experience in their own lives.  “Beautiful brown skin made as a gift from the sun, yet because of it, you are seen as less,” rhymed one speaker. “Beautiful black girl in a world made against you, you are power, you are strength, you are knowledge, you are nature, you are a queen.”  Richard Edmunds wrote a rap verse that touched on the black struggle in American history and since 2016 with the election of Donald Trump: “That’s when pride in my country was something that’s hard to feel,” he chanted. “They expect me to be violent but that’s not part of my deal. My weapon is my voice and my heart will not be concealed.  “We have a strong voice and let our words be delivered. I stand with every race so we can knock down this pillar. So maybe one day racism is washed down a river.”  Ken Warfield, chaplain for the South Boston Police Department and pastor of Fork Baptist Church in Scottsburg, spoke of growing up as a white youth in a predominately African America neighborhood in the City of Baltimore, derided by President Trump in a recent Tweet as an “infested mess” that “no human being would want to live in.” Countered Warfield: “Baltimore is not a rathole. It’s full of good people.  “When Christ looks at people as a pastor, okay, he looks at the heart. He doesn’t look at skin color. He wasn’t this blond haired blue eyed [person] everybody thinks he was. Jesus Christ loves people. And I’m so thankful to see all of you here. None of you have guns and I appreciate that. I don’t think that’s what we need here today.”  An exception to Warfield’s comment was some half dozen members of a self-styled local militia, carrying military assault style weapons. Grouped quietly in a spot next to Main Street, at the edge of the square, they drew little notice during the event.  “Stick to what you’re doing. Keep the peace,” said Warfield to the sound of cheers from the crowd. “This whole Black Lives Matter matters to Jesus, too. Lives matter to Christ. We’ve got to come together and understand that we’re one people. We have one heart.”  Making some of the most direct references to police killings of African Americans was Ashton Burton of South Boston, who graduated in May from HCHS and will attend American University in Washington, D.C. later this year. Burton, a volunteer for the Joe Biden for President campaign, choked up as he spoke of African Americans have “been murdered on account of race.  “No American should live in fear. No American should be afraid to jog, to listen to music, or sit in their own home,” said Burton. “No American should have to say, ‘I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe. The most basic right of a human — breath — should never be taken away because of someone’s skin. No American should be killed or profiled or attacked all because they are black.  “It is time to stop turning a blind eye to the injustices that communities of color face. It is time for all Americans to face what is happening to black communities around this country. It is long past time to recognize that Black Lives Matter.”  (Editor's note: The original estimate of the crowd size at Tuesday's rally in South Boston, 700 people, has been revised and updated.)

Rosenstein told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he relied on lower-level investigators and attorneys to do the right thing in preparing applications for the secret court that authorizes surveillance on Americans. Now, he said, he recognizes via the subsequent investigations that those officials did not do the right thing — and accordingly, Rosenstein said he wouldn't have signed the application. The former deputy attorney general defended the overall need for an investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election and said he stood by its findings and much of its work. But he also acknowledged that it has since become clear he and other Justice Department leaders were acting upon incomplete information. In the case of former Trump aide Carter Page, Rosenstein said he remembered an application for renewal, one that that had been submitted before, and one that he then believed made a cogent case to continue the surveillance. ""My recollection of it was that it was actually fairly persuasive,"" he said. GOP vows more investigation of Russia investigation Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went ahead with a session Wednesday scheduled before the flare in protests and violence that followed the death of a Minneapolis man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in an incident that reignited long-simmering anger at police in cities across the country. The political context has evolved; Republicans want to tie former Vice President Joe Biden into what they call the abuses of power from the end of the Obama era. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said what he called the ""Obama-Biden administration"" had done ""went right up to the very top"" and was worse than the abuses of President Richard Nixon. Cruz also called Rosenstein ""grossly negligent."" He and Republicans sought answers about what Rosenstein and other Justice Department leaders knew at the time they were making fateful decisions about the FBI's investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which sought to hinder Hillary Clinton and help elect then-candidate Donald Trump. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., rejected Cruz's comparison between Obama and Nixon and said it would ""never stand the test of time."" She also said Graham was wasting everyone's time now. ""I have made it very clear that I think that it is absurd we are having this hearing."" Strange days Rosenstein found himself in the center of a political vortex in the spring of 2017, not long after he'd been nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. His boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was a Trump loyalist and had recused himself from the Russian matter. The president had fired FBI Director James Comey. In the midst of that febrile atmosphere, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as a special counsel and continue the Russia investigation. ""I was concerned the public would not have confidence in the investigation and that the acting FBI director [at the time] was not the right person to lead it,"" Rosenstein told senators on Wednesday. ""I decided appointment of special counsel was the best way to complete the investigation and promote public confidence in the conclusions."" Re-look after re-look has verified Mueller's findings about the Russian interference, but the work of the FBI and Justice Department wasn't found to be problem-free. Issues with the FBI investigators involved and their dealings within officialdom, especially with the secret court that oversees government surveillance, have embarrassed the top levels of federal law enforcement. Longtime target Many Republicans have faulted Rosenstein since his earliest days over his appointment of Mueller. Now, Graham brought Rosenstein back into center stage at a time when Trump and other allies want to link Biden with intelligence collection that involved members of the Trump camp. Graham said he also intends to conduct more interviews and hearings about the investigation, including with planned subpoenas. One future witness could include the former deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, Graham said. ""We're going to get to the bottom of it ... this stinks,"" Graham said. ""This is a sad episode on the history of the FBI."" Biden's camp has rejected the idea there were any abuses and pointed out that there was no way for administration officials to single out Americans in intelligence reporting because their names were hidden, or masked. They were only identified after requests for more information about who was talking with existing targets, Biden's campaign said. That practice is legal and takes place thousands of times per year. Trump and allies have made it the basis of political attacks against Biden and others from that era, as Cruz repeated at Wednesday's hearing. Biden, in turn, has blasted Trump and Republicans for what he calls their attempt to distract attention from the most pressing challenges of the day — first the coronavirus pandemic and now the national unrest over police violence. ""Sen. Graham sold his conscience in exchange for a better shot at winning his primary,"" a spokesman for Biden's campaign said Democrats, who are in the minority on the Senate Judiciary Committee, took up that theme on Wednesday, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. She also restated that the findings and much of the work of the Mueller era have been validated. Feinstein emphasized with Rosenstein that the infamous, never-verified Russia dossier was not used as the basis to charge anyone. And Rosenstein underlined what he called the important need to conduct investigations that might not necessarily lead to charges — and that in the case of the Mueller era, no Americans ultimately were charged with conspiring with the Russians who attacked the election. Republicans argue the mere fact of a continued investigation into Page — after evidence surfaced they argue should have quashed it — is improper even though Page was never charged. In Rosenstein's case, he signed a request to continue surveillance on Page based on work product that has since been repudiated by internal investigators and the secret surveillance court. Those details didn't become clear to the public — or Rosenstein, he said on Wednesday — until later. Graham said he accepts that explanation but wants to know why information being gleaned by lower-level investigators wasn't making its way to the leadership of the FBI or Justice. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., tried to emphasize with Rosenstein that although the Page surveillance application process was flawed, none of the other surveillance conducted in the Russia investigation suffered from the same problems. The Page problems don't invalidate the rest of the Mueller work, Leahy argued. Other Democrats complained about the use of the time and energy of the Judiciary Committee to execute what Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, R-R.I., called a political errand for Trump. Graham defended what he called the need to excavate the decisions in the Russia investigation and, meanwhile, has sought to show the Judiciary Committee can keep many plates spinning at once. The committee heard from witnesses on Tuesday about the deadly effects of the coronavirus within the federal prison system and Graham also has planned a hearing later this month about race and policing following Floyd's death.

Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced the charges during a news conference. “I feel a little safer now that these monsters are off the street and no longer able to terrorize anyone else,” said Messiah Young, who was dragged from the vehicle along with his girlfriend, Taniyah Pilgrim, while they were caught in traffic. The Saturday night incident first gained attention from video online and on local news. Throughout, the couple can be heard screaming and asking officers what is happening. Two of the officers, Investigator Ivory Streeter and Investigator Mark Gardner, were fired Sunday. Streeter and Gardner are both charged with aggravated assault. Two others are also charged with aggravated assault, while one is charged with aggravated battery. Some of the officers are also charged with criminal damage to property as well as pointing or aiming a gun.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore) Taniyah Pilgrim speaks as Messiah Young’s looks on during a news conference on the campus of Morehouse College. (AP Photo/John Bazemore) Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Pilgrim was released without charges. She said Young, was released, too, and she’s ordering the charges against him dropped. She didn’t specify what charges he faced. A police report says Young was charged with attempting to elude police and driving with a suspended license. Dramatic body camera video that police released Sunday night shows police taking another young man into custody in a downtown street alongside a line of stopped cars. The man is pleading with police to let him go, saying he didn’t do anything. Young, sitting in the driver’s seat of a car stopped in the street holds up his phone, appearing to shoot video as an officer approaches and pulls the driver’s side door open. Young pulls the door shut and says repeatedly, “I’m not dying today.” He urges the officers to release the other man and let him get in the car as the dark sedan advances a bit. The car gets stuck in traffic and officers run up to both sides of the car shouting orders. An officer uses a stun gun on Pilgrim as she’s trying to get out of the car and then officers pull her from the vehicle. Another officer yells at Young to put the car in park and open the window. An officer repeatedly hits the driver’s side window with a baton, and another officer finally manages to break it. As the glass shatters, an officer uses a stun gun on Young and officers pull him from the car as officers shout, “Get your hand out of your pockets,” and, “He got a gun. He got a gun. He got a gun.” Once he’s out of the car and on the ground, officers zip tie Young’s hands behind his back and lead him away. Police reports do not list a gun as having been recovered. “I’m so happy that they’re being held accountable for their actions,” Pilgrim said at a news conference.

(WAVY/WFXR) — Hampton police say numerous people looted and vandalized some businesses at Peninsula Town Center on Tuesday night hours after a peaceful protest there. About 10 people were arrested and a woman was hurt after things escalated around midnight. Black Lives Matter 757 made it clear beforehand that they were not involved in organizing this event, and said “it could possibly be a setup.” When 10 On Your Side viewers reached out to the organizers “powertothepeople757,” the page for the protest was deleted shortly after.

People who spoke with 10 On Your Side on Wednesday morning said they came out with pure intentions to speak out against police brutality and the senseless death of George Floyd. Police say nearly 600 people started to march on Mercury Boulevard around 9 p.m. on Tuesday, marching up and down Mercury before splitting into two groups. One group returned to the Target parking lot, where they prayed, hugged, and took a knee with police. The other group went up on I-64 for about an hour and blocked traffic. VDOT Hampton Roads said all eastbound and westbound lanes were blocked on I-64, but didn’t specify whether they were closed due to any demonstrations. The lanes had all reopened by 11:30 p.m. on Tuesday. Both witnesses and police told 10 On Your Side things took a turn around midnight. Police say demonstrators surrounded the officers and someone from the crowd released a smoke bomb. People then started throwing glass bottles of urine and feces at officers before someone started firing shots. Police say that’s when they declared an unlawful assembly and deployed tear gas on the crowd. The group members ran into the Town Center complex, with the vandalism of businesses starting shortly afterward. “Once they fired off to the crowd, the crowd ran this way and scattered. Once they scattered, that’s when people started tearing up businesses … about four or five businesses they looted or destroyed,” said witness EJ Jones. “And the sad part about it is, about three or four of these businesses are Black businesses.” Police Chief Terry Sult said the force did the best they could with the resources they have.

Protesters gather at a memorial for George Floyd where he died outside Cup Foods on East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, Monday, June 1, 2020, in Minneapolis. Protests continued following the death of Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (Source: AP Photo/John Minchillo) The most serious charge was filed against Derek Chauvin, who was caught on video pressing his knee to Floyd's neck and now must defend himself against an accusation of second-degree murder. The three other officers at the scene were charged for the first time with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. All four were fired last week. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to four decades in prison. Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Those charges still stand. The new second-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd's death without intent while committing another felony, namely third-degree assault. It carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison, compared with a maximum of 25 years for third-degree murder. The other officers — Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao — face the same maximum penalties for aiding and abetting. All three men were in custody by Wednesday evening. Chauvin was arrested last week and is still being held. The multiple charges against each officer would offer a jury more options to find them guilty. The charges were sought by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who called the protests unleashed by the death ""dramatic and necessary"" and said Floyd ""should be here and he is not."" ""His life had value, and we will seek justice,"" said Ellison, who cautioned that winning convictions would be hard and said that public pressure had no bearing on his decisions. Hundreds of protesters were in New York City's Washington Square Park when the charges were announced. ""It's not enough,"" protester Jonathan Roldan said, insisting all four officers should have been charged from the start. ""Right now, we're still marching because it's not enough that they got arrested. There needs to be systematic change."" Ben Crump, an attorney for Floyd's family, called it ""a bittersweet moment"" and ""a significant step forward on the road to justice."" Crump said Elison had told the family he would continue his investigation into Floyd's death and upgrade the charge to first-degree murder if warranted. The move by prosecutors punctuated an unprecedented week in modern American history, in which largely peaceful protests took place in communities of all sizes but were rocked by bouts of violence, including deadly attacks on officers, rampant thefts and arson in some places. Nationwide, more than 9,000 have been arrested in connection with unrest. At least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, speaking after the new charges were announced, said the state and nation need to ""seize the moment"" and use the wrenching events of the past week to confront the effects of racism, including unequal educational and economic opportunities. ""I think this is probably our last shot, as a state and as a nation, to fix this systemic issue,"" he said at a news conference. Also Wednesday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office released the full autopsy report on Floyd, which noted he had previously tested positive for COVID-19, but was apparently asymptomatic. The report was released with the family's permission after summary findings Monday that said he had a heart attack while being restrained by officers. President Donald Trump has pushed the nation's governors to take a hard line against the violence. He again tweeted Wednesday: ""LAW & ORDER!"" An overpowering security force — including officers from the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, the Secret Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Prisons and, according to a senior defense official, at least 2,200 National Guard soldiers — was out in force Wednesday as thousands of peaceful protesters demonstrated in the nation's capital. Some remained near the White House while others marched toward the Capitol building. Military vehicles were parked on streets near the White House, and an array of agencies kept watch from the air. An FBI plane, an Army surveillance plane and a Park Police helicopter circled overhead. At one point near the White House, protesters began singing ""Amazing Grace"" as they knelt in view of law enforcement officers in riot gear. ""We are not going anywhere!"" they chanted. There were no signs of confrontations. Protester Jade Jones, 30, said the demonstrations would continue despite the new charges. ""That's the least they could do,"" said Jones, who had been attending Washington protests for days. ""It's not going to wipe away 400 years of pain."" ""We are glad there are additional charges, but that doesn't mean justice has been served,"" she said. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. In New York City, where high-end stores were looted in earlier days, some retailers fortified their property. At the luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue, windows were boarded up, then covered in chain-link fencing and razor wire. The front of the store was guarded by a line of tattooed men with dogs. There was scuffling in some parts of the city Wednesday night, but no signs of major clashes between protesters and police. The protests have also taken root overseas. In Greece, police fired tear gas after young people attacked them Wednesday outside the U.S. Embassy in Athens. Some 4,000 protesters had been peaceful until near the end of the demonstration, when some threw gasoline bombs and stones at police. No injuries or arrests were reported. Other protests were held Wednesday in London, Helsinki, Rotterdam and Bogota, among other cities. The anger over Floyd's death has spilled into an array of racial issues across the U.S. In Philadelphia, for example, a statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo was removed by the city Wednesday after repeatedly being targeted by vandals. Rizzo presided over a police force widely accused of racism and brutality in the 1970s. In Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam was expected to announce plans Thursday for the removal of an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Richmond's prominent Monument Avenue, a senior administration official told The Associated Press. The statue in the former Confederate capital has been the target of vandalism during the protests. ___ Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.

WASHINGTON — As protestors continue marching through the streets of D.C. demanding justice for George Floyd and other victims of police brutality, many of the events happening echo what the city went through after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The images of buildings burning, storefronts with broken glass and police rushing the streets mirror the fires, damage, and civil unrest D.C. saw 52 years ago. “I think the obvious connection is to what happened in 1968 in the wake of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr,” said Jane Levey, who is the house historian with the Historical Society of Washington, D.C. Levey explained people were hurt after King’s death, and the District suffered a major blow. “We had rioting that lasted from Thursday to Saturday of that week,” she recalled. “Three of our neighborhoods were just devastated by the rioting, and they were majority African-American neighborhoods.” The communities that were most affected included U Street, 14th Street, and the H Street Corridor. “It was anger, it was hurt, and it was the moment of rebellion. As anarchy began to settle in, we didn’t have enough police to protect businesses. People began to roam the streets and take what they wanted,” Levey told WUSA9. Things became violent during the unrest with 13 people killed and thousands arrested in the span of four nights. President Lyndon B. Johnson used thousands of military troops to regain order which was the same force President Donald Trump threatened to use during protests in the present day. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” President Trump said during a press conference on Monday. “The attitude on the Hill and the attitude in the White House was we can’t have the symbol of the United States be attacked by its own citizens,” Levey described President Johnson’s reason to use military force in the District in 1968. Like present today, the citizens’ unrest was more than just the death they were mourning. Conditions for black Americans were not favorable with unfair housing policies, underemployment and income gaps. Levey told WUSA9 there were unfair, and what some called, racist police practices that people were fighting against. WATCH: Protests have influenced political change throughout American history #GeorgeFloyd Posted by Michael Quander on Tuesday, June 2, 2020 Levey described recovery from the fallout and destruction of the riots was slow. “The federal government was not at the table during recovery,” she said. Recovery did not begin happening until the late ’90s and early 2000’s when the city saw a building boom. One of the last neighborhoods to bounce back was the H Street Corridor. “I think that at a moment like this it is especially important to understand the rook causes historically of systemic racism and to understand how you work with the system to change those problems,” Levey said.",0.0

Beaty was one of two people fatally shot in Indianapolis during protests over the death of George Floyd.(AP Photo/Michael Conroy) INDIANAPOLIS – To those who knew former Indiana University football player Chris Beaty, it was no surprise that he would participate in a protest over the death of George Floyd. That a man they saw as a “gentle giant” who brought positivity everywhere he went would turn up dead in an alley after a peaceful demonstration turned violent was unfathomable. “He promoted peace and understanding and love every way that he could,” said Michael Cranfill, a restaurant and craft beer taproom owner. “He is someone, I think, who would take every opportunity he could to bring people together.” Beaty's body was found Saturday night not far from his apartment, one of two people fatally shot after violence erupted during an Indianapolis protest. The death of the man who was known as Mr. Indianapolis because of his unwavering support and enthusiasm for the city was just one of several in the U.S. during a week of protest and unrest since Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleading for air. Others slain include a Louisville, Kentucky, restaurant owner who was shot by authorities trying to disperse a crowd; a federal officer in Oakland, California, who was shot at a courthouse by someone in a passing vehicle; and a man shot outside a pawn shop in Minneapolis. Police in Indianapolis did not release details Tuesday of Beaty's slaying. Arely Elrod said she met Beaty about a decade ago through mutual friends who would attend local events together. “He was so selfless and always so positive,” said Elrod, who owns a cleaning service. “He felt like there was always a need in a time of hatred. He was always the one to make sure he made a difference.” Beaty, 38, graduated from Indianapolis Cathedral High School and played defensive lineman at Indiana University from 2000 to 2004. Since then, he had become a business owner in Indianapolis. “The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” Indiana head football coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.” The school said Beaty had been president of Fresh Marketing LLC. A May 4 post on Beaty’s Facebook page said that he and his team had created a reusable and washable cloth facemask with a filter for people to use during the coronavirus pandemic. “As the realization that life is changing set in from sitting on the couch during quarantine, I figured out a way to be proactive and help people during these COVID-19 times,” the post read. “If you’re going back to work and looking for a solution to your ‘new normal’ please keep us in mind.” Beaty also owned and operated nightclubs and recently sold some of his businesses, said Cranfill, who added that when he opened his own restaurant in downtown Indianapolis Beaty asked how they could work together to grow the community. “He was a gentle giant, the kind of guy that would just draw you in with his energy,” said Cranfill, 37. “He had the most amazing smile, would give you a big hug. He exuded care for his community — someone who brought everyone together.” Cranfill called Beaty a leader, not just for African Americans in the community, but for all of Indianapolis. “I prayed and said, ‘Let his memory be the unifying moment to stop this violence, for us to come together, lay down our differences and for people to begin to heal and hear each other,’” Cranfill said. ___ Williams reported from West Bloomfield, Michigan.",0.0

(WAVY) — There will be a protest taking place every day this month in Virginia Beach in the name of racial justice. However, organizers with the Virginia Beach Interdenominational Ministers Conference say these protests won’t be distinguished by large attendance numbers. Rather, fittingly during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, these demonstrations will be measured by the number of protesters that are not going to two particular locations. “We will not be spending money at the Virginia Beach Oceanfront. We will not be shopping at Virginia Beach Town Center,” said Dr. Luther S Allen III, who is Senior Pastor at First Lynnhaven Baptist Church. “We’re going to make our voices heard through the withholding of our dollars.” Allen made the announcement at a prayer vigil held Tuesday evening at Mt. Trashmore. The vigil was held in response to the homicide of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis Police, the latest high profile African American death involving law enforcement. Joined by elected leaders and hundreds of community members of all ages and races, ministers said they would be “silent no longer.” Ministers want the expedited creation of a citizens review board to oversee complaints with police officers. They also want to see plans that would bring about a more diverse police force as well as reforms to school discipline. “We want to make sure that people understand the seriousness of where our community is in response to George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. We want to make it known that we are willing to make those initial commitments to say ‘hey we’re not going to spend in places that are not overtly connected with what the message we are trying to put out.” Oceanfront and Town Center businesses were singled out because of their importance to the local economy, Allen said. Several speakers say “peaceful protests” alone don’t always spur substantive change. “One thing shown to be taken seriously is the economics,” Allen said. This isn’t the first time the ministers have pointed to what they see as issues with the Oceanfront business climate. The hope is the boycott, being dubbed VB Black Out 2020, brings forward businesses to put pressure on city leaders. Virginia Beach business owners who stand in solidarity with the VBIMC and want to make their support known are asked to contact Rev. Dr. James Allen at james@thejamesallengroup.com “We’ll see come July 1 who is with us,” Allen said. Latest posts:",0.0

For many Americans, it goes without saying that the police are critical in maintaining public safety. Have an emergency? Call the police. But many others — especially black people and poor people — have long countered that the police pose more of a threat to their safety than a boon. See a police officer? Walk the other direction. So it seems like a good moment to talk to Alex S. Vitale. He's the author of the 2017 book The End of Policing. In it, he argues that rather than focus on police reform or officer retraining, the country needs to fundamentally reconsider what it is the police should be doing at all. I spoke with Vitale about what roles police should and shouldn't play, what he makes of the current protests and what actual change in the way police in this country do their jobs might look like. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. One of the arguments you make in The End of Policing is that police are being asked to do too much. They're basically being tasked with addressing every social problem that we have. So what are police asked to do? And what should they be asked to do? One of the problems that we're encountering here is this massive expansion in the scope of policing over the last 40 years or so. Policing is now happening in our schools. It's happening in relation to the problems of homelessness, untreated mental illness, youth violence and some things that we historically associate police with. But the policing has become more intensive, more invasive, more aggressive. So what I'm calling for is a rethink on why we've turned all of these social problems over to the police to manage. And as we dial those things back, then we can think more concretely about what the rest of policing should look like and how that could be reformed. You brought up homelessness. In many cities police are tasked with dealing with people experiencing homelessness — but they don't have many options besides basically moving people or arresting them. Well, we've created this situation where our political leaders have basically abandoned the possibility of actually housing people. Which, of course, is the real solution, supportive housing for those who need extra support. But basically, we have a massive failure in housing markets that is unable to provide basic shelter for millions of Americans. So instead of actually addressing that fundamental problem, we have relabeled it as a problem that is the fault of the disorderly people who we label as morally deficient. And then we use police to criminalize them, to control their behavior and to reduce their disorderly impact on the rest of us. And this is perverse and unjust. So then it places police in this completely untenable situation, because they completely lack the tools to make this problem any better. And yet we've told them it's their problem to manage. ... Part of our misunderstanding about the nature of policing is we keep imagining that we can turn police into social workers. That we can make them nice, friendly community outreach workers. But police are violence workers. That's what distinguishes them from all other government functions, is that they have the legal capacity to use violence in situations where the average citizen would be arrested. So when we turn a problem over to the police to manage, there will be violence, because those are ultimately the tools that they are most equipped to utilize: handcuffs, threats, guns, arrests. That's what really is at the root of policing. So if we don't want violence, we should try to figure out how to not get the police involved. There are obviously a lot of people who agree broadly with the notion that the way that policing happens in this country is a problem and that there needs to be some sort of change. But they're pretty invested in the idea that police are needed to maintain public safety. People ask the question, without police, what do you do when someone gets murdered? What do you do when someone's house gets robbed? What do you say to those people who have those concerns? Well, I'm certainly not talking about any kind of scenario where tomorrow someone just flips a switch and there are no police. What I'm talking about is the systematic questioning of the specific roles that police currently undertake, and attempting to develop evidence-based alternatives so that we can dial back our reliance on them. And my feeling is that this encompasses actually the vast majority of what police do. We have better alternatives for them. Even if you take something like burglary — a huge amount of burglary activity is driven by drug use. And we need to completely rethink our approach to drugs so that property crime isn't the primary way that people access drugs. We don't have any part of this country that has high quality medical drug treatment on demand. But we have policing on demand everywhere. And it's not working. Obviously, a big part of what is on people's minds right now is the role that police have in dealing with protesters, dealing with different types of political unrest. In your book, you talk a lot about the history of how police have been used to quell social unrest. Can you talk about that history a little bit? Well, I think that one of the myths we have about policing is that it is politically neutral, and that it is always here to sort of create order in a way that benefits everyone. But the reality is that America's social order has never been entirely equitable. We have a long history of exploitation of the indigenous population, of African Americans through slavery, Jim Crow and today. And while we're not using police to manage slavery or colonialism today, we are using police to manage the problems that our very unequal system has produced. We're invested in this kind of austerity politics that says the government can't afford to really do anything to lift people up. We have to put all our resources into subsidizing the already most successful parts of the economy. But those parts of the economy are producing this huge group of people who are homeless, unemployed, have untreated mental health and substance abuse problems. And then we ask the police to put a lid on those problems — to manage them so they don't interfere with the ""order"" that we're supposedly all benefiting from. But if you're one of those poor people, one of those folks with a mental health problem, someone who's involved in black market activities to survive, then you experience this as constant criminalization. And would you say the same goes for people who are political protesters? Political protest has always been a part of this dynamic, right? Political protests are a threat to the order of this system. And so policing has always been the primary tool for managing those threats to the public order. Just as we understand the use of police to deal with homelessness as a political failure, every time we turn a political order problem over to the police to manage, that's also a political failure. I think the mayor of Minneapolis, for instance: Jacob Frey. He has consistently tried to frame this as a problem of a few bad apples. And he says, ""Why are you protesting? We fired them."" But this completely misunderstands the nature of the grievances. And instead of actually addressing those grievances, he's throwing police at the problem. Are the interactions that are happening right now between police and protesters something that you think is predictable? Or is this something new that we haven't seen before? It's not completely new, it's just the intensity of it compared to, let's say, five years ago during the Eric Garner and the Mike Brown protests. What we're seeing is really an immediate escalation to very high levels of force, a high degree of confrontation. And I think part of it is driven by deep frustration within policing, which is that police feel under assault, and they have no answer. They trotted out all the possible solutions: police-community dialogue sessions, implicit bias training, community policing, body cameras. And it just didn't work. It didn't make any difference. And so they ran out of excuses. So the protests today are a much more kind of existential threat to the police. And the police are overreacting as a result. If we were to take serious steps toward moving in the direction of having police address fewer of our social problems and putting those problems in the hands of people who are actually more equipped to deal with them, what would be the next step? What is the next thing that we as a country have to push for? I think this will look like a series of local budget battles. And that's really what's going on across the country, is when we have these divest campaigns in places like Los Angeles and Minneapolis and New York and Durham, North Carolina and Nashville, Tennessee and Dallas, Texas. These are folks who are saying concretely: ""We don't want police in our schools. We want that money spent in ways that help our children, not criminalize them. We don't want more money for overtime for narcotics officers. We want actual drug treatment programs, safe injection facilities, things that will help people."" So that's what this looks like. It's about rallying city council members and mayors around a new vision of creating healthier communities. When you're looking around at what's happening right now, what are the things that you think people need to understand to really process what is going on around the country? Well, I think the police are making the argument for us, right? People started this conversation by saying policing is out of control; they're not making the situation better. They have not been reformed. Well, now all you have to do is turn on the nightly news and see how true that is. The level of aggression and unnecessary escalation is stark evidence of how unreformed policing is, and I argue how unreformable it is. The question is whether or not people will take it to the next step and ask the tough political questions. Why are our mayors turning this over to the police to manage? Why are we using curfews instead of having conversations? Why are we throwing protesters in prison instead of trying to figure out what's driving all of this anger? ",0.0

The crosstown trip was excoriated by several Catholic leaders, including Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory, who said he found it ""baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles"" by allowing the visit. The Trumps' visit to the shrine in Northeast Washington came on the 41st anniversary of the start of St. John Paul II's pilgrimage to his native Poland, the first trip by the pope during which he repeatedly addressed religious and political freedom. The White House said the president offered no remarks during the visit. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accompanied the Trumps during the brief stay at the shrine. About 100 people, including children and their parents, had gathered near the shrine and began chanting slogans calling for justice for George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis May 25. Archbishop Gregory said Catholic teaching calls the faithful to ""defend the rights of all people, even those with whom we might disagree."" The evening before the shrine visit, Trump walked from the White House to St. John Episcopal Church, which was set afire during protests May 31 that called for the nation to address racism and police violence. Authorities fired flash-bang shells, gas and rubber bullets to disperse a crowd that had gathered in Lafayette Square across from the White House so Trump could walk to the church, where he held up a Bible as photographers captured the scene. The crowd was present in the park to protest the death of Floyd and other African American people at the hands of police. Archbishop Gregory questioned the decision to disperse the protesters in such a manner. ""St. John Paul II was an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings. His legacy bears vivid witness to that truth. He certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.""",0.0

Protests have taken place across America and internationally, after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd's neck while the handcuffed black man called out that he couldn't breathe. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with murder. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) LONDON – Thousands of people demonstrated in London on Wednesday against police violence and racial injustice following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which has set off days of unrest in the United States. In Athens, police fired tear gas to disperse youths who threw firebombs and stones at them outside the U.S. Embassy toward the end of an otherwise peaceful protest by about 4,000 people. No injuries or arrests were reported. The London demonstration began in Hyde Park, with protesters chanting “Black lives matter,” before many of them later marched through the streets, blocking traffic. Some of them converged on Parliament and the nearby Downing Street office of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A few scuffles erupted between protesters and police outside the street's heavy metal gates. Inside, Johnson told a news conference that he was “appalled and sickened” by Floyd's death on May 25 when a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Earlier, “Star Wars” actor John Boyega, who was born in Britain to Nigerian parents and grew up in south London's Peckham neighborhood, pleaded tearfully for demonstrators to stay peaceful. “Because they want us to mess up, they want us to be disorganized, but not today,” he said. Boyega recalled the case of Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old black man from southeast London who was stabbed to death in 1993 as he waited for a bus. The case against his attackers collapsed in 1996, and a government report cited institutional racism by the London police force as a key factor in its failure to thoroughly investigate the killing. “Black lives have always mattered,"" Boyega said. “We have always been important. We have always meant something. We have always succeeded regardless and now is the time. I ain’t waiting.” Police appeared to keep a low profile during the demonstration and the ensuing marches. Earlier, the U.K.'s most senior police officer said she was “appalled” by Floyd's death and “horrified” by the subsequent violence in U.S. cities. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said the London force would “continue with our tradition of policing using minimum force necessary.” While the London protesters expressed solidarity with Americans protesting Floyd’s death, many also pointed to issues closer to home. “Racism is a pandemic,” said one placard at the London demonstration. Some of them carried placards saying “Justice for Belly Mujinga,” a 47-year-old railway station worker who died of coronavirus in April, weeks after an incident in which she said she was coughed and spat upon by a customer who claimed to be infected. Her death has come to symbolize the high toll the virus has taken on ethnic minority Britons and front-line workers -- and, for some, social injustice. Police did not bring charges against the man accused of confronting Mujinga, saying an investigation showed he did not infect her and there was no evidence to substantiate a criminal offense. Johnson, who has sought to cultivate close ties with U.S. President Donald Trump, was asked what he would say to him. He replied: “My message to President Trump, to everybody in the United States from the U.K., is that ... racism, racist violence has no place in our society.” Johnson said people had the right to protest but “I would urge people to protest peacefully, and in accordance with the rules on social distancing.” “Everybody’s lives matter, black lives matter, but we must fight this virus, as well,” he said. In other rallies around the world: — More than 1,000 people protested in Stockholm despite a ban on gatherings of over 50 people due to the coronavirus, and while they expressed solidarity with U.S. demonstrators, participants were keen to emphasize that racial injustice was a problem in Sweden, too. One sign read “Make racism bad again.. Police said they had to use pepper spray and make one arrest. — About 3,000 people rallied in Finland’s capital of Helsinki, although they dispersed an hour later when the number of participants exceeded the 500 maximum allowed under virus restrictions. — In Cape Town, South Africa, about 20 people gathered at the gates of parliament and held up signs reading “Justice 4 George Floyd and Collins Khosa.” Khosa died a month ago after being confronted by soldiers and police in Johannesburg’s Alexandra township. Family members say he died after being choked and beaten, but a South African army investigation cleared the soldiers — a finding the relatives' lawyers say they will challenge. — Police cut short a demonstration in the Dutch port of Rotterdam by thousands of protesters when the crowd got too big for coronavirus social distancing measures. Many of the London demonstrators appeared to ignore social distancing guidelines in the U.K., where people have been told to stay 2 meters (6 feet) apart. The coronavirus outbreak has exposed divisions and inequalities within the U.K. A government-commissioned report Tuesday confirmed that ethnic minorities in Britain experienced a higher death rate from the coronavirus than whites, but did not provide any recommendations on how to alleviate the risks. Figures from London’s Metropolitan Police also showed that black and ethnic minority Londoners were more likely than their white counterparts to be fined or arrested for breaking lockdown rules barring gatherings or nonessential travel. —- Associated Press writer Gerald Imray in Cape Town, South Africa, and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed.",0.0

Mostly peaceful throughout the day, the demonstrators faced police officers, National Guard troops and other forces. President Trump called New York protesters ""lowlifes and losers,"" in a tweet posted Tuesday. Demonstrators throughout the country showed up, even in smaller towns such as Brattleboro, Vt., and Kingman, Ariz. Here are our updates on what is happening around the country: New York City Protesters gathered at places including the Barclays Center, Times Square and at the NYPD headquarters Tuesday, and daytime demonstrations were relatively peaceful. Tuesday was the first day for the citywide 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, which will stay in effect until at least Sunday, the mayor announced. Trump called on the city to bring in the National Guard in a tweet. New York City put on an 11:00 P.M. CURFEW last night. No wonder they ripped the place apart. Should be 7:00 P.M. CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. #SAVENYC — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2020 Mayor Bill de Blasio responded, ""Thank God we have not had a loss of life in these last 5 days, but you bring outside armed forces into an equation they are not trained for...that is a dangerous scenario."" Police cars and a helicopter converged on one group of marchers blocking an intersection on the Upper East Side around 9 p.m. Protesters chanted ""peaceful protest"" and held their arms up as officers dispersed the crowd. Marchers told NPR they joined the rally in part because of Floyd's death, but also because they're convinced officers around the country are targeting black men. Many businesses were boarded up to prevent a repeat of Monday night's looting. One business owner who stood outside his shop told NPR he was grateful for the heavy police presence. In Times Square, medical workers, who New York residents have cheered on throughout the coronavirus pandemic, came out to support demonstrations.

Sea of protestors demanding cops take a knee, someone bangs on the police van and everyone jumps.

Crowd chanting”let us through” on Manhattan side of bridge pic.twitter.com/R0ieAttU74 — Amy Julia Harris (@amyjharris) June 3, 2020 Once those demonstrators who crossed the bridge attempted to exit and enter Manhattan, a standoff between hundreds of protesters and throngs of police officers took place. Officers blocked demonstrators from leaving, and protesters chanted ""Let us through!"" Los Angeles Angry residents called for Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore to resign following days of unrest over Floyd's death and multiple complaints of brutality by law enforcement. About 500 participants called to join a police commission meeting, causing connection delays. But after nearly an hour, with technical issues resolved, hundreds more residents were added. Many expressed outrage with Moore and said the department has met demonstrations with an excessive use of force with rubber bullets, tear gas, flash bangs and batons against peaceful and rioting demonstrators alike. Since Monday, Moore has drawn ire following remarks that protesters are ""capitalizing"" on the latest bouts of chaos, although he apologized on the Tuesday morning call, saying he ""misspoke."" ""We will investigate each complaint, and I promise to hold accountable anyone who violates our policy or commits other misconduct,"" Moore said, according to the LA Times. Moore noted there have been 13 officer-involved shootings since the start of the year. He added that more than 2,700 people have been arrested amid the protests — most for ""failure to disperse"" for curfew. Additionally, he said 27 LAPD personnel have been injured, including one hospitalized for a fractured skull and another for a broken knee. It is unclear how many protesters have been injured. Later in the day, more protesters gathered across the sprawling city, including in Hollywood, where armed National Guard members were stationed. About an hour before the countywide curfew went into effect, a massive column of demonstrators marched to Mayor Eric Garcetti's home in Hancock Park, a wealthy neighborhood lined with palm trees and mansions. ""I hear you that this isn't just about the criminal justice system. This is also about society and where we put our resources,"" Garcetti said in a news conference. ""I choose to listen and move forward, and bring this city together to build peace on our streets and in our neighborhoods,"" Garcetti said. ""George Floyd died in our America so that we may make sense of our future to make sure that we never see that again."" Hours past the curfew, demonstrators continued to flout orders to evacuate the streets. Washington, D.C. Large crowds showed up again a day after federal forces used tear gas and rubber bullets on peaceful demonstrators at Lafayette Square, across from the White House. Protesters on Tuesday in Washington, where there was also a primary election, were peaceful. The Washington Post and DCist reported that thousands demonstrated, surpassing Monday's crowd size. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also joined demonstrators on Tuesday. National Guard troops, the U.S. Park Police and Department of Homeland Security officers stood inside a 7-foot metal fence that was put up overnight and surrounded the perimeter of Lafayette Square, as protesters clung to the outside. At sunset, hundreds lay on the ground face-down at the Capitol, emulating the position in which Minneapolis police held George Floyd before his death. As midnight neared, reporters said large crowds were still protesting peacefully, hours past the city's 7 p.m. curfew. This is a developing story. Some things reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops. ",0.0
