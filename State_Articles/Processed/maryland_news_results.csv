HAGERSTOWN, Md. (WDVM) — The military’s two top aerial demonstration teams, the Navy Blue Angels and the Air Force Thunderbirds, have been staging flyovers in major cities, including Washington, D.C. as part of a national salute to first responders, medical personnel and major hospitals who are waging war against COVID-19 that continues to kill thousands of Americans. During my career in broadcast news, I have been one of the few journalists in the country to have flown with both the “Blues and the Birds.” Ross Simpson with Ross with Lt. Dave Rottering The first flight occurred on October 27, 1987 with Lt. Dave Roettering, the public affairs officer for the Blue Angels. I was one of two members of the media in the Nation’s Capital that year to become an Honorary Blue Angel. I remember climbing into the rear cockpit of a Korean War era fighter plane and taxiing out for takeoff at Andrews Air Force Base. Blue Angels The pilot and I weren’t wearing G-suits to keep blood from being forced from our heads into our lower extremities by the force of gravity and blacking out. But we did a lot of “grunting” to prevent that from happening. The flight lasted almost an hour. While flying over the Chesapeake Bay, we came screaming out of the sun and buzzed some duck hunters in a blind along the bay. I can still see the started looks on their faces as we zoomed by, but the ride of a lifetime occurred almost years later at Warner-Robbins Air Force Base in Georgia when I flew with the Air Force Thunderbirds. This time, the aircraft was an F-16D model Flying Falcon, a sleek needle-nosed aircraft. The pilot of Thunderbird-8 was Major Jim Hardin, who later flew combat missions in the Gulf War. Ross Simpson and Major Jim Hardin. The flight was part of my opening coverage on the NBC Radio Network for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. After striking the signature “Thunderbird Pose” with the pilot, I climbed the ladder on the left side of the aircraft and posed for a “Hero” shot. The ground crew had stenciled my name on the lid of the canopy. Ross Simpson The F-16D was equipped with a dash cam, so every moment of the hour-long flight in a MOA, a military operating area, was captured on video tape. I could also hear communications between the control tower at Warner-Robbins and Major Hardin who was sitting just in front of me as we turned onto the runway. I remember telling Hardin to “light the fuse” as he shoved the throttle forward and Thunderbird-8 lunged forward. We stayed only four feet off the runway as we picked up speed, and then went ballistic. Ross Simpson flying “We’re going straight up,” said Hardin as he told to look over my right shoulder and watch the runway get “smaller and smaller” below us. In the F-16 Fighting Falcon, pilots and their passenger in the D-Model recline slightly in their ejection seats so that their helmets don’t hit the top of the glass cockpit canopy and allow for a sleeker shape to the aircraft and better airflow, unlike Blue Angels pilots who sit upright in F/A 18 Hornets. After climbing to 37,000 feet and rolling inverted so I could look down and see the countryside around Warner-Robbins, Hardin leveled off the aircraft, lifted his hand off the stick and said, “Take it, show me what you can do.” I started easy with a four-point roll. “Nice,” said Hardin, “Do you have any other maneuvers you can do.” “Yeah,” I replied as I pulled back on the stick, turned on the smoke, and performed an over-the-top roll; coming down the backside and cutting the smoke ring with the nose of the aircraft.” Ross Simpson in rear cockpit That really impressed Hardin who asked where I learned to fly like that. “I read a book on aerobatics before coming down here,” I replied. “No way,” snapped Hardin who reminded me that it takes years to teach fighter pilots these maneuvers. I laughed and said, “I must be a fast-learner.” The rest of the time was spent punching holes in clouds. One in particular was a giant thunderhead that came boiling up to our altitude. Checking to make sure the other side was clear of any aircraft that might have strayed into the military operation area, I added a few degrees of climb on the aircraft and gave Thunderbird-8 a bath. Shortly after getting my flight certificate as an Honorary Thunderbird, the Air Force banned civilians like me from actually flying any of their aircraft, including one of its Thunderbirds.

Ah, and asked them to come in and conduct a federal investigation, which they have been on the ground there doing that. And so they will be taking, ah, uh, lead in this investigation. Advertisement President Trump says he asked FBI, Justice Dept. to expedite investigation after man died in police custody Mayor: Officer who put knee on man's neck should be charged Share Shares Copy Link Copy President Donald Trump called for justice Wednesday for the death of George Floyd after a police officer put his knee on the man's neck.It happened after a white police officer was seen on video kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed black man during an arrest, even after the man said he couldn't breathe and stopped moving.""At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd,"" Trump said on Twitter.""I have asked for this investigation to be expedited and greatly appreciate all of the work done by local law enforcement. My heart goes out to George’s family and friends. Justice will be served!""Meanwhile, the mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges to be filed.Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said he believes officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in Monday's death of Floyd. Chauvin and three other officers were fired Tuesday. The video recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes as Floyd is on the ground with his face against the pavement.“I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white.He later added: ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.”But despite the officers' swift dismissals, whether the death will be considered a criminal act or something less, like excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate.Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. The Star Tribune reported more conflict Wednesday night at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The newspaper also reported looting at a Target store across the street from the station.Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door.Video: Aerials show protests in Los AngelesMany activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete.Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests.“We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.”Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department's culture.“One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said.The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Video: Protester falls off police vehicle (warning: graphic)Bridgett Floyd told NBC's “Today” show that the officers involved in her brother's death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she had not watched the video, but she told ABC's “Good Morning America” that she does not understand ""how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that.""The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd's death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe.In the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed.The officers in the Minneapolis case have not been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Chauvin. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further.The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned.During Tuesday's protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” Some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station.News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record.In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook.Two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long, noting that the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.”“He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.”Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest.The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement.Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.”The man slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics.Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said.At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?”Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant's owner, Jovanni Thunstrom.He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.”___Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, and Hearst TV contributed to this report.",0.0
1617169033,2020-05-26 10:21:04,Man dies after video shows officer kneeling on his neck,https://www.localdvm.com/news/national/man-dies-after-video-shows-officer-kneeling-on-his-neck/,en,True,,433540,localdvm.com,http://localdvm.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A black man has died in Minneapolis police custody after video shared online from a bystander showed a white officer kneeling on his neck during his arrest as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. His death, which occurred Monday night after a struggle with police officers, was under investigation by the FBI and state agents. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, speaking to reporters Tuesday morning, was asked about the use of the knee on the man’s neck during the arrest. “We clearly have policies in place regarding placing someone under control,” Arradondo said, stating that taking a look at what happened and how those policies apply “will be part of the full investigation we’ll do internally.” Officers were called about 8 p.m. Monday to investigate a report of a forgery at a business, according to police spokesman John Elder. Police found the man, believed to be in his 40s, matching the suspect’s description in his car. “He was ordered to step from his car. After he got out, he physically resisted officers,” Elder said in a statement. “Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.” The man, who was not identified, was taken by ambulance to Hennepin County Medical Center where he died a short time later, police said. The name of the officer seen kneeling on his neck wasn’t immediately released. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has joined the FBI in its investigation. All body camera footage has been turned over to the BCA, which investigates most police shootings and in-custody deaths. The officers involved have been put on paid administrative leave, per department protocol. Nekima Levy-Armstrong, a prominent local activist, said watching the footage that was shared on social media made her “sick to her stomach” and she said it’s another example of police brutality toward African American men, the Star Tribune reported. “Whatever the man may have done should not have ended in a death sentence,” she said. “What started as an alleged economic incident once again turned deadly for a black man.” Levy-Armstrong said it reminded her of the Eric Garner case. He was an unarmed New York man who died in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life saying he couldn’t breathe. A grand jury later decided against indicting the officers involved, sparking protests around the country. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Tuesday morning urged those who might protest to take precautions amid the coronavirus outbreak. He said there is a “need to make sure everyone voicing their opinion is staying safe,” and he asked potential protesters to practice social distancing. “If you’re sad, I get it, if you’re angry, that makes complete sense, if you feel the need to protest, of course, we want to make sure people are able to express themselves,” Frey said. “There is another danger out there right now, which is COVID-19.” Police in Minneapolis have come under scrutiny in recent years for deadly run-ins with citizens. A 24-year-old black man, Jamar Clark, was shot in the head and died in 2015 after a confrontation with two white officers responding to a reported assault. A county prosecutor declined to prosecute the officers, saying Clark was struggling for one of the officers’ gun when he was shot. A white woman, Justine Rusczcyk Damond, died in 2017 when she was shot in the stomach by a Minneapolis officer responding to her 911 call. That officer, who is black, was convicted of manslaughter and murder and is serving a 12-year prison sentence.",0.0
1617943109,2020-05-27 08:31:15,Four Minneapolis Officers Fired After Death Of Black Man,https://www.afro.com/four-minneapolis-officers-fired-after-death-of-black-man/,en,True,,102973,The Afro-American Newspapers | Your Community. Your History. Your News.,http://www.afro.com,"By Sean Yoes AFRO Baltimore Editor [email protected] The plight of Black Americans has been fraught with peril since the arrival of the first Africans 400 years ago to the Jamestown colony in 1619. But, few times since uprisings swept across the urban centers of the nation in April 1968, in the aftermath of the murder of Dr. King, has a feeling of Black American rage seemed more palpable than this past terrible week. In the midst of a pandemic that has killed more than 100,000 Americans –the disproportionate number of the dead being people of color, poor people and the elderly — Black Americans endured the reliving of a nightmare, the execution of another unarmed Black man at the hands of law enforcement as he uttered the phrase, “I can’t breathe.” Pastor Seth Martin, a resident of Minneapolis spoke to the AFRO about the May 25 death of George Floyd, the calls for the prosecution of the officers and the tension mounting in the Black community. “This isn’t the first time something like this has happened here,” said Martin. “In fact, Philando Castile is one thing that motivated me to move here. So, I’m heartbroken, but I’m also determined to shine the light on this darkness.” Martin refers to 32-year old Philando Castile, who was killed by a St. Anthony, Minnesota police officer during a traffic stop July 6, 2016. Four White officers from the Minneapolis Police Department have been fired after a video surfaced of one of them with his knee and essentially his full body weight on Floyd’s neck, as the other officers stood by and watched. Floyd was lying on his stomach with his head turned to the side as the unnamed White officer kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for up to eight minutes according to local reports. Floyd, who was being detained for an alleged fraudulent transaction was heard on the phone camera video captured by a bystander repeatedly saying, “I can’t breathe.” He was motionless on the ground for several minutes as the officer kept his knee on his neck. He was officially pronounced dead at a local hospital moments after his body was transported by emergency medical personnel. Floyd pleaded for his life using the same words Eric Garner said at least 11 times prior to taking his last breaths in Staten Island, New York in July 2014; when he was killed by Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is still employed by the New York City Police Department. On May 26, dozens protesting Floyd’s arrest and death confronted members of law enforcement, which sparked arrests and tear gas being hurled at protesters. Recently, a third White man was charged in the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, who was gunned down in February about two miles from his home in a neighborhood outside of Brunswick, Georgia. William “Roddie” Bryan Jr., 50, was arrested on felony murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment charges in Arbery’s death, which has sparked national protests. Yet, some believe the killing of unarmed Black men, whether by the hands of law enforcement or White vigilantes, is related to a recent rise in gun purchases by Black Americans and has compelled some to question the effectiveness of nonviolent protests. Judi Reynolds, a disease intervention specialist and an assistant minister in Baltimore posted about the killing of unarmed Black men via Facebook, following what she describes as a disturbing conversation with her daughter, after she witnessed the video of Floyd’s arrest and death. “I explained to her that some police officers are intentionally killing Black men for sport,” wrote Reynolds. “After we ended our conversation, I looked at my grandson and thought about some vicious White police officer putting his knee on his neck. In 2020, I just don’t understand why there is still so much hate for Black men. My flesh wants me to start packing a pistol, and have a loaded rifle in my home,” she added. “In plain English, God’s Spirit is more powerful than anything we can do. So yes, protect your homes, guard your loved ones, make noise about racial injustice but most of all we need to ask God to intervene without ceasing.”",0.0

The 25-year-old black man was shot and killed by two white men while he was out for a jog in February in Glynn County, Ga. When video of the incident was released, it was met with public outcry and protest. In the weeks since, we've seen more outrage accompany new headlines about African Americans killed by police. Dreasjon ""Sean"" Reed was shot and killed in Indianapolis. Breonna Taylor, an emergency medical technician in Louisville, Ky., was shot eight times in her bed. And Monday night Minneapolis, another black man died in police custody; a video shows George Floyd pleading with an officer whose shoe is on his neck.

While we await such a day, Let us say your name: Ahmaud Arbery, Ahmaud Arbery, Ahmaud Arbery. I am sorry that we all know your name now; That we will forget it far too soon. I am sorry that the only song they know to sing for you is tragedy. I am sorry that all I can do is write this poem I am sorry that your life has become a metaphor: a house being built, down the road, He liked to mark its progress, dream of building one himself, Eyes shine through windows, Like raccoons in the woods at night, Their faces twisted, pink, and hot, He knows these trees, and their strange fruit, Of thee I sing. after hatred's song is spilled out into the streets and across soft green lawns it cannot be unsung After bullet leaves chamber it cannot be recalled My heart rages for another mother's loss of her son for the blindness for the cover up for the tears not enough to wet the graves of so many lost for the sake of insanity: a black babysitter caring for white children a black professor opening his own front door a young black woman sleeping in her own college lounge a black teen knocking on a door to ask directions his first words: Don't Be Afraid a black boy jogging in the morning There is an essential difference between running and running for your life. I remember my mother, the night she got down on her hands and knees on the frayed rug, Tired of the facade of racial progress Pain too hard to bear, fists pumping out the beat, ""I can't take it anymore."" I don't fear the pick-up trucks It's only the dogs sometimes, when there are two or more, and mean, Who charge out onto the road, hair raised along their backs, barking and growling. Coming up behind me. Looking for a chance to bite. My deepest fear is that I am black and that I will be murdered for it. They are young men simply going about their lives Never, ever again, should a dream be deferred, should a parent have to explain Jim Crow still lives in the hearts and minds of white men, should a young man look over his shoulder at a gun and run only to lose this race. Never, ever AGAIN. We do have a choice and it is an easy choice. We fight to rise above this sin We fight to be a world of one We fight for our humanity because after leaves fall they cannot be reattached to the tree because broken hearts still beat because Justice peeks her head around the corner.

1618215370,2020-05-27 05:00:00,Shuttle Veteran Leads First Human Space Mission Launched From U.S. Since 2011,https://www.wypr.org/post/shuttle-veteran-leads-first-human-space-mission-launched-us-2011,en,False,,245165,wypr.org,http://wypr.org/,"When NASA astronauts launch from the Kennedy Space Center, it will be the first time humans have blasted off from the U.S. since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011. The pilot of that final shuttle mission was Doug Hurley, and he's aboard again Wednesday, ready to make history with the launch of SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule. When Hurley and his crew cleared the tower aboard Atlantis on July 8, 2011, the future of human spaceflight from Florida was uncertain. Getting to space was going to require hitching a ride on Russia's Soyuz capsules lifting off from Kazakhstan. A U.S. replacement ride was at least four years away. In fact, budget cuts and technical challenges delayed NASA's Commercial Crew Program for almost a decade. The $6 billion program aims to launch astronauts to the International Space Station using commercial companies — SpaceX and Boeing. After the final shuttle mission, Hurley worked at NASA's Johnson Space Center to develop the Commercial Crew Program. In 2015, he was selected as one of the first Commercial Crew astronauts. Now he will once again fly to space — something that surprises even him. ""I certainly didn't expect to fly again,"" says Hurley, who also flew on the space shuttle Endeavour in 2009. ""I certainly didn't necessarily have a plan to fly again. And if I did, it would have had to have been a case where somebody would have wanted me to."" Hurley joined NASA in 2000 as part of an astronaut class that called themselves the Bugs, after the Y2K computer glitch of that year. He was selected for his test-flight skills and had clocked over 5,500 hours in more than two dozen military aircraft before joining the space agency. Terry Virts, a former test pilot-turned-astronaut who also joined NASA in 2000, says of Hurley: ""He's just solid. He's not going to make any mistakes."" Virts adds, ""He's going to stay cool no matter what happens. He's definitely a very good choice. I know why our bosses picked him for this job."" The focus of this flight, known as Demonstration Mission 2, will put Hurley's test pilot skills to use. He and co-pilot Bob Behnken are tasked with flying SpaceX's Crew Dragon for the first time. The duo will put the sleek capsule through its paces, flying it using a touch screen and iPads before it docks with the space station. The launch is set for 4:33 p.m. ET Wednesday, and the spacecraft will dock with the station about 18 hours later. The astronauts will spend anywhere from one to four months on the station. Like Hurley, Behnken, another Bug, is a veteran of two shuttle missions, one in 2008 and another two years later. He says Hurley is cool under pressure and dedicated to the mission. ""I always know that Doug is going to be one step ahead of me and ready for whatever's kind of coming in front of us,"" he says. ""He's going to be the one who's ready a second and a half before I am."" The mission is a critical test flight that will — if all goes well — pave the way for more astronauts to fly to the station from the United States. NASA is out of rides to the space station from Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, and Boeing, the second commercial partner, is facing delays getting its capsule certified for launch. Hurley and Behnken will spend 18 hours in space, testing and certifying all of the systems of the Crew Dragon — from flying it in orbit to sleeping on board to testing the spacecraft's toilet. ""You want to know that when it hits the fan, when things don't go as planned, that you have these people with you that will have your back, and that they know you'll have theirs,"" says fellow class of 2000 astronaut Nicole Stott, who is now retired from NASA. ""That's Doug,"" she says. ",0.0

Like any politician, humans aren't the only ones in the middle of an election cycle. One small town in Vermont appoints a mayor of the four legged variety. Meet Lincoln, a Nubian goat and the first pet mayor of Fair Haven, Vermont, elected to office in 2019. Her campaign caused quite the international stir. I got a phone call from Paris. They wanted to know what was going on. And then this year we made the A rumor times in 2019 the first round of the Pet Mayor race. Just because I think it was the first time this was happening. Word spread, especially in France. They were very interested to know what was happening. What's going on? Why's there go being the mayor? Liz Strep, a a reporter for New Station My NBC five covered the goat mayors rise to political fame and her 2020 bid for re election. But don't worry, Fairhaven isn't actually taking executive orders from a goat. The idea electing an animal mayor really started because the school needed a new playground, their playgrounds. I think 30 years old, it's just really not safe. This slide has a big hole in it, and it's just going down. So as a fund raiser, Teoh get a new playground. They thought of this idea. You know, why don't you let a pet mayor and that will spark donations? That's really their only platform, that these candidates are running forest to raise money. So these animals really aren't making any major decisions in the town. They're really more of a mascot to encourage people to donate money to those students. A new playground Last year's election was pretty small. There were, I believe, three candidates. Lincoln ended up winning. She was a young, spunky little goat, very friendly. So I think that really helped her win that election. Lincoln's first days Mayer was very official, though politicians on four legs do come with their challenges. Last year, Lincoln was attending her swearing in ceremony. She had a little bit of an accident. She lost some for marbles. I guess you could say over things a little bit of a commotion there, but it was very entertained. She made her mark. You could say that wasn't one of her final. She, I guess, had a pretty successful first term, which is why she was seeking re election this year. The pet election turned out to be a huge hit both in and out of Fairhaven. So when the 2020 cycle began, competition was fierce because last year was such a big success. And there was so much publicity about Lincoln becoming the town's first pet mayor. A lot of students in the Fairhaven grade school wanted to nominate their own pets, so we had a bunny, a hamster old horse. I think there were five or six dogs. Five acts. There were 18 candidates. There were three main candidates that stood out to voters. Lincoln, the incumbent goat, Sammy, the police canine. And Murphy, the therapy dog. Lincoln at a very successful first term as mayor being an incumbent. A lot of people knew her name already that she was definitely a front runner. She raised. I think, about 1000 or so dollars for the playground, but the goal is $80,000. They really need to raise a lot more money. Murphy thinks reading is important for kids. He thinks having a safe place to play and be outside and get off their phones. This has important. Murphy, a therapy dog, volunteers at the Bear Even grade school, so students were already very familiar with Murphy and Spur. These owner also had several fund raisers during his campaign, though he raised about $500 before the actual town meeting day vote for the school's playground. We were amazed that we were able to raise that much. And then there, Sammy, but police canine Sammy was actually a rescue dog. All the kids were very from there with her, and they're always I wanted her to come in and pay a visit. Do you get to vote today? Welcome to the election stuff Surveying the voters at the polls. A lot of them were very interested in what the name of the animal waas, but also how cute they were. Why do you want to be the war? Said She's so you want 4 to 9 semi because he's true. Why did you want pizzazz? He's cute, and she likes the log on leashes out polling place on town meeting day. A few of the candidates were outside kind of doing a meet and greet with the kids, though I think that could have swayed some of the undecided voters if they had a good experience. He's feeling great. You got to greet all the kids coming to vote. So it was his day. Well, I think she's hungry. That's about yet She's been nibbling on the building. It's a different sort of a day for Everybody Loves Dogs. And then there's even a greater population of love. Police K Nights, Theo Day after a town meeting day, I was in the classroom with a bunch of eighth graders who are counting ballots, and we were there as the results came in. I won't Lincoln doing because I wanted Lincoln personally because he leaves a lot of money for the playground. Last year, I will say this. Eighth grade class WAAS Chris Stan's Class Kristan is Lincoln's owner, so they were a little biased. They really, really were pretty for Lincoln to win. It's my pleasure to announce the winner of the mayoral race fair in Vermont this year. There are a winner is Murphy the dog with 146 votes. When it was announced over the speaker that Murphy had one, there was a little bit of the side. They were a little disappointed, but it didn't take long for them to start cheering and applauding for Murphy. They were very excited that passing the torch on and it's a new year. I think they're looking forward to seeing what Murphy will do with his mayoral seat. I think Murphy will do a great job with the playground fun, so I really wanted him from that store sampling to win. Yeah, I asked him. He didn't care, but he's a new playground and an excuse to see adorable animals weren't the only benefits to the 2020 pet election. The kids were able to learn valuable lessons about exercising their voting rights. Your vote is your voice in the Democratic process. You have a lifetime of voting ahead of you, and I have to take that chance. Every opportunity you get. At the end of the day, this whole pet mayor raises to raise money for the playground, but also to really introduce kids to the importance of voting and taking election seriously, getting to the voting booth and making your voice heard. That's a right that we all have. You know, where U. S citizens and starting that process really early and getting Kate's excited about this process. That's really built goal of all of this. It doesn't matter who wins the playground, the kids, that's what it's about. They haven't reached their goal yet for the playground, but they're really helping that. Murphy can pulls through and get a lot of donations during his time as mayor. And, of course, we had to know. Will this small Vermont town ever hand over the mayoral office to a human? I don't think that there haven will have a human mayor anytime soon. Because Fairhaven has a human town manager, which is essentially sort of the same thing as a mayor. He makes a lot of the big decisions. He oversees that select board. So I think the town government is free, comfortable with just having a town manager. But I think they also really love having a pet mayor. If you'd like to donate to the Fairhaven Grade School Playground Fund, check out the link to the go Fund me in the description box.

1618351111,2020-05-27 08:31:15,Four Minneapolis Officers Fired After Death Of Black Man,https://www.afro.com/four-minneapolis-officers-fired-after-death-of-black-man/,en,True,,661147,Baltimore Afro American,https://www.afro.com/,"By Sean Yoes AFRO Baltimore Editor [email protected] The plight of Black Americans has been fraught with peril since the arrival of the first Africans 400 years ago to the Jamestown colony in 1619. But, few times since uprisings swept across the urban centers of the nation in April 1968, in the aftermath of the murder of Dr. King, has a feeling of Black American rage seemed more palpable than this past terrible week. In the midst of a pandemic that has killed more than 100,000 Americans –the disproportionate number of the dead being people of color, poor people and the elderly — Black Americans endured the reliving of a nightmare, the execution of another unarmed Black man at the hands of law enforcement as he uttered the phrase, “I can’t breathe.” Pastor Seth Martin, a resident of Minneapolis spoke to the AFRO about the May 25 death of George Floyd, the calls for the prosecution of the officers and the tension mounting in the Black community. “This isn’t the first time something like this has happened here,” said Martin. “In fact, Philando Castile is one thing that motivated me to move here. So, I’m heartbroken, but I’m also determined to shine the light on this darkness.” Martin refers to 32-year old Philando Castile, who was killed by a St. Anthony, Minnesota police officer during a traffic stop July 6, 2016. Four White officers from the Minneapolis Police Department have been fired after a video surfaced of one of them with his knee and essentially his full body weight on Floyd’s neck, as the other officers stood by and watched. Floyd was lying on his stomach with his head turned to the side as the unnamed White officer kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for up to eight minutes according to local reports. Floyd, who was being detained for an alleged fraudulent transaction was heard on the phone camera video captured by a bystander repeatedly saying, “I can’t breathe.” He was motionless on the ground for several minutes as the officer kept his knee on his neck. He was officially pronounced dead at a local hospital moments after his body was transported by emergency medical personnel. Floyd pleaded for his life using the same words Eric Garner said at least 11 times prior to taking his last breaths in Staten Island, New York in July 2014; when he was killed by Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is still employed by the New York City Police Department. On May 26, dozens protesting Floyd’s arrest and death confronted members of law enforcement, which sparked arrests and tear gas being hurled at protesters. Recently, a third White man was charged in the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, who was gunned down in February about two miles from his home in a neighborhood outside of Brunswick, Georgia. William “Roddie” Bryan Jr., 50, was arrested on felony murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment charges in Arbery’s death, which has sparked national protests. Yet, some believe the killing of unarmed Black men, whether by the hands of law enforcement or White vigilantes, is related to a recent rise in gun purchases by Black Americans and has compelled some to question the effectiveness of nonviolent protests. Judi Reynolds, a disease intervention specialist and an assistant minister in Baltimore posted about the killing of unarmed Black men via Facebook, following what she describes as a disturbing conversation with her daughter, after she witnessed the video of Floyd’s arrest and death. “I explained to her that some police officers are intentionally killing Black men for sport,” wrote Reynolds. “After we ended our conversation, I looked at my grandson and thought about some vicious White police officer putting his knee on his neck. In 2020, I just don’t understand why there is still so much hate for Black men. My flesh wants me to start packing a pistol, and have a loaded rifle in my home,” she added. “In plain English, God’s Spirit is more powerful than anything we can do. So yes, protect your homes, guard your loved ones, make noise about racial injustice but most of all we need to ask God to intervene without ceasing.”",0.0

George Floyd died Monday after his arrest outside Cup Foods, a Minneapolis restaurant that reported a customer who paid for a meal with a counterfeit $20 bill. Widely circulated videos of the incident show a handcuffed Floyd on the ground with a white officer’s knee on the back of his neck, his pleas for help ignored. “I can’t breathe,” Floyd told the officer. The 46-year-old man died later at the Hennepin County Medical Center. Thousands of protesters descended on a police precinct a day later. Some spray-painted patrol cars, slashed tires and broke windows. Police responded with tear gas canisters after the crowd broke through the gate that protected more vehicles. The standoff lasted until 5:00 a.m., with demonstrators hurling bricks and other objects at police. Protesters had walked more than 2 miles from Cup Foods, organized by activists who would later try to keep the march peaceful. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo fired Officer Derek Chauvin and three other officers who were present. “Being black in America should not be a death sentence. This officer failed in the most basic human sense,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a press conference.

Credit: (Richard Tsong-Taatarii/Star Tribune via AP) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — To the general public, the video of a white police officer pressing his knee into the neck of a shirtless black man prone on the street, crying out for help until he finally stopped moving, was horrifying. Four officers were fired a day after George Floyd’s death, a stunning and swift move by the Minneapolis chief with the mayor’s full backing. But despite their dismissal, whether the incident will be considered criminal, or even excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate. The officers were dismissed soon after a bystander’s video taken outside a south Minneapolis grocery store Monday night showed an officer kneeling on the handcuffed man’s neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving. WARNING: The following video may be disturbing to some viewers.   Mayor Jacob Frey announced the firings on Twitter, saying: “This is the right call.” The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd’s death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. But in the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit, and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed. The officers in the Minneapolis incident haven’t even been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further. The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the department would conduct a full internal investigation, and prosecutors will decide whether to file criminal charges against the officers involved. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office said it was “shocked and saddened” by the video and pledged to handle the case fairly. Part of that investigation will likely focus on the intent of the officers, whether they meant to harm Floyd or whether it was a death that happened in the course of police work. The FBI was investigating whether the officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, whom police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 in a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook. A chokehold is considered a deadly force option and involves someone obstructing the airway. According to the department’s use-of-force policy, officers are to use only an amount of force necessary that would be objectively reasonable. But two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long. They noted the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.” “He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.” In a post on his Facebook page, the mayor, who is white, apologized Tuesday to the black community for the officer’s treatment of Floyd, 46, who worked security at a restaurant. “Being Black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a Black man’s neck. Five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you’re supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense,” Frey posted. Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest. The video starts with the shirtless man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement. Even in the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 100,000 people in the U.S. and prompted police departments around the country to change how they’re doing work, the officers in the video aren’t wearing masks. In some cities, low-level arrests such as attempted forgery are skipped right now. Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.” But Floyd slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics. Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said. At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?” The Hennepin County medical examiner identified Floyd but said the cause of death was pending. Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.” Protesters filled the intersection Tuesday evening in the street where Floyd died, chanting and carrying banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” They eventually marched about 2 1/2 miles to a city police precinct, with some protesters damaging windows, a squad car and spraying graffiti on the building.   A line of police in riot gear eventually confronted the protesters, firing tear gas and projectiles. Some protesters kicked canisters back toward police. Some protesters stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station, and though steady rain diminished the crowd, tense skirmishes stretched late into the evening. Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights and personal injury attorney, said he had been hired by Floyd’s family. The death came amid outrage over the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was fatally shot Feb. 23 in Georgia after a white father and son pursued the 25-year-old black man they had spotted running in their subdivision. More than two months passed before charges were brought. Crump also represents Arbery’s father. ___ Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, contributed to this report.",0.0

1618387969,2020-05-27 14:45:00,George Floyd's Death Stokes Calls For Minneapolis Officers To Be Charged,https://www.wypr.org/post/george-floyds-death-stokes-calls-minneapolis-officers-be-charged,en,False,,245165,wypr.org,http://wypr.org/,"Updated at 2:20 p.m. ET Just one day after the death of a black man whose arrest was recorded and posted on social media by a passerby, Minneapolis is grappling with the fallout that has spread beyond city limits. The disturbing video of Monday night's death — during which a white officer's knee was planted firmly on George Floyd's neck and his desperate calls for help were ignored — has prompted protests in the Minnesota city and demands for charges for the officers involved. At a news conference Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to ""act on the evidence before him"" and press charges on the arresting officer. ""Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail? If you had done it or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now. And I cannot come up with a good answer to that question,"" Frey told a news conference Wednesday. ""We watched for five whole excruciating minutes as a white officer firmly pressed his knee into the neck of an unarmed, handcuffed black man,"" he added, noting that the arresting officer was not practicing a technique condoned by the city's police. ""I saw no threat; I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary."" Frey refrained from specifying what charges he would like to see, citing a desire not to impede investigators. But Floyd's sister Bridgett went one step further on national television earlier Wednesday. ""I would like for those officers to be charged with murder because that's exactly what they did,"" she told the Today show. ""They murdered my brother; he was crying for help."" She said the family, which has retained legal representation, is far from satisfied with the announcement that the four officers in the video have been fired — a swift decision that Frey said was ""the right call."" The Minneapolis Police Department has not publicly confirmed the officers' identities, and it said the FBI is also investigating the circumstances of Floyd's death. The announcement also failed to satisfy protesters who on Tuesday evening thronged to the department's 3rd Precinct, where clashes erupted between demonstrators and law enforcement in riot gear. As Minnesota Public Radio reported, the demonstrators damaged the building and a squad car in a confrontation that eventually saw police firing tear gas into the crowd. ""What we witnessed today was state-sponsored murder, a state-sponsored execution,"" Steven Belton, president of the nonprofit Urban League Twin Cities, said at a gathering of local civil rights leaders earlier Tuesday outside City Hall. ""And what we await to see is whether it's going to become state-sanctioned execution. It'll be sanctioned if nothing is done."" The controversy engulfing Minneapolis is not unfolding in a vacuum. Already a video recorded earlier this year in Georgia — depicting the death of an unarmed black man, who was followed and shot by two white men while out for a jog three months ago — has renewed questions about the conduct of local police, who did not arrest the men until after the video surfaced this month. And this week, a recorded encounter in New York City's Central Park caught fire after it was posted to social media. In the video, a white woman calls the police on a black man, who says he had simply asked her to leash her dog while he was out bird-watching. ""He's recording me and threatening me and my dog,"" she tells emergency operators multiple times as the man recording her keeps his distance. After the video surfaced, the woman was fired by her employer, the investment firm Franklin Templeton. The video recorded in Minneapolis more closely called to mind an earlier death in New York City, however. Like Eric Garner, who died after an officer's chokehold in 2014, Floyd's final words before he appeared to lose consciousness were a plea for help: ""I can't breathe."" Floyd is seen wailing the phrase several times with his face planted on the pavement, his hands apparently cuffed behind his back and a male officer kneeling on his neck. Observers standing nearby are heard telling officers that Floyd's nose was bleeding and that he was dying. The officer and his colleagues show little reaction as the man gradually goes silent. The officer does not lift his weight off Floyd's neck throughout most of the video until medical workers arrive to lift him into an ambulance on a stretcher. The New York City police officer who used the chokehold on Garner, Daniel Pantaleo, was never charged with a crime but was fired last year on a judge's recommendation. The Floyd family's attorney emphasized the link with Garner in comments Wednesday to the Today show. ""It's worse than Eric Garner in many ways,"" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said, ""because you hear the people even pleading with them, 'Please get your knee off his neck. Have some humanity; this is a human being,' "" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement Tuesday, ""There must be a complete and thorough outside investigation into what occurred, and those involved in this incident must be held accountable. Justice must be served for this man and his family, justice must be served for our community, and justice must be served for our country."" ",0.0

""After careful study of developments over the reporting period, I certified to Congress today that Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under United States laws in the same manner as U.S. laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997,"" Pompeo said in a statement released Wednesday. ""No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground."" The secretary announced his decision at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China. President Trump has blamed Chinese authorities for failing to prevent the coronavirus from becoming a global pandemic, noting that his administration is ""not going to take it lightly."" And earlier this month the Senate trained its legislative fire on China, with a unanimously passed bill that could force some foreign companies off U.S. stock exchanges. The State Department also has pushed back hard against China's recent plans for an aggressive new security law that would criminalize behavior in Hong Kong seen as critical of Beijing. In a statement shortly after news of the proposed legislation surfaced, Pompeo called it ""a death knell for the high degree of autonomy."" For more than two decades, the semiautonomous region has been governed under a principle Beijing calls ""one country, two systems,"" which allows Hong Kong certain freedoms from the communist economic and legal systems practiced on mainland China. Partly for that reason, the U.S. treats Hong Kong as separate from the rest of China as long as the city remains sufficiently autonomous. But the relationship between Beijing and Hong Kong's residents has grown increasingly fraught in recent years, with the city periodically erupting into massive demonstration against what protesters and the U.S. call Beijing's attempts to encroach on its freedoms. The region again saw clashes between protesters and riot police last weekend. One of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, Joshua Wong, urged leaders abroad to reconsider whether its ""special trade status can still be held since, once the law is implemented, Hong Kong will be assimilated into China's authoritarian regime, on both rule of law and human rights protections."" Now, that status appears in jeopardy with the Trump administration's reappraisal. ""Hong Kong and its dynamic, enterprising and free people have flourished for decades as a bastion of liberty, and this decision gives me no pleasure,"" Pompeo said Wednesday. ""But sound policymaking requires a recognition of reality. While the United States once hoped that free and prosperous Hong Kong would provide a model for authoritarian China, it is now clear that China is modeling Hong Kong after itself.""

Some spray-painted patrol cars, slashed tires and broke windows. Police responded with tear gas canisters after the crowd broke through the gate that protected more vehicles. The standoff lasted until 5:00 a.m., with demonstrators hurling bricks and other objects at police. Protesters had walked more than 2 miles from Cup Foods, organized by activists who would later try to keep the march peaceful.

Some pulled an American flag from a nearby building and threw it into the blaze. Others added branches pulled from trees. A cinder block structure, on the north side of the park, that had bathrooms and a maintenance office, was engulfed in flames.Several miles north, a separate protest broke out in Northwest D.C., near the Maryland border. The Metropolitan Police Department says there were break-ins at a Target and a shopping center that houses Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue Men’s Store, T.J. Maxx, a movie theater and specialty stores. Police say several individuals have been detained. 10:35 p.m. ETATLANTA — Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed hundreds of demonstrators as a curfew took hold Sunday night, scattering a crowd that had protested for hours in downtown Atlanta over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia.Hundreds of police, National Guard troops and other forces lined up in positions around downtown Centennial Park, a focal point of the weekend of protests.An overnight curfew took hold at 9 p.m. as some on the fringes of what was a largely peaceful afternoon protest were setting off fireworks and burning construction materials near the park. An Associated Press photographer saw police then begin firing many 40 millimeter canisters of tear gas toward the crowd. People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets.As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away. WSB-TV showed footage about an hour later of officers taking people who lingered in the streets into custody, using plastic ties to handcuff them on street corners. 10:05 p.m. ETBIRMINGHAM - People have damaged a confederate monument in Birmingham, Alabama.

Police did not immediately respond to questions about the incident.9:05 p.m. ETMINNEAPOLIS — Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo spoke directly to the Floyd family in a live interview on CNN Sunday.""To the Floyd family, being silent or not intervening to me, you're complicit,"" the chief said in regards to the other officers who were present when former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was kneeling on George Floyd's neck. ""So I don't see a distinction any different."" Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second degree manslaughter. Three other officers were also fired from the department in relation to the incident. When speaking directly to the Floyd family, Arradondo removed his cap and said, in part, ""I would say to the Floyd family that I am absolutely devastatingly sorry for their loss. If I could do anything to bring Mr. Floyd back, I would do that. I would move heaven and Earth to do that. So I'm very sorry.""Watch the powerful interview below: 8:06 p.m. ETWASHINGTON, D.C. — At an intersection in downtown Washington, there is a standoff between protesters and officers in riot gear from the Metropolitan Police Department of Washington.At one point during the standoff, protesters threw water bottles at the police officers who used flash bangs and pepper spray to disperse those demonstrators.Several flash bangs caused the protesters to run.The New York Times has reported that as protesters gathered outside the White House Friday night, President Donald Trump was briefly taken to the White House underground bunker for a period of time, according to a White House official and a law enforcement source.He was there for a little under an hour before being brought upstairs. It's unclear if Melania Trump and Barron Trump were also taken down with him.Trump has repeatedly praised the Secret Service for its handling of the protests outside the White House Friday night.7:26 p.m. ETMINNEAPOLIS — A tractor trailer was driving on a freeway in Minneapolis as protesters swarmed the roadway Sunday evening, aerial footage from CNN affiliate WCCO shows.As the driver tried to speed up, protesters overtook the vehicle and the driver stopped, video shows.It then appears some protesters pulled the driver out of his vehicle before police arrive on scene and the group runs away.According to tweets from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the truck driver was injured, taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries and is under arrest. 7:16 p.m. ETSANTA MONICA — Vandals hit shops in Santa Monica at midday Sunday as armed National Guard soldiers patrolled Los Angeles streets and cities across California declared another night of curfew to prevent violence after unruly demonstrators torched police cars, broke into stores and clashed with officers in riot gear.The unrest in coastal Santa Monica happened not far from a peaceful demonstration near the city’s famous pier and headed for its popular Third Street Promenade shopping area, where they broke into a Gap store and a Vans sneaker store, where they could be seen walking out with boxes of shoes with no police in sight.A woman holding a sign saying “End All Violence” managed to stop a man using a hammer to break the glass on the doors of an REI store.

Shields called it “really shocking to watch.”Officials say the incident came to light via video that circulated online.It shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surround a car being driven by a man with a woman in the passenger seat.

1619067959,2020-05-28 09:52:15,Violence again rocks Minneapolis after man’s death; 1 killed,https://www.localdvm.com/news/national/violence-again-rocks-minneapolis-after-mans-death-1-killed/,en,True,,433540,localdvm.com,http://localdvm.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A man was shot to death as violent protests over the death of a black man in police custody rocked Minneapolis for a second straight night Wednesday, with protesters looting stores near a police precinct and setting fires. Police said they were investigating the death as a homicide and had a suspect in custody, but were still investigating what led to the shooting. Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old George Floyd died on Memorial Day after an officer knelt on his neck until he became unresponsive. News helicopter footage showed protesters milling in streets near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, with some running in and out of nearby stores. A Target, a Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an auto parts store all showed signs of damage and looting. As darkness fell, fire erupted in the auto parts store, and city fire crews rushed to control it. Protesters set other fires in the street. Officers could be seen surrounding the nearby precinct, not attempting to intervene in the looting. Police spokesman John Elder said officers responding to a reported stabbing near the protests found a man lying on the sidewalk with what turned out to be a bullet wound. The man was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Elder said a suspect was in custody but said the facts leading up to the shooting were “still being sorted out.” A man poses for photos in front of a fire at an AutoZone store, while protesters hold a rally for George Floyd in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

A bystander’s cellphone video showed an officer kneeling on Floyd ‘s neck for almost eight minutes as he eventually became unresponsive. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted for calm early Thursday. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. He also asked for the public’s help in keeping the peace. The officer and three others were fired Tuesday, and on Wednesday, Frey called for him to be criminally charged. Protesters also gathered Wednesday evening at the officer’s suburban home as well as the Minneapolis home of Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County prosecutor who would make a charging decision in the case. No violence was reported in those protests. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. Elder said officers from St. Paul, Metro Transit and the state patrol were helping police the area. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers on Wednesday.",0.0
1619082059,2020-05-28 10:38:46,Mayor: Officer who put knee on man’s neck should be charged,https://www.localdvm.com/news/national/mayor-officer-who-put-knee-on-mans-neck-should-be-charged/,en,True,,433540,localdvm.com,http://localdvm.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges against the white police officer seen on video kneeling against the neck of a handcuffed black man who complained that he could not breathe and died in police custody. Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving. “I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white. He later added: “I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired — an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. Conflict erupted again Wednesday at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police. News helicopter video appeared to show looting of nearby stores, including a Target, a Cub Foods and an auto parts store, with no evident police intervention. Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin’s suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door. Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd’s family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete. Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests. “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department’s culture. “One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said. The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota’s two top law enforcement officials — Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black — promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn’t endorse the mayor’s call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out. “I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it’s important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,” Ellison said. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd’s death had “outraged us and people across the country” and that the case “deserves the best we can give.” The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. Floyd’s death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others. Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis “a very, very sad event” and said his administration was going to “look at it.” Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited. Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd’s death was “part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country” and “cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.” It also “sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,” Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, “but I don’t think that’s enough.” A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally. Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told the AP. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store. It was unclear why Floyd was arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks. A Minneapolis Fire Department report shows that paramedics moved Floyd from the scene, and two fire crew members got into the ambulance to help. Medics were doing chest compressions and other lifesaving measures on an “unresponsive, pulseless male,” the report said. Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital. An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to his death. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. Chauvin’s attorney confirmed the officer’s identity on Tuesday. The department identified the other officers Wednesday as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. In calling for charges, the mayor contrasted Floyd’s death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers. “We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,” Frey said. “There’s somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes — every one of which that officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd’s neck.”",0.0

Gretchen Whitmer's COVID-19 emergency orders. The orders include a ban on barbers and hair salons doing business during the declared crisis. Manke's refusal to follow the Democratic governor's shutdown order sparked a May 20 demonstration in front of the Michigan Capitol. Dozens of barbers and hairstylists openly defied the order with free haircuts. The Michigan State Police issued seven citations at the demonstration. Manke's attorney argued, among other things, that the order to pull his barber's license and close his shop violated his First Amendment right to protest the reach of the governor's executive orders. The Court of Appeals disagrees: ""Here, the State has an important governmental interest in containing the spread of COVID-19,"" the decision reads, then continues to say that the governor's executive order is ""directed at that interest and not at any speech or expressive conduct."" The majority decision said Shiawassee Circuit Court Judge Matthew Stewart should have granted the state's request to enforce the shutdown order and that he should not second-guess the actions of Whitmer and her experts as they try to manage a public health crisis. Manke could appeal the decision to the Michigan Supreme Court, but, in the meantime, his license remains suspended. One appeals court judge, Brock Swartzle, issued a partial dissent from two other judges on the panel who made the decision. Within minutes of the decision going public, Swartzle announced he is seeking the Republican nomination to run for a seat on the Michigan Supreme Court. ",0.0

As of Monday, the city’s per capita coronavirus-related deaths — 3.7 per 100,000 residents — was lower than the rates in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties and the District. Yet the city’s next mayor faces the economic damage wrought by the virus — soaring unemployment and massive shortfalls in tax revenue. Since 2014, the year before Freddie Gray’s death in police custody triggered looting and arson, Baltimore has lost 30,000 residents, more than 2,000 of them to homicide. The city’s population fell below 600,000 for the first time in more than a century. AD AD “Baltimore is like a covid patient that had significant underlying issues prior to getting sick,” said the Rev. Andrew Foster Connors, a community organizer. The virus “lays bare all the vulnerabilities. Whether we have the mayoral candidates who address them is the real question.” In the Democratic primary, the contest that matters in this blue city, three of the leading candidates are political outsiders, including Mary Miller, 64, a business executive and largely unknown former Obama administration official. Miller, the only white candidate among the top contenders, has fueled her surge by spending more than $2 million of her own money on her campaign, much of it on television ads. Another main contender is City Council President Brandon Scott, 36, a leader of a new generation of reform-style Democrats seeking to change the culture of City Hall. Scott’s youth and personal story — he grew up in Park Heights, among the city’s toughest neighborhoods — has energized a mix of white and black supporters. The field’s most familiar name — also at the top of the polls — is Sheila Dixon, 66, the former mayor who touts her experience and the crime reductions that occurred during her administration. AD AD Dixon also is known for resigning a decade ago after pleading guilty to embezzling gift cards meant for the poor. If she wins, she would assume an office vacated last year by Catherine Pugh, the former mayor and state lawmaker who pleaded guilty to a fraud scheme involving her self-published children’s books. Pugh’s replacement, Bernard C. “Jack” Young, 65, who moved up from city council president, hopes to keep his current job. But his history of verbal missteps — he once proposed that the city host boxing matches to settle gang beefs — has made him something of a punchline to many voters. As she evaluates the candidates, Aimee Evans Hickman, 43, worries the city will choose poorly, a skittishness reflected in a recent Baltimore Sun poll. More than 20 percent said they were undecided; 41 percent said they could still switch candidates. AD AD “I don’t know anyone who’s really excited about the possibilities,” said Hickman, a mother of three who lives in West Baltimore and sells vintage jewelry. “We all have strong feelings about who we don’t want, but not nearly as positive feelings about who we want. People have serious fatigue about how much they can trust elected officials to do the right thing.” Dixon encountered that skepticism when “Liz from Baltimore” was a caller on a recent WYPR-FM radio show. “I’m offended you’re running,” Liz told the former mayor. “I don’t think you’re trustworthy.” A 'significant unknown' On a recent morning, the line for free coronavirus tests extended from the parking lot of Sacred Heart of Jesus Church along South Conkling Street, then around two corners — 97 people in all, the second to last of whom was Miguel Fuentas, 35, an unemployed electrician. AD AD Fuentas’s fever had broken days before. But he was still feeling sore and was afraid he had the virus. Whatever the case, he said he needed documentation of a negative test result to find work: “They won’t hire you unless you show you’re not sick.” In late April, two weeks after the White House targeted the city as a potential hot spot, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) opened a 250-bed field hospital at Baltimore Convention Center. Only a couple of dozen beds are typically occupied, an indication that city hospitals have not been overwhelmed. Yet, anecdotal evidence, including groups that can still be found hanging out at Fells Point and on corners and outside bodegas in poor neighborhoods, suggests the virus’s full imprint may not have been revealed. AD In mid-May, the first day that Sacred Heart offered coronavirus tests, 50 people were in line by 7 a.m. By early afternoon, medics had to turn away 200 people after using up their allotment of 200 tests. Most of those waiting were Latinos working low-paying, high-risk jobs. “The overwhelming majority appeared sick,” said Bruce Lewandowski, Sacred Heart’s pastor. “One lady collapsed and had to be taken away by ambulance.” Forty congregants are hospitalized with covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, he said. As Memorial Day approached, only about 3 percent of Baltimore’s population had been tested. “Obviously, there’s still a very significant unknown,” said Matt Gallagher, a co-leader of a public-private partnership established by the city, local hospitals and CareFirst to respond to the virus. AD AD More certain is that the virus has altered the dynamics of the election, keeping candidates from meeting voters who will also select a new city council president and, possibly, a new comptroller. That office is occupied by Joan Pratt, a onetime Pugh business partner, who is being challenged in her race for a seventh term. “There’s going to be change in Baltimore, we just hope it’s to our advantage,” said Marvin “Doc” Cheatham, the leader of a neighborhood association near where the 2015 riot began. Cheatham said he detects little interest in the election among neighbors who have largely “lost faith” in local leaders. “Our problem is we elect the same candidates over and over and we don’t get results,” he said. The candidate whom Cheatham most praised was Thiru Vignarajah, 43, an Ivy League-educated former prosecutor who promises to reduce crime. Vignarajah’s support waned after news that he had asked a police sergeant last fall to turn off a video camera recording their exchange during a late-night traffic stop. AD AD Yet Vignarajah remains viable in a fractured race that is all the more unpredictable because the governor has ordered that ballots be mailed to every household. To limit the potential spread of the virus, only a few in-person polling stations will be open. As the spate of shootings dominated Memorial Day weekend, Vignarajah held a news conference and said he would work to cut homicides — more than 300 in each of the past five years — to less than 200 in his first term. “If I don’t, vote me out,” he said, standing with several mothers who have lost children to gun violence. The weekend killings also drew the attention of Brandon Scott, who posted on social media that he had to console his grandmother after a man was shot outside her house over the weekend and bled on her truck. “Nothing will rattle you more,” he wrote. AD By then, T.J. Smith, 42, a former police spokesman who also is running, had posted videos from two crime scenes he had visited. “The biggest threat to Baltimore and to young people in Baltimore is not covid-19,” he told viewers. “It’s the violence.” Past experiences On a recent Wednesday, Young announced that all special summer events — including July 4 fireworks and festivals celebrating the arts and African American culture — were canceled through August because of the pandemic. “We don’t want people to constantly get sick,” Young said, behind a rostrum equipped with a bottle of Purell hand sanitizer. “We don’t want people to constantly die.” The demands of managing the virus have made it difficult for the mayor to campaign. During a debate, his cellphone rang while a rival spoke. “You know, I’m still running the city,” he said when the moderator asked him to mute his phone. Young got 5 percent in the recent Sun poll, a result that “puzzled” him. “I don’t know who they’re talking to — nobody polled me, nobody polled members of my family,” he said. North of City Hall, near the Pimlico racetrack, Bradley Scott, 73, has a wide “Sheila Dixon for Mayor” sign outside his house. He waved off concerns about her past. “I’m comfortable with her,” he said. “She knows the bad guys and the good guys, and if she doesn’t, she knows people who do. She’s out among the people.” Over in Hampden, Dionna Blackwell, 33, a medical assistant who is six months pregnant, paused between scoops of a snow cone and said Dixon represents a past she’s not interested in revisiting. “We need a new face,” she said, still deciding who that should be. Robert Koulish, 59, a political science professor, sat in his backyard in southwest Baltimore, itemizing the city’s past pain as he contemplated the future.",0.0

George Floyd, 46, died Monday evening after police responded to a report of a man attempting to use forged documents at a grocery store. A graphic nine-minute video of the incident was widely circulated in the media and online. It shows a white officer pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck behind a squad car. While lying facedown on the road, Floyd repeatedly groans and says he can’t breathe. MFD Incident Report: Medics Worked On ‘Unresponsive, Pulseless’ George Floyd After Mpls.

People in the gathering crowd plead for the officers to check Floyd’s pulse. The officer on Floyd’s neck does not lift his knee until medical personnel arrive and carry him to an ambulance. An ambulance brought Floyd to Hennepin Healthcare, where he later died, police say. Four police officers who were at the scene have been fired and the FBI has opened an investigation. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has called for criminal charges to be filed against the officer who was seen in the video pressing Floyd to the pavement with his knee on the man’s neck.

Video by Chris Juhn/Zenger The previous night had seen mostly peaceful protests that drew an estimated 4,000 people to the streets. Looters emptied a liquor store, and tear gas canisters flew as demonstrators broke squad car windows. Twenty-four hours later furious orange flames pockmarked the city blocks surrounding the Third Police Precinct where Officer Derek Chauvin was based. The white patrolman killed George Floyd, a black man, during an arrest Monday night over an accusation of retail forgery. Chauvin was a 19-year police veteran whose career has been pockmarked with other allegations of excessive force including three shootings. One was fatal. As his past percolated through local and national news media, the protests turned more violent. Fires consumed an auto parts store, a Wendy’s restaurants and an affordable housing complex that was expected to house hundreds. Sprinkler systems saved at least two grocery stores from burning to the ground, but other businesses were at the mercy of the flames. Looters stripped bare what wasn’t consumed by fire, laying waste to both corner shope and cavernous Target stores. Reports circulated of business owners pacing rooftops with loaded shotguns. Widely seen video footage showed Chauvin kneeling on the 46-year-old Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes as he complained that he couldn’t breathe and pleaded for his life. Floyd lost consciousness at the scene, and was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. The FBI and law enforcement agencies in Minnesota have launched investigations. The city of Minneapolis fired Chauvin and three other officers. Mayor Jacob Frey called for criminal charges on Wednesday, hours before the riots escalated. “Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” he asked. “We cannot turn a blind eye. It is on us as leaders to see this for what it is and call it what it is.” Some protesters made their way to Chauvin’s home on Wednesday, scrawling the word “murderer” on his driveway in chalk. Others wrote “I can’t breathe” in red spray paint, the words Floyd is heard saying on the video of his last conscious moments.

1619363468,2020-05-28 13:35:34,America’s Oldest Civil Rights Organization – The Prince Hall Masons,https://www.afro.com/americas-oldest-civil-rights-organization-the-prince-hall-masons/,en,False,,661147,Baltimore Afro American,https://www.afro.com/,"By Larry S. Gibson The Prince Hall Masons are American’s oldest civil rights organization. The American colonies declared independence from England in 1776. Prince Hall had become a Mason a year earlier, when in 1775, he and 14 other free black men were initiated into the Craft by British FreeMasons stationed in Boston Harbor. Prince Hall and his brothers immediately began their advocacy for the rights for African Americans. For example, in 1777, one year after the Declaration of Independence, Prince Hall and other leaders began to formally petition the Massachusetts House of Representative to abolish slavery in that state and to open schools for black youngsters. After the conflict between the new nation and England ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, and the British troops had left our shores, Prince Hall successfully petitioned the Grand Lodge in England for a full Masonic charter, with the authority to establish new chapter in America. Prince Hall and his brothers began to dramatically expand their presence. They chartered Prince Hall Masonic lodges in New England, New York, and Pennsylvania. Then, African Friendship Lodge #6 was established here in Baltimore on February 2, 1825, becoming the first Prince Hall lodge below the Mason Dixon line. As Prince Hall Masons spread, so did their opposition to slavery. Many Masonic leaders became prominent abolitionists; and several lodges provided became important stations along the Underground Railroad When the Civil War promised an end to slavery, Boston Grand Master Lewis Hayden and other Masons provided leadership in recruiting blacks to serve in the U.S Colored Troops. Masons were very prominent among the 10,000 black Marylanders who fought for the Union. Major Martin Dulany, a Prince Hall Mason, became the highest-ranking black officer in the Union Army. After the Civil War, many black soldiers purchased their guns from the U.S. Army and brought their weapons home. They organized black militia groups that protected communities from violence at the hands of the former supporters of slavery. Masons led many of these units. In Baltimore, they had names such as the Oakland Invincible Guards, the Hugh Lennox Bond Militia, and the Lincoln Zouaves, who had their armory at the corner of Howard and Franklin streets. When the 15th Amendment was ratified, guaranteeing blacks the right to vote, a massive celebratory parade was held here in Baltimore on May 19, 1870. This was the largest demonstration that black people had ever conducted in this country. The parade took the 10,000 marchers and floats all over Baltimore and within four blocks of this building. Many organizations participated. The lead organizer of that march was Prince Hall Grand Master Isaac Myers. The lithograph images of that parade show 15 men on horseback leading the parade, dressed in black suits with top hats. Those were Prince Hall Knights Templar from Baltimore and Philadelphia. As we moved into the 20th century, black Masons continued to provide our people leadership and direction, with men like W.E. B. Dubois, Booker T. Washington, and Paul Robeson. When we began to use the courts to secure our civil rights, the most effective legal advocate was a Baltimore Mason, Thurgood Marshall, who became the most important American lawyer of the Twentieth Century. But Thurgood Marshall did not have to fight the legal battles alone. In almost every state in the South, he was joined by a local attorney, who in most cases was also a Mason. For example, the Thurgood Marshall of South Carolina was Harold Bouleware. In Alabama, it was Arthur D. Shores of Birmingham. In Tennessee, it was Z. Alexander Looby of Nashville. All of them were Masons. The great civil rights lawyer of Oklahoma was Grand Master Amos T. Hall, who for 17 years was the President of the Conference of Grand Masters. Masonic leadership in civil rights has not been limited to lawyers. We know the names – Medgar Evers, Benjamin Hooks, A. Phillip Randolph, and currently Congressman John Lewis , and our beloved late Congressman Elijah Cummings. In addition to providing lawyers, leaders, and troops, Masonic lodges also supplied important material and logistical support to civil rights organizations and efforts. Many NAACP branches, Urban League offices, and other civil rights organizations were housed in Masonic Temples. When it was necessary to get the word out, often the Masons had the only functioning copying machine. Some will remember the mimeograph and ditto machines. And yes, the Masons supplied money. Lots of it. I have, for the past two years, been assembling the record of the extraordinary amount of money the Prince Hall Masons provided to civil rights organizations, particularly the NAACP Legal and Educational Defense Fund. So far, I am up to more than $400,000 in just the 1950s. That would be more than three million in present day dollars. This money came from local lodges, Grand Lodges, the Conference of Grand Masters, and from Prince Hall affiliated groups, including the Eastern Star and Shriners. Thurgood Marshall frequently said that his work on landmark cases, such as Brown v Board of Education, would have been far less effective were it not for the support of the Masons. In my next book, I plan to document these special contributions of America’s Oldest Civil Rights Organization. Larry S. Gibson is a law professor and a Sovereign Grand Inspector General 33° of the Prince Hall Masons",0.0

Tim Walz called in the National Guard as a wounded Minneapolis braced for more violence Thursday, one day after rioting over the death of a handcuffed black man in police custody reduced parts of one neighborhood to a smoking shambles, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The unrest ravaged several blocks in the Longfellow neighborhood, with scattered rioting reaching for miles across the city. It was the second consecutive night of violent protests following the death of George Floyd, who gasped for breath during a Monday arrest in which an officer kneeled on his neck for almost eight minutes. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd can be heard pleading that he can’t breathe until he slowly stops talking and moving. Another protest was announced for Thursday evening near county offices downtown. Some stores in Minneapolis and the suburbs planned to close early, fearing more strife. The city shut down its light-rail system and planned to stop all bus service “out of concern for the safety of riders and employees,” a statement said. Around midday Thursday, the violence spread to a Target store several miles away in the Midway neighborhood of St. Paul, where police said 50 to 60 people rushed the store and attempted to take merchandise. St. Paul police and state patrol squad cars later blocked the entrance, but looting then spread to shops along nearby University Avenue, one of St. Paul’s main commercial corridors, and other spots in the city. St. Paul spokesman Steve Linders said authorities have been dealing with unrest in roughly 20 different areas throughout the city. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement, and on preventing this from ever happening again. We can all be in that fight together,” St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter tweeted. Walz called for widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect. George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction,” Walz said. By Thursday morning in Minneapolis, smoke rose from smoldering buildings in the Longfellow neighborhood, scene of the worst violence. In a strip mall across the street from the police’s 3rd Precinct station, the focus of the previous night’s protests, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. But others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence: “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage or looting. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. Protests also spread to other U.S. cities. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Memphis police blocked a main thoroughfare after a racially mixed group of protesters gathered outside a police precinct. The situation intensified later in the night, with police donning riot gear and protesters standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of officers stationed behind a barricade. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. There was no sign of police at the destroyed shopping center, though a couple dozen were outside the precinct house. One man standing outside the building was using a bullhorn to shout. “I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe. Mama, I can’t breathe,” repeating some of Floyd’s pleas for relief. Across from the precinct, someone had spray-painted the sidewalk in red: “Where’s humanity?” The 46-year-old Floyd died as police arrested him outside a convenience store after a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death and making the case a priority. The announcement came a day after President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating, with a probe focused on whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. The officer who kneeled on Floyd and three others were fired Tuesday. The next day, the mayor called for him to be criminally charged. Frey appealed to Gov. Tim Walz to activate the National Guard, a spokesman confirmed Thursday. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Walz tweeted for calm Wednesday night, calling the violence “an extremely dangerous situation” and urging people to leave the scene. The last time the Minnesota National Guard was called out to deal with civil unrest was in a backup role during the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul. The most comparable situation to the current disturbances happened when the Guard was called up to deal with the riots in Minneapolis in 1967, a summer when anger over racial inequalities came to a boil in many cities across the country. The Minnesota National Guard was also called out during protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and early 1970s and during a 1986 strike by Hormel meatpackers in Austin.",0.0

The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn't provide a number.“No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians.The protests stretched for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down.“Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor's mother. “As Breonna's mother says let's be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice.”Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.Attention on Taylor's death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February.Thursday's demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody.Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor's family.“Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna's name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.”Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up around Louisville City Hall. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd.Chants from protesters early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.”",0.0

That was quite a scene of what you've just endured for the past hour. Can you tell us what happened? Well, we saw a lot of it play out on TV there. There seemed to be a little bit of confusion as to what what was supposed to or what was allowed to happen. Now, well, as we're reporting, we had been in verbal contact. At least it seemed, with some of the police officers saying, All right, where can we be? We have heard we played some of it as they were giving out commands for people to clear the area. And we saw that as protesters completely cleared out. And that, of course, came after there was an hour and 1/2. Or at least where we're standing, where there was no sort of police presence. So as people came down, we saw them walking down the block, and whether repress or not, we wanted to make sure we were out of the way. So you so we basically stepped onto the corner is where we were. And I think the moment before the arrest actually happened was we saw at least 11 protester or Allison, who was not media sort of run past us. And that person was cornered by State Patrol was the main unit that seemed to be there. And after that person was apprehended, they then turned toward us now, and that was the first moment I could say that police had gotten behind us. So in a sense, we were sort of surrounded by state patrolman, and it seemed like Minneapolis police officers as well. But again, it was that moment where all of a sudden someone runs past and there are already on edge based on the absolute destruction that's all around them. And that arrests happened just right in front of the Minneapolis Third Precinct. That, of course, went up in flames last night. Omar, I'm not sure you know this, but our cameras were not only rolling the whole time you were taken into custody, but the cameras continue to roll. Frankly, for the entire ride to the precinct, we could see the picture for the whole time. First of all, let me also say, Omar, what an amazing job you did throughout that your composure and your ability to keep your cool is a testament to your professionalism. Um, which we already knew about by how great of a job you're doing covering the story on the streets there. You and your team did a terrific job. Now what we did not hear, even though we saw the transportation, is from the moment you were lead away until the moment you were just released. So can you please tell us what took place while you were in custody? Well, everyone to their credit, was pretty cordial after that happened. So it seemed I was actually talking to the officer that was leading me away. I was like, And then we're gonna be out here for the next few days. What is the guidance of where we should be? If you don't want us that close, where should we? Because we're under the impression that that was OK. And he said, Look, I don't know, man. I'm just following orders, so I don't know who is potentially giving that order in that particular moment. But as far as the people that were leading me away, they there was no animosity there. They weren't they weren't violent with me. We're having conversation about just how crazy this week has been for every single part of the city. And like I mentioned, a lot of these people are on edge. And as we were walking by, we saw a person on the edge of sort of the perimeter that they had formed. And this wasn't a protester. This was just a a random it seemed citizen, who was saying, Hey, I need to get back into my place over there. And where were you when this neighborhood? Completely about the short. I mean, we saw where they were. They were in the middle of what became a focal point of anger, passion, violence, even at times and there they were forced to retreat. And then this morning, literally within a matter of minutes, we saw all of them swarm back in clearing out these protesters from the city level. That's we saw the fire department and Police Department come in. And then the State Patrol was advancing as we're seeing up that street toward our location. Now, where we were standing basically to my right, was where all the protesters were outside or in front of the the building that was on fire and into our left was where they were advancing. So we were basically just going to try and step back and let them continue to advance down the street. But again, you saw what unfolded there. But as far as what happened in between again, they were They were pretty cordial. Once we're in the trucks as well. They were were downtown. Obviously, this is the Hennepin County Public Safety Building here. They're all pretty pretty good with us. Onda conversation. Well, that's a relief, Omar, because you could not have been more professional. You were doing your job by the book. You presented your credentials. You told them that you were a journalist. You told them that you were within and you told them you were. They were. You were live on the air. I mean, you did them the courtesy of explaining that we were live on the air at that moment. And I'm just wondering, after you and your crew were arrested, at what point did they? I mean, did they ever say sorry, that was a mistake. Or when they released you, Was there an explanation of that? That had all been a big misunderstanding or mistake and you're allowed to report there. That conversation may have happened above some of the people that were with for us. It was literally a situation off. Tell me who you are. Me as far as identification purposes than they left. And they came back and said, You're with CNN, Correct? Yes. And then we explained that to other team members that were with me on three, including the security that we that we had hired for this. And then they left, came back and then let us out of the van, were inside the van, handcuffed the whole time. And then we were sat down, waited for a little bit more, and then from there, that was when they eventually came back with our with our belongings that they confiscated. Over the course of this, they had they unclipped our handcuffs. And then that is when we were let out. And again, it's answer your question. There was no sort of sorry. This is a big misunderstanding, blah, blah, blah, because it seems that conversation may have happened. But it didn't happen with us in particular, but also is the difference of jurisdiction. Just just one more question because it was It was a nerve racking moment for all of us watching. You know, Bakari Sellers just described watching it and saying that it was really emotional and heart pumping for him because he was scared for you and other people watching. Given the backdrop of everything that's happening in Minneapolis, he was scared for you at this moment when you were being taken into custody. You know, I should also let you know that Josh Campbell, who was reporting a block or two away from you, was not taken into custody. He was treated quite politely. Were you scared when this was happening? And do you have any idea why you were arrested and not Josh Kim? Well, there was a moment, I would say, minutes after it happened, where things started to sink in a little bit. I think I don't have to tell you Alison or John that sometimes when you're in this job in these scenarios, there's a lot of adrenaline pumping. You're trying to focus and balance so many different factors. In a case like this, I'm tryingto balance what the actual story is, how the story line is advancing while also trying to be aware of our surroundings, which at times can get dangerous. So there's that mentality, and then the arrest happened. I was still trying to communicate with you all as this was going on, because I was just confused as you. We have been showing our credentials throughout this entire week, and especially in the moments leading up to that. So I couldn't really understand what was going on. But as we were walking away and you're sort of taking in the entire neighborhood that had been completely decimated again from the passion of the protesters and unfortunately, some of the rioting and looting that we had seen. It did cross my mind that what is really happening here, and the one thing that gave me a little bit of comfort was that it happened on live TV. There has been this When you talk within the community about, let's just say what's happened with George Floyd. There's always a discussion that what's happening isn't new. It's being filmed, and that speaks to the power of having something happen on camera because you can have people speak up for you without you saying anything. And that gave me a little bit of comfort knowing that you guys saw what was happening. I was living what was happening, and the country was seeing what was happening unfold in real time, right before their eyes. You don't have to doubt my story. It's not filtered in any sort of way. You saw it for your own eyes, and that gave me a little bit of comfort, but it definitely was nerve racking a certain point.

A bitter, retching sickness in my stomach. Sick in my heart. Like you, I watched in utter disbelief the slow motion video murder of George Floyd, 46 and black. What got to me most was not just the relaxed, in charge attitude of the murderer, knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck, but the casual, business-as-usual manner of the second officer strolling about, as if to keep traffic moving and everyone calm as this black man goes down. Were I a racial justice activist, I’d throw the list at you… names of young black men (and some children) dead at the hands of the authorities, or, in the case of Ahmaud Aubrey, by racist vigilantes. In 2020. In America. But I’m not that activist, and I can’t recite the names — but I’ve watched the same news reports as you have for far too long. The horror of George Floyd’s murder broke this camel’s back. I have no idea how to the change the world, how to make this go away. But I am not sitting still for it. My wife Brenda and I will be standing for George Floyd with sign in hand — LET AMERICAN BREATHE — on Marlboro Road in Easton from 10 till 11 AM tomorrow, Saturday, May 30th. Why? Because we need to do something for god’s sake, not just sit here reading the paper, saying “ain’t it awful.” Will doing this change a thing? Like you, I doubt it — but Dr. King thought otherwise. I am too old to not do what’s needed, what’s right — and that’s very simple: stand up for George Floyd. We’d welcome company. Anyone else whose sick at heart and needs to say it aloud — please come. WEAR A COVID MASK. MAKE A LINE SIX FEET APART. At 10 am, we’ll be at the corner of Marlboro Road that is the very closest to McDonald’s — because on Saturday morning, it’s where the traffic is. If anyone else shows up, let’s just make a line — everyone six feet apart — down the whole length of Marlboro Road … fall in at the end, it’s that simple. Bring any sign you want — just make some reference to “Geo. Floyd” (so folks don’t think this demonstration relates to the pandemic, a point that occurred to my wife). Or bring no sign at all. Just come and stand for Mr. Floyd. If you think this invitation does not include YOU, you are wrong. Elderly — all the better: you know the bitter failure of anti-racist efforts since Selma (and bring a chair). Young — great, you can help salvage the future of America, if that’s doable. Rich — I sure hope so, negating the insidious idea that some “overclass” is happy to tolerate such suppression. Poor — speak out with your own voice, too long suppressed. Black — nothing this old white guy can say will add to the urgency. White—are we not the ones who need to stand up visibly, on the roadside, for Mr. Floyd, to say his death was as wrong as wrong can be? Partisan — leave it at home; the air every American has the right to breathe is neither blue nor red. The Religious — if not now, when? Just please come out, for all that is decent in America. Be orderly — a vigil like this (whether 1 or 5 or 50) wields its own power; it needs no shouting, no disorder (and of course never, ever anything like violence). It’s not a march, not interfering with a soul … unless that’s the very thing that’s touched by our action. Even here in the rural Mid-Shore, we need to stand witness to this horrid crime, refuse to be silent and accept it. Dan Watson is the former chairman of Bipartisan Coalition For New Council Leadership and has lived in Talbot County for the last twenty-five years.",0.0

PLEASE GO HOME, BE SAFE, AND BE READY TO KEEP FIGHT Advertisement Breonna Taylor’s mother calls for peace amid continued Louisville protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Looking to defuse anger after gunfire wounded at least seven people at a protest, the mother of a black woman killed by police urged protesters Friday to continue demanding justice but do so “without hurting each other.""Breonna Taylor was shot and killed by Louisville Metro Police in March while officers were conducting a raid at her apartment. The FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death.Hundreds flocked downtown Thursday night, and on Friday, it happened again — people demanding justice in the death of Taylor, as well as two minority men recently killed.Details of the case remained quiet for several weeks, but gained national attention after video of the Ahmaud Arbery shooting death in Georgia was made public. Activists across the country began speaking out about the deaths of unarmed black citizens at the hands of police and/or racist white people.In March, Taylor was shot at least eight times when three officers forcibly entered her apartment to serve a search warrant in a narcotics investigation. The department said the men announced themselves and returned gunfire when Taylor's boyfriend fired at them.But in a wrongful death lawsuit, Taylor's mother says the officers didn't knock at all and should've called off their search because the suspect they sought had already been arrested.Officers didn't find drugs in her apartment when they entered, Taylor's mother said in the lawsuit.In the weeks leading up to Thursday’s violent protest, Taylor’s family called for the LMPD officers involved in the case to be relieved of their duties and charged. Activists held a candlelight vigil, a parade and a wreath-laying ceremony to bring attention to the case. The events were all held peacefully, and Taylor's mother said she would like it to remain that way. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported.A police officer was seen on camera during a WAVE-TV broadcast firing what appeared to be pepper bullets directly at the camera crew.“I'm getting shot! I'm getting shot!” WAVE-TV reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera. She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away.Seven people were shot during Thursday’s rally.

1620207464,2020-05-29 06:13:00,Cliven Bundy Armed Standoff Case Going Back To Court,https://www.wypr.org/post/cliven-bundy-armed-standoff-case-going-back-court,en,False,,245165,wypr.org,http://wypr.org/,"It's been more than two years since Cliven Bundy left the federal courthouse in downtown Las Vegas a free man. His arm around his wife, Carol Bundy, the Nevada rancher was defiant. ""We're not done with this,"" Bundy told reporters in January 2018. ""If the federal government comes after us again we will definitely tell 'em the truth."" On Friday, the Justice Department will try to come after the Bundys again, when federal prosecutors will appeal for a retrial over a 2014 armed standoff between Bundy, his militia and federal agents who had come to round up the rancher's cows that were illegally grazing on federal land. The government's case against Cliven Bundy, his sons, Ammon and Ryan and a Montana militiaman named Ryan Payne, collapsed after a judge declared a mistrial in December 2017. Bundy and his men were accused of conspiracy against federal agents and other charges for their role in the tense standoff which later became a symbol over the fight against federal control of public lands. ""If there is no successful prosecution, it's going to encourage a lot of anarchists like the Bundys to take actions that not only are a threat to themselves but threats to the public at large,"" said Pat Shea, who served as BLM director during the Clinton administration. Retrial effort criticized For their part, the Bundys and their supporters appear puzzled that the federal government is even pursuing a retrial. ""What's really ironic and frankly I think disgusting is that the Trump Justice Department is the one that allowed the U.S. attorney in Nevada to take the appeal,"" said Larry Klayman, Cliven Bundy's attorney. After all, President Trump recently pardoned two Oregon ranchers whose fight with federal land managers inspired Cliven Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, to lead a separate, armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016. Federal prosecutors mostly failed to get convictions in that Oregon case and have been widely criticized for bungling the Nevada trial. Judge Gloria Navarro dismissed the case and later declared a mistrial after ruling federal prosecutors ""deliberately misled"" defense attorneys and the court by failing to provide evidence from surveillance cameras and to disclose the existence of federal snipers near the ranch in the days leading up to the April 2014 standoff. The U.S. attorney's office in Nevada declined an interview request by NPR. But court filings indicate prosecutors will likely argue Friday that their missteps in the 2017 trial were ""inadvertent,"" and in particular they say they were trying to balance disclosing Bureau of Land Management surveillance footage with protecting witnesses against violence. Klayman, who is himself a controversial conservative activist and was once fixture in the ""Birther"" movement, says the DOJ is being hypocritical. He says the investigation against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was recently dropped, but not his clients. ""If you're one of the Washington elite and establishment in the nation's capital, you get special treatment,"" Klayman said. ""If you're Cliven Bundy and his sons and the peaceful protesters, basically you don't."" Most of the federal agents and land managers who were at the 2014 standoff say it was anything but a peaceful protest. Photos and social media posts showed militia training their rifles on armed BLM officers who had come to round up Bundy's cattle. Cliven Bundy has refused to recognize the federal government's ownership of millions of acres of public land — including in Nevada. The rancher has consequently not paid federal fees owed for grazing his cows on land near the Lake Mead National Recreation Area since the 1990s. Pandemic ""resuscitates"" movement Retired federal land managers like Pat Shea have expressed outrage over the government's continued failure to prosecute the Bundys, whose cows continue to graze — for free — on land that's now protected as a national monument. The Bundys' original dispute over grazing goes back decades, stemming from tensions between ranchers and environmentalists and the city of Las Vegas, as it began rapidly expanding into a protected desert tortoise's habitat. Bundy was seen as the last rancher in southern Nevada who refused to get out of the business. But in the years since, his critics say the family's fight has devolved into far right extremism, and a widely debunked legal theory that counties and states, not the federal government, should own public land. ""It's like the COVID-19 virus, they mutate as to their belief system so much that you can never tell what they're going to advocate,"" Shea said. ""They are a danger to themselves and a danger to everyone else they come in contact with."" Indeed, the pandemic has lately brought an opportunity to breathe new life to the Bundys and their self-described patriot movement that had been seen as starting to fade. Ammon Bundy and some of the family's followers have been traveling across the West leading protests against coronavirus public health restrictions, protests that thus far haven't drawn huge numbers. At one recent march in Washington state that was streamed on Facebook, activist Kelli Stewart decried the business closures: ""Come on guys, this is the American way, open rebellion to tyrannical laws, we're not slaves."" A rebellious fight against tyranny, or justice against a family that has flaunted the law for decades, that's a question now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The court takes up the appeal for a retrial in USA vs. Bundy in a virtual session on Friday. ",0.0
1620207457,2020-05-29 08:18:00,"Twitter Hides Trump's Tweet About Minneapolis, Saying It Glorifies Violence",https://www.wypr.org/post/twitter-hides-trumps-tweet-about-minneapolis-saying-it-glorifies-violence,en,False,,245165,wypr.org,http://wypr.org/,"Updated at 11:39 a.m. Twitter has placed a warning on a tweet from President Trump, in which the president blamed unrest in Minneapolis on ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter said Trump's post violates its policy about ""glorifying violence."" Trump's message on Twitter came during a night of protests and looting in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd, a black man, after he was pinned to the ground for several minutes by a white police officer. Trump said he would ""send in the National Guard"" to restore order. ""I can't stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis,"" Trump said early Friday. ""A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right."" He added: ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"" ....These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2020 Twitter hid the second of those messages with a warning but added that it ""has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible."" The official White House Twitter account retweeted the language from the president's hidden post. Twitter placed a warning message on that post, as well. We have placed a public interest notice on this Tweet from @realdonaldtrump. https://t.co/6RHX56G2zt — Twitter Comms (@TwitterComms) May 29, 2020 Trump responded Friday, saying Twitter was doing ""nothing about all of the lies & propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party."" Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies & propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party. They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives & the President of the United States. Section 230 should be revoked by Congress. Until then, it will be regulated! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2020 Dan Scavino, a top White House aide who helps manage Trump's Twitter account, lashed out against the social media company using an expletive. ""Twitter is targeting the president of the United States 24/7, while turning their heads to protest organizers who are planning, plotting, and communicating their next moves daily on this very platform,"" Scavino tweeted. ""Twitter is full of"" s--- - ""more and more people are beginning to get it."" The president's tweets about the situation in Minneapolis and Twitter's response to it bring to a head two major stories that have dominated the news this week. In the first, a white officer appears to shove Floyd's face into the pavement with his knee for at least seven minutes on Monday evening. Several minutes into the video, Floyd's pleas for help go quiet. Floyd was reported dead later that night. The Minneapolis Police Department swiftly fired the four police officers shown in the disturbing video. The U.S. Justice Department said it has made the investigation into Floyd's death ""a top priority."" But protesters weren't placated. The 3rd Precinct police building in Minneapolis was set on fire Thursday night. Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order activating the Minnesota National Guard to help restore peace. In the second story, Twitter fact-checked a tweet by Trump that said mail-in voting leads to fraud, prompting the president to sign an executive order Thursday aimed at limiting the broad legal protections enjoyed by social media companies. But legal experts said they doubt the move would have any practical effect on the tech giants. Prior to this week, Twitter had not fact-checked the president, nor hidden any of his messages on the platform. ",0.0
1620207451,2020-05-29 10:11:00,Minneapolis Seethes Over George Floyd's Death As Trump Calls Protesters 'THUGS',https://www.wypr.org/post/minneapolis-seethes-over-george-floyds-death-trump-calls-protesters-thugs,en,False,,245165,wypr.org,http://wypr.org/,"Updated at 10:56 p.m. ET Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer involved in George Floyd's death on Monday, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced the charges Friday, shortly after Chauvin was taken into custody by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The announcement comes days after the release of a video that shows Chauvin's knee pressed firmly on the black man's neck for at least seven minutes. That video has inspired outrage nationwide and unrest in Minneapolis and had led to Chauvin's firing as well as that of three other officers seen in the video. Asked why Chauvin wasn't arrested earlier — something demanded by protesters and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — Freeman said his office moved as quickly as possible in its investigation. He added that the three other former officers remain under investigation and that he anticipates charges for them, too. The Department of Justice is also conducting an investigation on ""a separate and parallel track,"" U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Friday in a statement. ""Both state and federal officers are working diligently and collaboratively to ensure that any available evidence relevant to these decisions is obtained as quickly as possible,"" Barr said. Those investigations, coupled with the officers' firings, has so far failed to satisfy the protesters who had gathered for a third night Thursday in Minneapolis. Some of them stormed the 3rd Police Precinct, the closest precinct to the site of Floyd's arrest, setting fire to that building after police withdrew in an attempt to mitigate tensions. Rioters burned and looted other buildings in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The region has seethed since the release of the video depicting Floyd's arrest, which shows Floyd crying for help before falling silent, while bystanders shout that he's dying. The officer did not remove his knee until paramedics showed up to move Floyd's unresponsive body into an ambulance. He was reported dead later Monday night. In an attempt to avoid another night of chaos, officials ordered a nighttime curfew in Minneapolis and St. Paul beginning at 8 p.m. local time Friday and Saturday nights and continuing until 6 a.m., although the curfew was widely ignored. Here is the latest on the situation: Floyd's family: ""We want a first-degree murder charge"" Floyd's family said that prosecutors have made ""a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice,"" in a statement issued shortly after the announcement that Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. But they feel that authorities haven't gone far enough. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested. We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer,"" the family said in a statement shared by their attorney. In Minnesota, a third-degree murder conviction can result in up to 25 years in prison, while murder in the first degree brings a possible life sentence. ""The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw,"" the family added, ""and is spilling out onto streets across America."" Gov. Tim Walz: ""I understand clearly there is no trust"" During a news conference Friday morning, the Minnesota governor acknowledged the pain of those outraged by Floyd's death in police custody — whose name he added to a list of ""unheard"" black men killed by police, including Philando Castile, who was shot in 2016 by police in a suburb of St. Paul. ""The very tools that we need to use to get control to make sure that buildings aren't burned and the rule of law doesn't collapse are those very institutional tools that have led to that grief and pain. I understand clearly there is no trust in many of our communities,"" Walz told reporters. ""But I'm asking you to help us use humane ways to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice, so that those that are expressing rage and anger and demanding justice are heard."" President Trump's tweet about ""THUGS"" flagged for glorifying violence The president, who called Floyd's death ""very sad and tragic"" earlier this week, said early Friday that he had told Minnesota's governor that ""the Military is with him all the way."" He also described the source of the unrest as ""THUGS"" — a word widely criticized for bearing racial overtones. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" he continued in a tweet partially hidden and flagged by Twitter for violating its policy against ""glorifying violence."" Trump did not miss the social network's decision. Not long after the move, the president — who signed an executive order Thursday aimed at limiting the legal protections afforded to social media companies such as Twitter — took aim at the company with a tweet saying it ""will be regulated."" Trump later sought to clarify his initial tweet, saying that shooting simply can occur when looting gets out of hand. ""It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,"" Trump explained in a pair of tweets. ""It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media."" In a tweet of his own, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said he is ""furious"" that Trump ""is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many."" Gov. Walz apologizes for brief arrest of CNN crew On Friday morning, state police arrested a CNN crew while it was reporting about the unrest on live television: ""A black reporter from CNN was arrested while legally covering the protests in Minneapolis,"" the network pointedly noted. ""A white reporter also on the ground was not."" The crew of correspondent Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez was released about an hour later, and Walz repeatedly apologized during his news conference Friday. ""A few minutes after hearing [about the arrest] I was on a call with CNN President Jeff Zucker, who demanded to know what happened. I take full responsibility,"" Walz said Friday. ""There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen. Calls were made immediately. This is a very public apology to that team. It should not happen."" The swift backtrack did little to soften the shock of the spectacle, though. ""With all the perversions of American democracy that we have witnessed, few rival the dystopian spectacle of a U.S. journalist calmly reporting the news and repeatedly offering to reposition his crew at the police's request, only to be arrested, cuffed and hauled away alongside his crew,"" said Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America, advocacy group that fights for press freedom. She added: ""For us at PEN America, where we routinely document the arrest and imprisonment of writers and journalists worldwide, the action was eerily familiar, but something we expect to see in authoritarian states: Turkey, Hong Kong, Egypt. To see it in the United States of America is appalling."" Obama and others nationwide respond to Floyd's death Demonstrators in Minneapolis are not alone in their outrage over Floyd's death. Activists spilled onto city streets across the country, holding protests seeking justice for the Minneapolis man as well as other unarmed black men and women who have died at the hands of law enforcement officers or in police custody. Large protests were held outside the White House and outside the CNN headquarters in Atlanta, as well as in cities including New York, Houston and San Jose, Calif. Among those who took to social media to express their pain and frustration Friday was former President Barack Obama. ""It's natural to wish for life 'to just get back to normal' as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly 'normal' – whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park,"" Obama said in a statement posted to social media. In speaking of jogging and bird-watching, the former president referred to two other videos that have inspired outrage this month — one in which a black man was followed and killed by two white men while out for a run in Georgia, and another in which a white woman called police on a black bird-watcher in New York City after he asked her to leash her dog. ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" Obama said. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" My statement on the death of George Floyd: pic.twitter.com/Hg1k9JHT6R — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 29, 2020 Protesters have turned out to express their outrage as far as Los Angeles and New York City. Meanwhile in Louisville, Ky., demonstrators gathered Thursday to protest death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot by police during a no-knock raid on her home in March. Those protests turned violent, as well, with several people reported shot amid the melee. As one protester in Minneapolis told NPR, the anger over Floyd's death is about more than just one man — it's about how police treat black people across the U.S. ""This is how our people react, you know? When we've been done wrong for so long,"" he said. ""So, me, I'm just praying and hoping everybody makes it home safe."" NPR's Adrian Florido contributed to this report. ",0.0

Read Obama's full statement below, including a reference to a viral video of a song by Keedron Bryant, who pleads, ""I just want to live, God protect me."" I want to share parts of the conversations I've had with friends over the past couple days about the footage of George Floyd dying face down on the street under the knee of a police officer in Minnesota. The first is an email from a middle-aged African American businessman. ""Dude I gotta tell you the George Floyd incident in Minnesota hurt. I cried when I saw that video. It broke me down. The 'knee on the neck' is a metaphor for how the system so cavalierly holds black folks down, ignoring the cries for help. People don't care. Truly tragic."" Another friend of mine used the powerful song that went viral from 12-year-old Keedron Bryant to describe the frustrations he was feeling. The circumstances of my friend and Keedron may be different, but their anguish is the same. It's shared by me and millions of others. It's natural to wish for life ""to just get back to normal"" as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly ""normal"" — whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park. This shouldn't be ""normal"" in 2020 America. It can't be ""normal."" If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better. It will fall mainly on the officials of Minnesota to ensure that the circumstances surrounding George Floyd's death are investigated thoroughly and that justice is ultimately done. But it falls on all of us, regardless of our race or station — including the majority of men and women in law enforcement who take pride in doing their tough job the right way, every day — to work together to create a ""new normal"" in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine held a news conference Friday to talk about Floyd’s death and the protests in downtown Columbus on Thursday night. “While Fran and I feel sorrow and disgust at what we saw, we cannot fully comprehend or imagine what an African American family must feel,” DeWine said. “His death impacts all of us. We have a responsibility to each other . . . regardless of race, to stand up and speak out and say ‘We won’t tolerate conduct like this.'” Floyd was restrained by officer Derek Chauvin, who dug his knee into Floyd’s neck. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with third degree murder and manslaughter. “This officer’s conduct violated every principle of human decency, but it also violated any kind of basic police training,” DeWine said. Peaceful protests in Columbus turned violent when some involved began throwing objects at police officers. Police responded by using tear gas to push the crowd back. The crowd let up, but an hour later the protest escalated when demonstrators smashed windows at the Ohio Statehouse while some went inside the building. “Protests expressing outrage are not only understandable, they are appropriate,” DeWine said. “Ohioans should speak out against wrongdoing. Ohioans should speak out for change . . . I ask my fellow Ohio citizens today as you gather in protest in the coming days throughout Ohio, regardless of the issue, please do so peacefully. We must not fight violence with more violence.” SWAT arrived on the scene soon after the Statehouse break-in. Officers used a loudspeaker to announce an emergency was declared in the area, meaning any protesters who refused to leave would be arrested. “The Columbus Police officers who responded to the Statehouse area yesterday put their own lives at risk and did an excellent job,” DeWine said. “The vast majority, almost all police officers do a good job. But we have a moral obligation to make sure every officer, all 35,000, have the proper training.” More of the damage left behind by tonight’s demonstrations downtown.

It is my sincere hope that the sheriff’s office will continue to play a meaningful role in building a bridge of trust, and promoting healing,” Franklin County Sheriff Dallas Baldwin released in a statement.

Many of the trash cans on the exterior were dumped and thrown. Some cans missing, lids missing, cans dented. The protest did not reach the level of escalation experienced in Minneapolis on Wednesday and Thursday, which included rioting, looting and fires set across the city including one inside the Minneapolis Police Department’s 3rd Precinct. Louisville protests also became violent. At least seven people were shot as protesters turned out to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March.

Governor DeWine reflected on Ohio’s police training and made this promise during his Friday press conference. “My committment today to citizens of Ohio is that we will do more,” DeWine said. “I will work with the leaders in the General Assembly, that I will work with Attorney General David Yost, and we will continue down this path and do more in this area.”",0.0

Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said state investigators arrested Derek Chauvin, who was one of four officers fired this week, but he did not provide details. The state attorney who would oversee any prosecution on state charges, whose home was also the site of protests, was scheduled to provide an update later Friday. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to this week’s protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state would take over the response to the protests and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district “on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen.” His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said. “You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted.

Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street, doing what they could to help. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention. “I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Walz publicly apologized on Friday. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing members of Floyd’s family, called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd’s body to have an independent autopsy performed. Floyd said that talk of a heart condition or asthma are irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner as well. Minutes after the precinct burned on Thursday, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” In a follow-up tweet, he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.” The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk” and said he was “not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd’s death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said that Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events that featured African-American music, Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press. Santamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, “he might have given him a little more mercy.” Santamaria, who sold the venue within the past two months, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but did not like to work the African American nights.

Your History. Your News.,http://www.afro.com,"By TIM SULLIVAN and AMY FORLITI, Associated Press MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The police officer seen on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in custody after pleading that he could not breathe, was arrested Friday after three days of often-violent protests that resulted in looting across parts of Minneapolis. Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said state investigators arrested Derek Chauvin, who was one of four officers fired this week, but he did not provide details. The state attorney who would oversee any prosecution on state charges, whose home was also the site of protests, was scheduled to provide an update later Friday. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to this week’s protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state would take over the response to the protests and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district “on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen.” His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said. “You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street, doing what they could to help. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents.

Word spread Friday on social media that protesters would gather downtown at 6 p.m. and would be out through the weekend. Police Commissioner Michael Harrison, who earlier Friday released a video condemning Floyd's treatment at the hands of Minneapolis officers, said police had contingency plans ready for the protests. ""This contingency includes small and large gatherings, short-term and long-term-demonstrations,"" Harrison said. ""The department is in constant contact with our state and local law enforcement partners, specifically the Maryland State Police."" Floyd died Monday after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, kneeled on his neck for at least seven minutes. Chauvin and three other officers were fired. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Through the state police, Harrison said, he could summon the National Guard if necessary. A number of guardsmen are already in Baltimore to assist in coronavirus testing and relief efforts. Harrison said a number of police officers have recently undergone retraining on how to deal with events like large protests. Mayor Bernard C. ""Jack"" Young said Floyd's killing and the subsequent protests and rioting in Minneapolis brought back difficult memories of the unrest that unfolded in Baltimore after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, who suffered fatal spinal injuries while in the back of a police van. ""It just sent chills through my body as a black man who could be mistaken, if I'm going somewhere in another city... it could happen to me,"" Young said.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Friday that he doesn’t think it is “fair” to compare protests in Minneapolis in the wake of George Floyd’s death to those that rocked Baltimore after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. Both deaths involved black men in police custody, with Floyd handcuffed and pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck, and Gray’s death being ruled a homicide after injuries to his spinal cord while being transported in a police van. “The evidence here seems overwhelming and clear to me and you have a video of exactly what happened,” Hogan told NBC, referring to footage of Floyd in Minneapolis. “However, the situation on the ground is reminiscent somewhat of the actions that took place afterwards.” “And I think back to 2015, I had just become governor of Maryland, I’d only been governor for for 90 days, and the worst violence in 47 years broke out in our largest city,” Hogan said.

Hogan said legitimate concerns and frustrations have to be addressed. “But burning down buildings and you know this violence and looting and burning police stations is not the answer.” Hogan also had words for President Donald Trump, who tweeted Friday that he would take action to bring the city of Minneapolis “under control,” calling violent protesters outraged by the death of a black man in police custody “thugs” and saying that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump’s tweet was flagged by Twitter for violating rules about “glorifying violence.” ….These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2020 “I do believe that you got to have law and order. We’ve got to stop the burning and looting but inciting violence with Twitter is not the way to go about it,” Hogan said. “Like I said, I walked the streets face-to-face and calmly talked with folks, but inciting things and inflammatory rhetoric isn’t going to help.” Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Thursday, Minneapolis released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk” and said he was “not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd’s death. Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest. In the Baltimore case of Freddie Gray, Gray was arrested on April 12, 2015, after police made eye contact with him and another man, both of whom ran. Officers put Gray in a police van, and he told officers several times that he needed medical care. He was taken to a police district station before an ambulance took him to a hospital in critical condition. Gray died at a hospital on April 19. Six days later, a peaceful protest in downtown Baltimore turned violent. Hours after Gray’s funeral on April 27, more unrest lasted into the night. More than 200 people were arrested. Massive protests over Gray’s death erupted in other major U.S. cities as well, including D.C., New York, Denver, Chicago, Minneapolis, Miami, Philadelphia, Portland and Seattle. Six Baltimore police officers were charged in Gray’s death. Three were acquitted and then-Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby dropped the remaining cases.

The group, which gathered along the Inner Harbor around 7 p.m., blocked traffic along Light Street. Some held signs and others chanted before the group splintered. Some went to City Hall to continue to protest. Group and police now at City Hall. @wjz pic.twitter.com/obWJNeidml — Avajoye Burnett (@AvajoyeWJZ) May 30, 2020 Police said early Friday they had a contingency plan should their be protests in Baltimore. Officers on bikes and on foot, as well as in vehicles, monitored the crowd. Some officers tried to redirect traffic. Related Coverage: Protests continued around the country for Floyd, including in Washington D.C., where Secret Service and Metropolitan Police responded near the White House where a large crowd gathered Friday night. For the fourth night in a row, protestors gather in Minneapolis where officials implemented an 8 p.m. curfew. Last night, a police precinct was set on fire, along with several other buildings. In Atlanta, demonstrators got violent outside the CNN Center, breaking glass and throwing objects at officer. Other protests are happening in New York and Los Angeles. Police initially said Floyd was resisting arrest and had a medical incident. However, video obtained by CBS News shows Floyd cooperating with officers, at least in the initial moments of the encounter. A bystander’s video showed Floyd pleading that he could not breathe as a white officer — identified as Derek Chauvin — knelt on his neck and kept his knee there for several minutes after Floyd stopped moving and became unresponsive. A group has gathered and is marching in downtown Baltimore to protest the death of George Floyd, who was killed after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin used his knee on Floyd’s neck to pin him down during an arrest. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with murder in Floyd’s fatal arrest. Maryland leaders condemned the deadly arrest Friday during various press conferences. “The killing of George Floyd at the hands of law enforcement is both deeply horrific and heartbreaking. What we saw in the video was disgusting and shocking to the conscience,” Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said. “This does not represent the calling of our officers to serve and protect with dignity and respect.” Anne Arundel County’s Police Chief also commented in a press conference, where he was joined by leaders of Maryland’s African American community. “Every right-thinking police officer in this country was disgusted by what they saw on that video. Human life matters. We exist to protect it.” he said. He urged people to protest peacefully and they will be there to protect them. Baltimore police said they have a plan in case protests break out in Baltimore. Watch for coverage from WCCO, CBS Minnesota.",0.0

Credit: KEREM YUCEL/AFP via Getty Images MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The white Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd’s neck was arrested on murder charges Friday and accused in court papers of ignoring another officer’s concerns about the handcuffed black man who died after pleading that he could not breathe. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the case, which sparked protests across the United States and fires and looting in Minneapolis. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest, but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wanted all the officers arrested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said more charges were possible. He said the investigation into three other officers who were at the scene continues, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Chauvin allegedly disregarded the worries of the other officer, who wanted to roll Floyd onto his side, according to the criminal complaint. The papers also said that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. The exam concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death, according to the complaint. Floyd’s family was seeking an independent autopsy. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic. Chauvin and officer Tou Thoa arrived to help and tried several times to get Floyd into the car, but he struggled, the complaint said. At one point, Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the passenger side of the car, and Floyd, who was handcuffed, went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and officer Thomas Lane held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. Lane asked, “Should we roll him on his side?” Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever,” and Chauvin said, “That’s why we have him on his stomach,” according to the complaint. After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said that he wanted to roll Chauvin onto his side. Kueng checked for a wrist pulse and said he could not find one, the complaint said. In all, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, according to the complaint. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. Freeman, whose home was also picketed by protesters, highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd’s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. All four officers who were at the scene of Floyd’s death on Monday were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside the government center chanted, “All four got to go.” It was not immediately clear whether Chauvin’s arrest would quiet the unrest, which escalated Thursday as demonstrators torched a Minneapolis police station that officers had abandoned. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state has taken over the response to the violence and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Trump later clarified that he was referring to shooting that had happened during the protests. The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said. “You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention. “I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey took responsibility for evacuating the police precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, said Chauvin’s arrest was “a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice.” Crump had earlier called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd’s body to have an independent autopsy performed. Crump said that talk of a heart condition or asthma is irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner as well. State and federal authorities are also investigating Floyd’s death. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said that Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events that featured African American music, Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press. Full Coverage: Minneapolis Santamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, “he might have given him a little more mercy.” Santamaria, who sold the venue within the past two months, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified “overkill.” ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison and Bernard Condon in New York contributed to this report.",0.0

Your History. Your News.,http://www.afro.com,"Protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody spread around the United States on Friday, as his case renewed anger over others involving African Americans, police, and race relations. Protests were largely peaceful as demonstrators marched in the streets from Los Angeles to New York, but in Atlanta, demonstrators set a police car ablaze and broke windows at CNN’s headquarters. Here is a look at some protests across the country: ___ ATLANTA — Protesters set a police car on fire, struck officers with bottles, vandalized the headquarters of CNN, and broke into a restaurant in downtown Atlanta as a demonstration that started peacefully quickly changed tone Friday evening. Protesters used barricades to break police vehicle windshields and jumped from car to car. Hundreds of the protesters confronted police outside CNN headquarters. They spray-painted the large, iconic CNN logo outside the building, breaking a windowed entrance. One protester climbed on top of the sign and waved a “Black Lives Matter” flag to cheers from the crowd. Protesters pelted officers who came over with bottles, striking some of them. Other bottles thrown at authorities exploded behind the police line, but no officers appeared to get hit. Protesters chanted, “Quit your jobs.” The officers backed their line away from the group of protesters who were throwing objects at them. Police ordered demonstrators to leave the street and threatened to arrest them if they did not leave quickly. Protesters used accelerant to burn an American flag. People were watching the scene from rooftops, some laughing at skirmishes that broke out and vandalism by the protesters. Protesters were also walking on the interstate in downtown Atlanta and appeared to be trying to block traffic. The Georgia State Patrol has responded. Earlier, as the protest appeared more calm, Kaity Brackett, 27, said she came out to the protest because she thinks the entire criminal justice system needs to be overhauled, starting with policing. She said the Ahmaud Arbery killing was a catalyst for her and referred to his death as a lynching. Arbery was killed on Feb. 23 by a former district attorney investigator and his son, who were not arrested until after video emerged months later. Brackett wore a blue mask and sat with her partner and a friend. She was less concerned about the threat from the coronavirus. “We risk our lives going to the grocery store, going to get gas,” she said. “This is more important than all of that.” ___ DENVER — Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called for calm and unity Friday after the first of several planned city protests over George Floyd’s death turned violent, declaring, “Let not the story be about the riots and protests. Let’s keep the focus on the life that was lost.” “I can tell you not to go out and demonstrate but the reality is it’s going to happen,” Hancock said at a news briefing, stressing he shared outrage over what he’s called the “senseless and tragic murder” of Floyd in Minneapolis. Hancock and Police Chief Paul Pazen blamed what they called a minority of agitators among peaceful protesters for inciting violence throughout downtown on Thursday. That violence included throwing rocks at police officers, setting small fires, and breaking windows and damaging cars at the state Capitol and at businesses. More protests were planned for Friday and Saturday. Pazen said three officers were injured and that 13 people were arrested for burglary, criminal mischief and assault. ___ NEW YORK — Demonstrators took to New York City streets on Friday for a second day in protest of the death of George Floyd, the black Minnesota man killed in police custody, and invoked the names of other black people who died at police hands. In Brooklyn, crowds of demonstrators chanted at police officers lined up outside the Barclays Center. There were several moments of struggle, as some in the crowd pushed against metal barricades and police pushed back. Scores of water bottles flew from the crowd toward the officers, and in return police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical at the group twice. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. Protests have taken place around the country, with some in Minnesota and elsewhere becoming violent. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, most wearing masks, where the demonstrations started Friday. The protest took place despite coronavirus prohibitions on large gatherings. The demonstrators were gathered in the square, while police stood across the street. “Our country has a sickness,” Petrisko said. “We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” At his Friday briefing, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he stood with the Minnesota protesters. “Nobody is sanctioning the arson, and the thuggery and the burglaries, but the protesters and the anger and the fear and the frustration? Yes. Yes. And the demand is for justice,” Cuomo said. At a news conference, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said New York Police Department officers had been told to respect peaceful protest. He also had a message for protesters. “If you are angry with the government, if you are angry with the elected leaders, direct that anger to all of us, because if we haven’t done enough, we are the ones who should be held responsible,” he said. “But the police officer in front of you is a working man or woman just trying to do their job.” ___ WINDERMERE, Fla. — A group of about 10 protesters gathered Friday near a Florida town home that belongs to a white Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd’s neck. The protesters arrived after social media postings listed the address of Derek Chauvin in the community of Windermere outside Orlando. They carried signs that said, “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George,” and “We see you, we hear you … we love you! #Justice for George.” The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as Chauvin, the white police officer, knelt on his neck during an arrest recorded on video by bystanders. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office tweeted from its official account that Chauvin is not at the residence and is not expected there. The office says it’s confirmed he has no plans to be in the area. ___ ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Albuquerque police used a helicopter and tear gas as they retreated from a crowd of people after a confrontation that followed a protest of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Police said officers responded to several shots being fired from a vehicle following a demonstration that had lasted hours. Four individuals were taken into custody, and several protesters became confrontational, police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos said. During the confrontation, protesters waved signs and yelled at officers clad in riot gear. Gallegos said Friday the tear gas was used to allow officers to leave the area and avoid further confrontation. There were no reports of injuries from the gunshots, and it wasn’t clear whether that incident was related to the protest. Gallegos also said there were no injuries resulting from the confrontation with protesters. ___ FONTANA, Calif. — Nine people were arrested after rocks were thrown at businesses, vehicles and officers during a Southern California protest stemming from the death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody. The violence erupted Thursday night in Fontana as about 100 people moved up and down a thoroughfare and blocked traffic. Police say an unlawful assembly was declared and the crowd was ordered to disperse but some persisted. Elsewhere in the region, demonstrators gathered outside Los Angeles police headquarters but there was no repeat of Wednesday evening’s action in which protesters blocked freeway traffic and attacked two Highway Patrol cruisers. Fontana is an inland city about 50 miles (80) kilometers east of Los Angeles. ___ COLUMBUS, Ohio — Protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody turned out for a demonstration in Columbus that began peacefully but turned violent, with windows smashed at the Ohio Statehouse and storefronts along surrounding downtown streets. The crowd of about 400 people entered into a standoff with Columbus police Thursday night, blocking the intersection of key streets in the Ohio capital for hours, the Columbus Dispatch reported. The demonstration began as a peaceful protest, but news outlets reported protesters began throwing objects like water bottles at officers, who responded by using tear gas on the crowd. A scuffle between a protester and an officer broke out around 9:45 p.m., WCMH-TV reported. Videos obtained by The Associated Press show people smashing the building’s windows. One person briefly entered an office through a broken window but retreated before troopers within the building could catch him, said Ohio State Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Craig Cvetan. Windows were boarded up early Friday and workers were placing plywood over undamaged windows out of precaution. ___ HOUSTON — On Friday, several thousand people attended a rally in front of city hall in Houston, where George Floyd grew up. The rally was mostly peaceful but police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd. The crowed marched through downtown Houston to get to city hall, blocking traffic and at times chanting “No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” Many held up signs that said, “I Can’t Breathe” and “Justice For George.” Eventually the protesters ended up alongside U.S. Highway 59, one of the major thoroughfares in Houston. A group of about 60 to 70 shut down the freeway for at least half an hour. Houston police accompanied the protesters as they marched for less than half a mile along the freeway before they walked off of it. No arrests were made. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said he welcomed the rally. “We stand with them protesting what happened in Minnesota,” said Acevedo. “I’m happy that they’re here today because people need to be heard, voices need to be heard.” One of those protesting Floyd’s death was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” ___ PHOENIX — Hundreds rallied in downtown Phoenix to demonstrate against the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in a protest that turned into a clash with police. Protesters who marched from Phoenix City Hall to the state Capitol on Thursday night into Friday morning carried signs reading, “Silence is violence” and “Being black should not be a death sentence,” The Arizona Republic reported. Around 11 p.m., Phoenix police declared an unlawful assembly around the Capitol building. Protesters refused to leave the area, news outlets reported. The newspaper reported that rocks and water bottles were thrown at police. Video from local TV stations shows protesters hammering on the window of a police car, and the newspaper reported at least one police car window was broken. The Arizona Department of Public Safety and Phoenix police responded by firing pepper spray and rubber bullets at the crowd. ___ PETAL, Miss. — A Mississippi mayor who sparked outrage when he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable” about the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody is resisting calls to resign, including from his own town’s board of aldermen. “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” Petal Mayor Hal Marx tweeted Tuesday, the day four Minneapolis police officers were fired. The 46-year-old Floyd, a black man, was handcuffed and pleading for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck Monday. In a follow-up tweet, the Republican directly referenced the Floyd case, saying he “didn’t see anything unreasonable”: “If you can say you can’t breathe, you’re breathing. Most likely that man died of overdose or heart attack. Video doesn’t show his resistance that got him in that position. Police being crucified.” ___ LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Looking to defuse tensions in Louisville over the fatal shooting of a black woman by police who broke down her door, the victim’s mother on Friday called on protesters to continue demanding justice but to do it in “the right way without hurting each other.” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor’s mother hours after gunshots erupted, wounding at least seven people, during protests late Thursday outside City Hall. At least one person was in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police said early Friday. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” and all seven shot were civilians, police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. In her statement, Tamika Palmer said her daughter — an emergency medical technician — devoted her life to others, and the “last thing she’d want right now is any more violence.” Thursday night’s demonstration came as protesters across the country, in cities including Los Angeles, Denver, New York and Memphis, turned out in alliance with demonstrators in Minneapolis, where George Floyd became the latest black man to die in police custody. ___ SAN JOSE, Calif. — Roughly 300 people protesting the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis policeman have shut down a five-lane section of a highway in California’s Silicon Valley. Vehicles southbound on U.S. 101 were at a virtual standstill Friday afternoon, ahead of a greatly diminished rush hour as the region shelters at home. KGO-TV footage shows some cars passing on a shoulder of U.S. 101 in San Jose. Some protesters are wearing masks and some are not. Later in the afternoon, the protesters were leaving the highway. ___ LAS VEGAS — More than 400 people were demonstrating on the Las Vegas Strip Friday afternoon calling for policing reforms after black man was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer. The crowd gathered in triple-digit-heat in front of the Bellagio casino-resort, holding signs and chanting “No justice, no peace!” and “Black lives matter.” They later began walking north up the Las Vegas Strip in front of casinos still shuttered because of coronavirus-related closures. The demonstration was in memory of George Floyd, who died late Monday. Bystander video showed a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on his neck.",0.0

Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said he has been in touch with police chiefs around the country and with Maryland State Police to plan for demonstrations that might occur.After the 2015 riots following the police in-custody death of Freddie Gray, Baltimore has some experience with what has been happening in Minneapolis this week.Mayor Jack Young implored any protesters to be peaceful.""I just don't want to see what's happening in Minneapolis to happen here in Baltimore. I know protesters are going from city to city, but if they come to Baltimore peacefully without committing any rioting or burning down stores, things of nature, everybody have a right to protest,"" Young said.Harrison said the department did some special training in March as part of the coronavirus response out of concern of any kind of crowd control if there was a food shortage.“We are prepared for it.

She claimed to be mentally ill and couldn't go home to her family.Ward was told the woman was not with protesters who gathered downtown in wake of the death of George Floyd. She remained after they cleared at 9 p.m. and the encounter with police happened before the demonstration returned an hour later.Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said Saturday afternoon that the officer is on administrative duty.""I saw a video regarding an altercation between a woman and members of the Baltimore Police Department. I saw that video and I saw what transpired in that video. I ordered an immediate investigation into that incident,"" Harrison said. ""The officer has been removed from his assignment and (is) on administrative duties until the outcome of that investigation. So we wanted to make sure that we did swift and decisive action to make sure that we are not just accountable, but transparent during this time.""Harrison said there are two investigations underway, first, what was seen in the video, and, second, the woman's individual case. She was taken to a hospital and is facing charges. Her name or charges weren't released. Earlier Saturday, the Police Department released a statement, saying: ""Last night, the department became aware of an incident involving the arrest of a woman by two of our officers.

I've also asked Commissioner Harrison to relay a simple message to his command staff and to officers from across the city: sound, constitutional policing is the only acceptable way we're going to do things here in Baltimore under my watch. ""I believe the first officer, who was struck multiple times by the woman, showed remarkable restraint by not retaliating as he was being assaulted. The woman should have been placed under arrest and not assaulted. Our system of justice does not involve the concept of an 'eye for an eye.'""The level of violence on our streets remains consistently high and we need to continue to stay focused on driving down violent crime and preserving life.""We're working to build the best police department in the country and we don't have room for error.""City Council President Brandon Scott addressed the situation in a series of tweets, saying: ""Just got home from the protest downtown.

Credit: ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images The latest: - The Minneapolis officer who was seen on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd has been arrested and charged with murder. - Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey declared a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. Protesters defied that order, though, swarming streets. - Demonstrators marched, stopped traffic and in some cases lashed out violently at police as protests erupted Friday in dozens of U.S. cities. - The Pentagon took the rare step of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Protesters nationwide have demanded justice for George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died this week after a white police officer used his knee to pin him down in an incident captured on video. Protesters smashed windows at CNN's headquarters in Atlanta, torched a police car and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to fatal shootings. The white Minneapolis police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged Friday, and authorities imposed an overnight curfew to try to stem three nights of often-violent protests that left dozens of stores burned and looted.   Former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the case. He was also accused of ignoring another officer at the scene who expressed concerns about the black man as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a small grocery store. Military police put on alert As unrest spread across dozens of American cities on Friday, the Pentagon took the rare step of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis. Soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders. Soldiers in Fort Carson, in Colorado, and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. The people did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The get-ready orders were sent verbally on Friday, after President Donald Trump asked Defense Secretary Mark Esper for military options to help quell the unrest in Minneapolis after protests descended into looting and arson in some parts of the city. Trump made the request on a phone call from the Oval Office on Thursday night that included Esper, National Security Advisor Robert O’ Brien and several others. The president asked Esper for rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to one of the people, senior Pentagon official who was on the call. ”When the White House asks for options, someone opens the drawer and pulls them out so to speak.” the official said. The person said the military units would be deployed under the Insurrection Act of 1807, which was last used in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial. “If this is where the president is headed response-wise, it would represent a significant escalation and a determination that the various state and local authorities are not up to the task of responding to the growing unrest,"" Brad Moss, a Washington D.C.-based attorney, who specializes in national security. Members of the police units were on a 30-minute recall alert early Saturday, meaning they would have to return to their bases inside that time limit in preparation for deployment to Minneapolis inside of four hours. Units at Fort Drum are slated to head to Minneapolis first, according to the three people, including two Defense Department officials. Roughly 800 U.S. soldiers would deploy to the city if called. Protesters brazenly resist curfew In Minneapolis, thousands of protesters marched through downtown as an 8 p.m. curfew ticked past. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” The curfew didn't stop protesters and others from gathering in several areas of the city, including the battered Lake Street neighborhood where a police precinct was burned the night before. There were scattered small fires and some stores in a strip mall were being broken into near the city’s 5th Precinct. Elsewhere in the city, officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to drive back crowds of protesters. Chauvin's arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he expected swift justice in the death of Floyd, whose death sparked protests nationwide. Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington announced Chauvin's arrest following the governor's news conference Friday. The arrest comes after three days of protests, which escalated in violence as demonstrators torched a police precinct that had been abandoned by officers. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Friday acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to this week’s violent protests. Walz said the state would take over the response and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. Peaceful, violent protests occur throughout US Protests also took place in at least 25 other cities, including Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and New Orleans. Georgia’s governor declared a state of emergency early Saturday to activate the state National Guard as violence flared in Atlanta. The Guard was also on standby in the District of Columbia, where a crowd grew outside the White House and chanted curses at President Donald Trump. Some protesters tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue, and threw bottles and other objects at officers wearing riot gear, who responded with pepper spray. In Oakland, California, police said two Federal Protective Service officers were shot during protests Friday night. One of the officers died from his injury. At least 7,500 protesters took to the streets of the city to demonstrate over the death of George Floyd, the Oakland Police Department told CNN. While arrests were made, police were unable to provide specifics and are still investigating. The Federal Protective Service, which falls under the Department of Homeland Security, provides security and law enforcement services at U.S. government facilities. In Portland, Oregon, police reported three shootings involving two victims, one of which involved a man having a gunshot wound in the chest. A fire burned in a downtown street and video appeared to show dozens of people taking bags from a Louis Vuitton store inside Pioneer Place mall. Police, who declared the protest a riot, said they deployed gas after people threw projectiles at them. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted a plea to protesters to remain peaceful and said that, while he had left Portland to attend to his dying mother, he was heading back. “Portland, this is not us,” he wrote. “When you destroy our city, you are destroying our community. When you act in violence against each other, you are hurting all of us. How does this honor the legacy of George Floyd?” An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to take away prisoners. One person was killed in downtown Detroit after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters, a Detroit police spokeswoman said Saturday. The shooting occurred about 11:30 p.m. Friday near Detroit's Greektown entertainment district as officers were confronted with dozens of protesters, said Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood, a police department spokeswoman. She said an officer wasn't involved in the shooting. Kirkwood said the victim was a 19-year-old man, who was pronounced dead at the hospital. The suspect pulled up in a Dodge Durango and fired shots into the crowd, she said. In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd. Jimmy Ohaz, 19, came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” Houston police tweeted early Saturday that nearly 200 arrests were made and four officers were injured during the protests. Attorneys seek outside probe of Floyd's death Attorneys for the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor are calling for an independent investigation of the actions leading to Floyd’s death. They also want national reforms in response to the three deaths. Documents said that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. The exam concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. Attorney Ben Crump said during a news conference Friday that he's asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. He and attorney Lee Merritt said they want murder charges brought against the four Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd's arrest. And they want the Minnesota attorney general to take over the investigation. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and officer Tou Thoa arrived to help and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car, the complaint said. At one point, Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the car's passenger side, and Floyd, who was handcuffed, went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd's back, and officer Thomas Lane held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him."" Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever,"" and Chauvin replied, “That's why we have him on his stomach,"" according to the complaint. Crump says the families from Georgia, Kentucky and now Minnesota have all had to dispel narratives from law enforcement that their loved ones “brought this upon themselves.” They cited an initial report in Floyd’s case that said he threatened police and died of a medical condition. Videos show an officer kneeling on the back of Floyd’s neck as the handcuffed black man pleads for air. The attorneys said they'll seek national legislation seeking better training and to lower the burden to charge officers for excessive force. Twitter adds warning label to Trump tweet for 'glorifying violence' Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. Twitter said the president violated its rule against glorifying violence and later affixed a warning label to the tweet — the first time such action has been taken against the president's account. The social media platform is using what it calls a ""public interest notice"" to flag the post. Trump responded Friday morning with a tweet saying Twitter has ""targeted Republicans, Conservatives & the President of the United States."" Twitter has said in the past that it makes exceptions to its rules when heads of state are involved, due to the inherently newsworthy nature of their posts. The company's flagging of Trump's post came hours after the president signed an executive order Thursday that purported to address ""censorship"" by Twitter and other social media companies. He was perturbed by Twitter's decision to affix fact-check type labels to two of his misleading posts about mail-in voting ballots. Investigation ahead The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. CNN contributed to this report.",0.0

1621095596,2020-05-30 15:01:53,George Floyd Death: Protesters Gather In Baltimore For Second Consecutive Day,https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2020/05/30/george-floyd-death-protests-baltimore-saturday-latest/,en,False,,21216,baltimore.cbslocal.com,http://baltimore.cbslocal.com,"  A large crowd gathered outside Baltimore’s City Hall Saturday night to protest the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis earlier this week. Although the protest remained mostly peaceful for the second night in a row, some demonstrators got violent. Video also captured a bottle being thrown in the direction of police outside City Hall, and a Baltimore Police car that had its rear windshield and rear passenger window smashed out earlier in the day. WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren reported that police arrived in riot gear around 9:30 p.m. after people set off fireworks outside City Hall and were seen standing on top of city-owned vans that were spray-painted with graffiti.

Baltimore Police were actively monitoring the protest activity in the downtown area near City Hall where nearly three dozen remained late Saturday. An order to disperse and stop criminal and destructive activity was given, the department said, however, Baltimore does not have a curfew and it is not illegal for the protesters to gather. Baltimore Police also said the department has coordinated with Maryland State Police to activate additional resources to aid in order to keep the city safe.

Members of MSP will be transported via Humvees and are due to arrive shortly. — Baltimore Police (@BaltimorePolice) May 31, 2020 During a press conference Saturday, Mayor Jack Young urged people to protest peacefully. “We will protect your right for peaceful protests,” Young said. “But I have zero tolerance for anything that approaches chaos and law-breaking.” “I can’t have our city turned to chaos,” Mayor Young added. “We will not let outside influencers come into the City of Baltimore and create chaos.” Earlier in the day, dozens of vehicles took part in a car caravan protest, which began in the city’s Station North neighborhood. Some stood holding signs reading “No justice, no peace, no racist police” and #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd.” “We have said over the years, over and over, we want this to stop, and no one has listened,” a protester told WJZ. “Now, they can’t help but listen.” The group marched down North Avenue to Penn North at the beginning of the protest. The group later moved to outside City Hall where protesters chanted “I can’t breathe.” The scene outside Baltimore City Hall where protesters are chanting “I can’t breathe”—police were just instructed to turn on their body-worn cameras @wjz pic.twitter.com/sEadJY3Ngu — Mike Hellgren (@HellgrenWJZ) May 30, 2020 Mayor Young said on Twitter Saturday night that the protests in Baltimore were largely peaceful, but that, “We’ve seen a few agitators taking advantage of peaceful protesters.” Members of @BaltimorePolice are out and will maintain order on our streets. We've seen a few agitators taking advantage of peaceful protesters. — Mayor Bernard C. Jack Young (@mayorbcyoung) May 31, 2020 “If you are currently out on the streets of Baltimore, please go home!” the mayor said as the protests continued late into the night. Baltimore isn’t the only city where protesters gathered. Demonstrations continued around the country Saturday, including in Philadelphia, where protesters vandalized and tried to set fire to the controversial statue of former mayor and police commissioner Frank Rizzo. Outside the White House, protesters gathered for the second straight day. At Lafayette Park, across from the White House, three lines of barricades separated protesters from a line of police officers in riot gear. Protests were also reported in Los Angeles, Dallas, New York and other major cities. On Friday night, a group of protesters gathered near the Inner Harbor before moving to City Hall. They blocked traffic along Light Street and remained peaceful. Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said the department is helping citizens exercise their First Amendment rights. He added that they are in a constant state of planning and in contact with Maryland State Police.

1621097871,2020-05-30 14:47:00,Minnesota To Deploy Record Guard Force To Contain Unrest Over Death Of George Floyd,https://www.wypr.org/post/minnesota-deploy-record-guard-force-contain-unrest-over-death-george-floyd,en,False,,245165,wypr.org,http://wypr.org/,"Updated at 4:41 p.m. ET Faced with a fourth straight night of massive protests over the death of George Floyd, Minnesota on Friday deployed its largest law enforcement operation in state history, including more than 700 members of the National Guard. ""It was not enough,"" Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — ""an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,"" according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. ""We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,"" the governor said Saturday. ""But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life."" The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd's death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order ""to help keep peace in Louisville."" ""I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,"" Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. ""But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe."" President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd's memory is for authorities to ""get tougher"" on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called ""radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can't do this."" ""They've got to be tough, they've got to be smart,"" Trump said of state officials. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military."" In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump's comments, saying that though the outrage is ""real and legitimate,"" the protests are ""being hijacked by violent radical elements."" ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,"" Barr said. ""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence."" NPR's Tom Bowman contributed to this report. ",0.0

(AP) — Maryland lawmakers on Saturday announced a group of legislators to address issues concerning police accountability. The interim workgroup will start meeting this summer and make recommendations for next year’s legislative session. “Policing in America is broken. While we have taken a number of positive steps in Maryland, we can’t be satisfied until every citizen has confidence in their police department,” said House Speaker Adrienne Jones, who is the first black and female House speaker in Maryland. “As the mother of two sons, accountability in policing is not just philosophical, it is personal.” Del. Luke Clippinger, a Baltimore Democrat who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said Maryland has done important work on the issue in the last several years, but it’s not enough. “We are seeing record levels of crime in Baltimore City, at the same time that the Baltimore Police Department is under a federal consent decree,” Clippinger said. “I am hoping to see recommendations for tangible reform that restores trust and helps communities build real relationships with the law enforcement that serve them.” Baltimore entered into its consent decree after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray following an injury while in police custody, which caused unrest in the city five years ago. A measure to improve disclosure of police records passed Clippinger’s committee in the last session, but lawmakers adjourned early due to the coronavirus before the bill could advance further. Del. Vanessa Atterbeary, a Prince George’s County Democrat, will chair the workgroup. “The events around the country this week have underscored that we cannot wait another day,” Atterbeary said. “We need structural reform ideas from the community and law enforcement to fix this problem in a collaborative way.” Protests have been taken place in cities around the country following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd, an African American, died after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The officer was fired from the department and faces criminal charges. The Maryland panel will review policies and procedures related to the investigations of police misconduct. It also will examine the viability of uniform statewide use of force policies and arrest procedures and review the use of body cameras and the disclosure of camera footage. It also will identify national best practices of independent prosecution of law-enforcement related crimes. Maryland’s Commission to Restore Trust in Policing is set to complete its work at the end of the year after focusing for two years on reforms to the Baltimore City Police Department after a specialized gun-recovery unit made up of rogue detectives was brought down in a far-reaching federal investigation.

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) during a campaign event on March 2, 2020 in Dallas, Texas. Klobuchar has suspended her campaign and endorsed Biden before the upcoming Super Tuesday Democratic presidential primaries. (Photo by Ron Jenkins/Getty Images) Advertisement Biden ally sees Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate Share Shares Copy Link Copy Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said Friday. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters that while he believes Klobuchar is “absolutely” qualified to be vice president, “This is very tough timing for her.” Klobuchar, D-Minn., was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. As she was leaving the post to join the Senate, an officer involved in this week’s death of George Floyd was involved in the death of another man. The officer ultimately was not prosecuted. Clyburn, who said his view was his “gut feeling,” played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the party’s all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress’ highest-ranking black lawmaker.Related: NY protesters demand justice for George Floyd“So often in politics, timing really dictates things, Barack Obama I don’t think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. “And I don’t know whether he could get elected today.”On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota have “nothing to do with my running mate.” Pressed on whether Floyd’s killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. “And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Clyburn helped revive Biden’s badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive triumph in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party’s presumptive nominee. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, was prosecutor of Minnesota's largest county, which includes Minneapolis. While Klobuchar was in that job, more than two dozen citizens died during encounters with police but none of the officers involved were criminally charged. Most victims were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of the past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breath as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. The case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar had been elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney’s office. Klobuchar did not respond to a request by The Associated Press for an interview on Friday. But she told NBC news that reports stating she had declined the case involving Chauvin years ago were “absolutely false.”Klobuchar told the network that during the years she led the office, it was the practice to present police shooting cases to a grand jury to consider charges. She said she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote a letter Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate “patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing” by the Minneapolis police. ___AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

While we have taken a number of positive steps in Maryland, we can't be satisfied until every citizen has confidence in their police department,"" said House Speaker Adrienne Jones, who is the first black and female House speaker in Maryland. ""As the mother of two sons, accountability in policing is not just philosophical, it is personal.""Delegate Luke Clippinger, a Baltimore Democrat who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said Maryland has done important work on the issue in the last several years, but it's not enough.""We are seeing record levels of crime in Baltimore City, at the same time that the Baltimore Police Department is under a federal consent decree,"" Clippinger said. ""I am hoping to see recommendations for tangible reform that restores trust and helps communities build real relationships with the law enforcement that serve them.""Baltimore entered into its consent decree after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray following an injury while in police custody, which caused unrest in the city five years ago.A measure to improve disclosure of police records passed Clippinger's committee in the last session, but lawmakers adjourned early due to the coronavirus before the bill could advance further.Delegate Vanessa Atterbeary, a Prince George's County Democrat, will chair the workgroup.""The events around the country this week have underscored that we cannot wait another day,"" Atterbeary said. ""We need structural reform ideas from the community and law enforcement to fix this problem in a collaborative way.""Protests have been taken place in cities around the country following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd, an African American, died after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The officer was fired from the department and faces criminal charges.The Maryland panel will review policies and procedures related to the investigations of police misconduct. It also will examine the viability of uniform statewide use of force policies and arrest procedures and review the use of body cameras and the disclosure of camera footage. It also will identify national best practices of independent prosecution of law-enforcement related crimes.Maryland's Commission to Restore Trust in Policing is set to complete its work at the end of the year after focusing for two years on reforms to the Baltimore City Police Department after a specialized gun-recovery unit made up of rogue detectives was brought down in a far-reaching federal investigation.",0.0

1621209818,2020-05-30 20:20:00,George Floyd Death: Protesters Converge On White House For Second Straight Day,https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2020/05/30/protesters-converge-on-white-house-for-second-straight-day/,en,True,,21216,baltimore.cbslocal.com,http://baltimore.cbslocal.com,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Shouting “Black Lives Matter” and “I can’t breathe,” hundreds of people converged on the White House for a second straight day Saturday to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump’s response. Trump, who earlier belittled the protesters, pledged to “stop mob violence.” “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,” the president said in Florida after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. “Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos are the missions at hand.” At Lafayette Park, across from the White House, three lines of barricades separated protesters from a line of police officers in riot gear. Speaking over a megaphone, Cameron McCall said, “We don’t need violence. All we need are our voices.” While some protesters stayed near the White House, others marched through the streets chanting, “No justice and no peace.” and “Say his name: George Floyd.” The mood was angry but decidedly non-violent with several speakers imploring marchers to remain peaceful. Earlier, though, there were skirmishes between protesters and Secret Service officers on the edge of Lafayette Square, according to a reporter for radio station WTOP. Pepper spray was used to disperse one group of protesters, the station reported. At multiple stops along the march, protesters openly taunted and verbally abused lines of uniformed police officers with riot shields. The march paused between the the Washington Monument and the African-American Museum and demonstrators sat down in the street for a nine-minute moment of silence for the nine minutes that the Minneapolis police officer knelt on George Floyd’s neck. . At the Lincoln Memorial, one organizer spoke over a megaphone “Look to the left and to the right and thank that person. We can’t hug anybody because of COVID but I love you anyway.” Many of the protesters wore masks, but did not socially distance themselves. Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. In a series of tweets earlier Saturday, Trump doubted their allegiance to Floyd’s memory, saying they were “professionally managed.” He offered no evidence to back his assertion, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: “Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” Trump later rejected the suggestion that he was stoking a potential conflict between protesters and his supporters. “I was just asking. But I have no idea if they are going to be here,” he said. “MAGA is Make America Great Again. By the way, they love African American people. They love black people.” At Saturday’s demonstration, there was no evidence of a counter-move by Trump supporters. Trump said he had “watched every move” from inside the executive mansion during Friday’s protest and “couldn’t have felt more safe” as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, “but whenever someone … got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard — didn’t know what hit them.” The president also criticized the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. Trump said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “is probably a very good person, but he’s a radical, left mayor.” He then described how he watched as a police station in the city was overrun. “For that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I’ve never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life,” Trump said when speaking briefly to reporters at the White House. He said Minnesota officials have to get tougher with rioters, and that by doing so they would be honoring the memory of Floyd. The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested in Washington and “multiple” officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Saturday called the protesters “criminals” who committed “acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.” Wolf said the Secret Service was “evolving and adapting to the changing nature of the threats they face.” Floyd is the black man who was being held in handcuffs when he died Monday in Minneapolis after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Protests have erupted in U.S. cities in the days since. As he tweeted, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were “just waiting for action” and ready to unleash “the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” His reference to “vicious dogs” potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation’s capital, called Trump’s remark’s “gross” and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation’s fight against segregation. “I call upon our city and our nation to exercise restraint, great restraint, even as the president tries to divide us,” she said. “I feel like these comments are an attack on humanity, an attack on black America, and they make my city less safe.” In contrast with the president’s tweets, the Secret Service said it “respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.” In protests that stretched into the early hours Saturday, people hurled pieces of bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and Park Police officers who were in riot gear behind barricades around the White House. Protesters at times kicked and punched officers and wrestled over the barricades. As some in the crowd grew more aggressive, police deployed pepper spray to keep them back and maintain a perimeter of officers around the White House. The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering “unlawful” and ordered everyone to leave Lafayette Square, a seven-acre public park located directly north of the White House. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters. “Out of the park or you will be sprayed,” an officer shouted at the crowd.

According to Fox, ""Vittert and the crew were punched and hit with projectiles as they fled, and a Fox News camera was broken when a member of the mob tried to grab it.""Journalists from rival outlets supported the Fox crew and condemned the violence.

JENNIFER: TH Advertisement National coronavirus updates: Top health officials monitoring nationwide protests in fear of virus spread Share Shares Copy Link Copy The latest:There have been more than 1.9 million coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The U.S. death toll has surpassed 110,000 people, according to Hopkins.The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month.New World Health Organization guidance recommends that fabric masks — which can be homemade — be at least three layers.Health officials have raised concern about coronavirus spread as thousands of people are now braving a pandemic to participate in the national protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday it was closely monitoring the demonstrations taking place across the U.S. and warned such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases.For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said without the lockdowns that most states put in place, that death toll could have been significantly higher.As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out and always maintain a distance.But the large protests make it hard to keep the recommended social distancing guidelines and ""may put others at risk,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.""It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal COVID-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground,"" she said.Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus.""I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,"" he said — especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.So far, more than 1,942,000 people have been infected in the U.S., and at least 110,514 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some states see rise in new casesWhile the early parts of the outbreak in the country hit dense metropolitan areas on the coast the hardest — including California and New York — the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Harris County, Texas, health officials said they identified a nursing home with both cases of the virus and deaths.On Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health said on Twitter. Utah State Rep. Suzanne Harrison called the spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend. ""Please be careful. Practice social distancing. Avoid crowds. Use masks where appropriate. Wash your hands.""Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs — including Arkansas State, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.An important drug could run out Meanwhile, as officials emphasize the U.S. is not yet out of the woods, a government official gave a stark warning. The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir last month. The drug, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola, is now used on hospitalized Covid patients. A study has shown it helps cut down the length of hospital stays.The government has been working to help Gilead ""with some of their supply chain challenges in terms of raw materials and being able to accelerate the process,"" Kadlec said.""Whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,"" he said.",0.0

Protesters began about a mile north of the White House. When they arrived at Lafayette Square, a public park directly across the street from the White House and a common protest spot, at least one activist was hurt and arrested. “Burn that flag,” chanted some participants as a group of young activists soaked an American flag with lighter fluid and set it ablaze. At least one additional arrest occurred as activists tore down barricades dividing the White House and Lafayette Square. The hundreds of participants ultimately marched to the Capitol, where another confrontation occurred with police. This time, as they surrounded two squad cars, officers pushed them back, threatening to deploy mace. “Fuck Trump,” chanted the crowd as they arrived at the Capitol before dispursing into Eastern Market. George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was allegedly killed by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, in Minneapolis Monday. Chauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter after three nights of rioting burned down and looted dozens of buildings in Minneapolis.

Your History. Your News.,http://www.afro.com,"Multiple arrests occurred as hundreds of activists marched throughout Washington D.C. for George Floyd and his supporters Friday evening. “We are standing in solidarity with our people in Minneapolis,” said event organizer Joella Roberts. “I want to remind you that the system that George Floyd was heading to was just as deadly,” she said, referring to the criminal justice system. Protesters began about a mile north of the White House. When they arrived at Lafayette Square, a public park directly across the street from the White House and a common protest spot, at least one activist was hurt and arrested. “Burn that flag,” chanted some participants as a group of young activists soaked an American flag with lighter fluid and set it ablaze. At least one additional arrest occurred as activists tore down barricades dividing the White House and Lafayette Square. The hundreds of participants ultimately marched to the Capitol, where another confrontation occurred with police. This time, as they surrounded two squad cars, officers pushed them back, threatening to deploy mace. “Fuck Trump,” chanted the crowd as they arrived at the Capitol before dispursing into Eastern Market. George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was allegedly killed by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, in Minneapolis Monday. Chauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter after three nights of rioting burned down and looted dozens of buildings in Minneapolis. Widely seen video footage showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for minutes as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Floyd was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.

Your History. Your News.,http://www.afro.com,"Thousands of activists and protesters took to the streets of New York City on Friday to speak out against police brutality and to show solidarity with George Floyd, the Minneapolis man choked to death earlier this week. The first of two major protests began around 4 p.m. at Foley Square in Lower Manhattan before moving north to Centre Street and White Street, with the largest group leading a standoff with the New York City police in front of the Manhattan Detention Complex and the New York Criminal Courts Building. Throughout the march, protesters, many wearing medical masks and gloves to avoid possible infection from the virus that causes COVID-19, shouted slogans such as “I can’t breathe!” and “Shut it down!” The loudest and most repeated message was “No justice, no peace.” Standing in solidarity with the protesters in the center of Foley Square was the mother of Eric Garner, who died in New York in 2014 after being put in a police choke hold. As the afternoon turned into early evening the protest became more tense, as water bottles and various objects were thrown at officers. One protester managed to spray-paint “FTP” on one New York Police Department van, and George Floyd’s name on the side of the jail, though several protesters in the crowd tried to prevent her from doing this. As a second, smaller group rejoined the main protest and remained in the streets, the police began moving in with pepper spray and making arrests. Mayor Bill de Blasio held a press conference in which he promised the NYPD would respect the rights of protesters. “Our police officers have been given clear instructions, as always: respect peaceful protest. We in this city have a long history of respecting every kind of viewpoint.” As the evening wore on, a second large protest began at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Thousands gathered in front of the sports arena, many clashing with officers who had set up barricades to prevent access to the site. Police used their batons on protesters, making numerous arrests before the event was over. The protests in New York were just one among dozens of cities holding similar rallies, and remained otherwise largely peaceful compared with Atlanta, Charlotte or Minneapolis. Floyd, a 46-year-old from Minneapolis, was killed during his arrest on Monday. Video taken from the event showed a white officer kneeling on the back of his neck, sparking outrage and protests around the country. Former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin was arrested Friday afternoon, though the other officers involved in Floyd’s death have not yet been charged.

""He said, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you can do for your country.'""""So I'm coming down here and putting my little bit in, you know?""It was a scene that played out across the country after protests demanding justice in the death of George Floyd. The Minneapolis police officer seen in a video kneeling on Floyd's neck was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.But that development wasn't enough to quell the anger of protesters in more than 30 cities, where demonstrations left charred vehicles, broken glass, litter and debris.KTRK reported one of its photojournalists saw Irving cleaning around 2 a.m. He said he spent about four hours cleaning the city, his home of more than 50 years.Irving said he understood the anger that has fueled protests in Minneapolis and across the country this week after Floyd's death.

Many of the volunteers told CNN they were with local churches.G.J. Hawkins told CNN that he and his wife, Shanna, were at Friday's protest before things got out of hand. At that point, he said they felt good about what happened, like they ""really did write history.""Video: Damage and clean up after Minneapolis protests""We were super excited, and then we turned on the news and about 30 minutes later we started to see riots. We began to get very disappointed,"" he said, adding, ""But we don't think those things overshadow all the good that was accomplished.""The couple banded together with another friend and put out a call on social media for help cleaning up the city. They said many people responded and were cleaning up sites all over Atlanta.""We feel like it's our duty as Christ followers to not only stand up for justice but to also stand up for our city,"" G.J. Hawkins said. ""One of the ways we get to express that is by helping to clean up and rebuilding.""Shanna Hawkins said she felt good about joining the clean up effort.""As we pursue justice it's very important for us to do this with peace,"" she said. ""We have to do this in unity, in love — that's the only way we're going to see real change.""'They were just coming to help each other'Saturday wasn't the first time this week communities worked to restore their neighborhoods after protests.On Friday, CNN affiliate WCCO reported that communities all over Minneapolis worked together to be part of something positive after a night of destructive protests, converging on the destruction to clean up and repair the aftermath.WCCO showed footage of volunteers boarding up broken windows, sweeping broken glass and picking up litter.""Just the community coming together to beautify north Minneapolis has been amazing,"" DeVonna Pittman told WCCO. ""When we first got out here this morning it was devastating, but people showed up and folks came out here in droves. We can see the difference.""Video: Aftermath of protests in PittsburghFelicia Perry, executive director of the West Broadway Business and Area Coalition, told WCCO that she'd been confident that neighbors would respond to a call for help.""I knew the community would come and so what you are seeing is a reflection of the work a lot of us have already been doing when we've been looking out for each other, when we've been taking care of each other, when we've been supporting each other's respective work,"" she said.The mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota, at a news conference Saturday took a moment to praise communities working together to rebuild.""Across the Twin Cities yesterday, across St. Paul yesterday, we saw countless neighbors show up for each other,"" Mayor Melvin Carter said. ""We saw people show up with a broom and a bucket, a rag to clean, and just work together.""""They weren't cleaning their cousin's store or their uncle's store,"" he added. ""They were just coming to help each other, to clean up our city.""",0.0

I also want to continue to stress the importance of reducing risks of spreading COVID-19 while protesters peacefully express their First Amendment rights. — Governor Larry Hogan (@GovLarryHogan) May 31, 2020 Gov. Larry Hogan thanked Baltimore city leaders and demonstrators for their efforts to keep gatherings this weekend peaceful for the most part. He showed his thanks to Mayor Jack Young, Police Commissioner Michael Harrison, city and state police, and “the vast majority” of demonstrators’ efforts to keep the gatherings “safe and respectful,” He added that he wanted to stress the importance of reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19 while protestors peacefully expressed their First Amendment rights. Earlier in the day, dozens of vehicles took part in a car caravan protest, which began in the city’s Station North neighborhood. Some stood holding signs reading “No justice, no peace, no racist police” and #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd.” Demonstrators gathered at City Hall later in the day, and most remained peaceful. Video also captured a bottle being thrown in the direction of police outside City Hall, and a Baltimore Police car that had its rear windshield and rear passenger window smashed out earlier in the day. WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren reported that police arrived in riot gear around 9:30 p.m. after people set off fireworks outside City Hall and were seen standing on top of city-owned vans that were spray-painted with graffiti.

During a press conference Saturday, Mayor Jack Young urged people to protest peacefully. “We will protect your right for peaceful protests,” Young said. “But I have zero tolerance for anything that approaches chaos and law-breaking.” “I can’t have our city turned to chaos,” Mayor Young added. “We will not let outside influencers come into the City of Baltimore and create chaos.” Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said the department is helping citizens exercise their First Amendment rights. He added that they are in a constant state of planning and in contact with Maryland State Police. In an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union, Gov. Larry Hogan said in 2015, when the Freddie Gray protests and riots occurred, the state acted “really decisively,” and sent in the National Guard and extra police presence to allow Baltimore residents to protest peacefully- a type of protesting that he thinks the country is seeing in many cities across America.

The protest included a caravan of cars and trucks plastered with “Black Lives Matter” signs – horns beeping, fists thrust out of windows – and a crowd on foot chanting, “No justice, no peace, no racist police” and “When black lives are under attack, stand up, fight back.” The group marched in Old Goucher, West Baltimore, Mount Vernon, Harbor East and – late Saturday evening – assembled in front of City Hall, demanding an end to police brutality. There the demonstrators were met by about 70 Baltimore Police in riot gear, where some tense confrontations erupted, including police at one point firing pepper balls. There was no major reported property damage. A display window was smashed at a bank building on Lombard Street, and a police van was defaced with graffiti. There appeared to have been no violent outbreaks during the confrontations downtown. (A widely circulated video showed some people throwing water bottles and a young woman telling them to stop.) After yelling and pressing against police barricades at City Hall – and chasing off a TV crew – members of the crowd began dispersing about 10 p.m., many headed for the Inner Harbor. “You continue to kill us!” Unlike dozens of other U.S. cities racked by rioting and looting, the demonstrations in Baltimore were overwhelmingly peaceful. The mostly young, racially diverse crowd of marchers kept their cool. But what the day of action had on vivid display, for hours, was bristling anger. The mostly young, racially diverse crowd kept their cool. But what the day of action had on vivid display, for hours, was bristling anger. The march passed through Penn-North, the neighborhood that erupted five years ago when another young black man, Freddie Gray, died in police custody. At those 2015 protests, sometimes known as “The Uprising,” signs bore the names of previous victims of police violence. Yesterday’s march had new names along with that of Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes as he lay on the ground, handcuffed. “You continue to kill us! Why? Why?” one man’s sign read. “It’s a generational thing. If we don’t stand up to this injustice, it will continue to go on,” said 24-year-old Malik Turner, who is a resident advisor for a dorm at Towson University. “If we don’t stand up to this injustice, it will continue to go on” – Malik Turner. “The way I see it, the whole government is here to protect the cops,” he said. “This is the best way to use our voice – show we’re tired of this and empowered to move forward.” “Nothing seems to change” The failure of Minneapolis authorities to immediately fire and charge the four officers involved in Floyd’s violent arrest was especially frustrating for Shaun Crombey. “We march all the time and nothing seems to change,” said Crombey, 26, who’s originally from Philadelphia but has lived in Baltimore for the past eight years. “It comes to a point where you can’t take it anymore and you get angry.” Since President Donald Trump’s election in 2016, Crombey said he’s experienced more and more racist behavior. “Racist people have come out of the woodwork and are a lot more bold with it,” Crombey said. “I hadn’t had to deal with racism since forever, but now it’s small things. Like you see a lady you’re walking behind clutch her purse in response to you. Those sorts of things piss you off.” The Final Straw Forrest Caskey, a 44-year-old professor at Anne Arundel Community College, said watching the video of Floyd moaning,”I can’t breathe,” as Officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee pinned against Floyd’s neck was “the final straw.” “Growing up with a lot of black people in my life, seeing how my experience is so different from theirs, this was incredibly painful,” he said. As a white person who primarily teaches students from marginalized communities, Caskey said he’s tried to fight racism his whole life. “Every black student I’ve taught has a story of something the police did to them, whether it’s an unnecessary stop or arrest,” he said. Stand up, Push Back In some of the places the protesters marched, their presence was jarring. In upscale Harbor East, where restaurants were open for the first time in months, they passed by dressed-up diners sipping their wine and eating their entrees. In neighborhoods away from the waterfront, the protesters were greeted with raised fists and cheers. In Sandtown, a city trash truck driver leaned on his horn. “It’s a breath of fresh air. I’m glad my kids are getting to see this,” said Trina Ross, who was sitting on her front step with her father and three children snapping pictures. “It’s time people stand up and push back. It’s the only way things are going to change.”",0.0

At a Saturday afternoon press conference, Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young and City Council President Brandon Scott applauded the largely peaceful demonstrations and urged “outside agitators” to stay away. “There is an incredible amount of pain running through our country right now, and I understand that,” Young said. “I’m angry and frustrated and fed up.” “I want you to demand justice, I want you to speak up for change, I want you to hold us accountable,” he continued. “But you must do it lawfully.” It was a rare moment of collaboration for the two, who have frequently clashed as they compete in the June 2 Democratic primary. “Baltimore, I come before you today not just as your Council President, but as a tired young black man,” Scott said. “Being black in America is exhausting. If you’re outside of Baltimore thinking about coming, do us a favor. Stay home. We don’t want you here. You didn’t come to Baltimore after 2015. We don’t want you here now.” Scott was seen outside of City Hall last night as hundreds thronged the plaza in front of the building and maintained an edgy standoff with city police clad in riot gear. Young, who did not make an appearance at the scene, sent tweets last night condemning “agitators” and encouraging citizens to be “peaceful and productive” and finally to just “go home.” Here’s what some other Baltimore mayoral candidates had to say: Dixon: “I stand in solidarity” Former Mayor Sheila Dixon, writing on Twitter, said she is praying for the city and nation. She was one of the only candidates to address the need for physical distancing as the protests coincide with the coronavirus pandemic. “Protesting is a powerful tool for demanding justice and expressing dissatisfaction with systems that have failed black and brown communities far too many times,” she wrote. “I stand in solidarity with those protesting peacefully but urge participants to not destroy resources/stores that support our community.” “I will continue my commitment to work diligently to dismantle systemic injustices,” she continued. “Please stay safe and practice social distancing while out. Let’s lift each other up in these trying times.” Miller: “Thoroughly justified” Mary Miller, whose association with a PAC trying to get her elected by targeting the white vote has brought her under scrutiny, perhaps had extra pressure to issue a strong statement on Floyd’s death and police misconduct. In an email to supporters, she called the unarmed Minneapolis man’s death after a city police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes “murder.” “The thoroughly justified anguish and outrage Black Americans across this country – and in Baltimore – are feeling after the murder of George Floyd and centuries of oppression, serves to remind us that police brutality and racism are still with us.” She continued. “I support the right to protest for change. In the coming days, I pray for peaceful protest here in Baltimore, and I pray for justice for George Floyd. In the long term, I pray for a culture where Black people do not live in fear of their neighbors or those meant to protect them, where law enforcement coexists and engages safely with communities of color, and where Black Lives Matter.” “I’m also taught that faith without works is dead,” Miller said, pivoting to her familiar campaign pledge to promote “systems of accountability” as mayor, such as the current consent decree between Baltimore Police and the U.S. Department of Justice. Vignarajah: “Ruthless murder” Thiru Vignarajah, who has vigorusly campaigned on a pledge to reduce violent crime in Baltimore, had this to say on Twitter: “Some cases do not have two sides. The murder of George Floyd should be charged, prosecuted and discussed as what it was – a ruthless murder. The anger across the country is deserved. A man’s life was snuffed out on camera, echoing countless scenes as old as American history.” Vignarajah later touted his connection to Gary Tuggle, Baltimore’s “renowned” acting police commissioner for 11 months (May 2018 to March 2019) who has endorsed his candidacy. Smith: “I felt a lot of that pain” Former BPD spokesman T.J. Smith, who is also running in the primary, addressed Floyd’s death, saying, “I’m angry and sad at the same time.” “Even before George Floyd was murdered, this week has shown us how racism and implicit bias rears it’s ugly head,” he tweeted, linking to an earlier Instagram post in which he talks about the black man birdwatching in Central Park who a white female dogwalker called the police on. “I’ve been pulled over by the police as the police and questioned about why I’m in a certain area,” Smith said, also describing an incident 20 years ago in which he said he was “profiled” and stopped for alleged shoplifting. “I felt a lot of that pain,” he said.

The president has said that members of the loosely defined far-left group Antifa — short for ""anti-fascists"" — have led clashes with police and looting in cities across the U.S. since the killing of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis. It's unclear if any group or groups are primarily responsible for escalating protests that began following George Floyd's death on May 25 as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has told the press that he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence. In one tweet on Sunday, Trump said the U.S. ""will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" It's something he has previously floated, and last year two Republican senators introduced a resolution that sought to designate the group as a domestic terrorist organization. Following Trump's tweet, Attorney General William Barr said in a statement that ""[f]ederal law enforcement actions will be directed at apprehending and charging the violent radical agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest."" Barr added: ""The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly."" The clashes, spreading to dozens of cities across the U.S., follow a series of racist incidents and deaths of black people, including Floyd's on Monday. Chauvin, now a former Minneapolis police officer, was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck while holding him in custody as Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers present at the scene have been fired but not arrested or charged. Protests and clashes that have since followed come at a time of unprecedented crisis for the country, with confirmed deaths from the coronavirus pandemic topping 100,000 and millions of people out of work as a result of broad business shutdowns. Minorities, including African Americans, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 deaths and pandemic-induced economic peril. ""The death of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis was a grave tragedy. It should never have happened. It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger, and grief."" pic.twitter.com/lirAMSv4Wo — The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 30, 2020 Trump addressed the demonstrations Saturday, striking a milder tone than he has on Twitter during prepared remarks following a space launch in Florida. He said Floyd's death ""has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger and grief."" He added that he ""understands the pain that people are feeling"" and supports peaceful protest, but that ""the memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists."" ""He should just sometimes stop talking"" Apart from Saturday's remarks, though, Trump has not often played a unifying role in recent days. His tweets about radical-left anarchists have also included criticism of Democratic leadership in Minnesota. In another tweet on Sunday, he blamed the mainstream media for fomenting ""hatred and anarchy."" Time for a change! #2020 https://t.co/AECy2GBfys — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020 On Friday, Trump tweeted provocatively that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase with a racist history that Trump said he was not aware of. Later on, he said his intent was not to make a threat but to register a statement of concern that armed violence can accompany looting. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, said on Fox News Sunday that the president's tweets about demonstrations turning violent are ""not constructive."" Speaking on ABC's This Week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Sunday morning that she's not paying attention to Trump's inflammatory tweets. Instead, she said he ""should be a unifying force in our country. We have seen that with Democratic and Republican presidents all along. They have seen their responsibility to be the president of the United States, to unify our country and not to fuel the flame."" Also Sunday, Keisha Lance Bottoms — mayor of Atlanta, one city that has seen protests and clashes with police — told CBS' Face the Nation that Trump's tweets are ""making it worse"" and ""he should just sometimes stop talking."" In his own statement on Saturday, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, wrote that ""Protesting [Floyd's killing] is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not."" He added that as president, he'd lead the conversation about turning the nation's ""anguish to purpose."" Biden made an unannounced visit on Sunday to the site in Wilmington, Del., where protests had taken place the night before. ",0.0

Floyd's death after pleading for air as a white police officer in Minneapolis kneeled on his neck during an arrest has prompted protests across the country, including in Delaware.

The announcement on Saturday from the nation's eighth-largest retailer came after Target stores in multiple cities became scenes of violence and unrest. Among the stores where aisles were ransacked was a Target in Minneapolis near the city's 3rd police precinct, where the four officers who were fired after Floyd's death worked. The 3rd Precinct police station was damaged by a fire last week. ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,"" the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. ""At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores."" A Target spokesperson said that the company is evaluating closures and limiting hours on a store-by-store basis. The majority of stores being closed are located in Minnesota and California, where protests in Los Angeles led the National Guard to be deployed. Stores will also close in Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Despite the violence that has hit its stores, the company has voiced support for demonstrators. ""The murder of George Floyd has unleashed the pent-up pain of years, as have the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote in a public letter on Friday. ""We say their names and hold a too-long list of others in our hearts."" It remains unclear whether the looting at Target stores was committed by demonstrators or whether they were the actions of unaffiliated bad actors. But the ongoing demonstrations have focused scrutiny on Target's past work with law enforcement — including partnerships with agencies in at least 2o cities. In Minneapolis, the company partnered with police on a program that helped install closed-circuit television cameras in the downtown area. A 2010 report released with support from the company said the ""genesis of the program was a widespread feeling some years ago in the city of Minneapolis that the downtown business district was not a pleasant place to work or visit.""

U.S. law allows terrorist designations for foreign groups since belonging to those groups doesn't enjoy the same protections. Antifa, short for anti-fascists, describes a broad group of people whose positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across. Typically, groups who identify as Antifa are amorphous and don't have a central leadership, though some local activists are highly organized, according to federal law enforcement officials. That has made it difficult for U.S. law enforcement to deal with violence from members of groups that label themselves as Antifa. Federal law enforcement officials told CNN they are aware of outside groups who are behind some of the property destruction and violence, using the cover of the legitimate protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere. Those domestic extremist groups include anarchists, white supremacists and far-left extremists, some of whom have overlapping affiliations.An announcement by the Justice Department on Sunday to use Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country to investigate some of the violence in major cities singles out leftist Antifa activity, though U.S. law enforcement officials say there are groups from both the extremist left and right involved in the riots and attacks on police. In response to the president's tweet, ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi said there is ""no legal authority for designating a domestic group"" as a terrorist organization.""As this tweet demonstrates, terrorism is an inherently political label, easily abused and misused. There is no legal authority for designating a domestic group. Any such designation would raise significant due process and First Amendment concerns.""The Justice Department has studied the issue of creating a domestic terrorism law to apply to people involved in violence and who belong to domestic extremist groups, but the constitutional issues have been a hurdle to that effort.",0.0

But if you're coming here to throw bricks or break storefront windows or break police vehicles, you're going to find yourself in a jail cell. That's a promise,"" Mayor Jack Young said Sunday.Hundreds of demonstrators began the afternoon with a motorcade through city streets protesting police brutality and Floyd's death. Floyd was a 46-year-old black man who died last week after a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, used his knee to pin him down in an incident captured on video. The officer, Derek Chauvin, who was among four who were fired, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, according to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman.By the evening, crowds gathered at City Hall and other points of downtown Baltimore. Some people in the crowd threw objects at police and others broke windows at The Gallery and Harborplace among other places. Harrison said there was destruction of property at eight locations and burglaries at 11 locations.""For those who wish to agitate and incite violence during what was mostly peaceful demonstrations, your actions will absolutely not be tolerated,"" Harrison said.The mayor described the instigators as agitators trying to rile things up, but the majority of the protesters helped control them.Harrison said officers ""continued to serve with an unparalleled level of professionalism, tolerance and restraint.""City Council President Brandon Scott said, ""Baltimoreans said, 'No, you're not going to come from outside of Baltimore, hijack Baltimore and then run back home.'""Despite the incidences of violence, the demonstrations were largely peaceful through the day.""A majority of the protests in Baltimore remained peaceful over this weekend. I want to thank the many peaceful protesters who worked alongside our officers in allowing us to keep them safe,"" Harrison said.""In Baltimore yesterday, we were a national example of what it looks like to engage in passionate protesting without widespread breaking of the law,"" Young said.Young thanked the city's police officers, saying, ""The residents of Baltimore are behind you."" He and Harrison also thanked Gov. Larry Hogan for coordinating and making state resources available.""The city has been working closely with Maryland State Police and the governor's office. He told us that the state is here to assist the city and I want to thank him for that,"" Young said.""I want to thank Gov. Hogan, the Maryland State Police and the National Guard for their continued support for the planning and execution in delivering resources and keeping residents safe during peaceful demonstrations,"" Harrison said.In a series of tweets Sunday morning, the governor said Baltimore showed the nation how to assemble to promote positive change: ""I want to thank Mayor Jack Young, Commissioner Harrison and Maryland State Police and the vast majority of demonstrators for their efforts to keep gatherings safe and respectful.""We are continuing to monitor this situation closely and are ready to quickly respond to any changes on the ground.

Advertisement What is Antifa? Share Shares Copy Link Copy As protests over George Floyd's death spread across the country, officials have blamed the violent nature of some demonstrations on members of a controversial group known as Antifa.President Donald Trump on Sunday said the United States would designate Antifa a terrorist organization, though the federal government has no legal authority to label a wholly domestic group the way it designates foreign terrorist organizations.Speaking at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday, Trump said the recent ""violence and vandalism"" seen across the country ""is being led by Antifa and other radical left-wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down buildings.""The president did not provide any evidence for his assertion.National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien echoed Trump's comments on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday morning, telling Jake Tapper that the violence ""is being driven by Antifa.""CNN has not independently verified whether the group is involved in recent protests.Here's a closer look at Antifa protesters, who have become more visible in the last several years.What is Antifa?Antifa is short for anti-fascists. The term is used to define a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far left — but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. The group doesn't have an official leader or headquarters, although groups in certain states hold regular meetings.Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across.Scott Crow, a former Antifa organizer, says the ""radical ideals"" promoted by Antifas are starting to be adopted by liberals. ""They would never have looked at (those ideals) before, because they saw us as the enemy as much as the right-wingers.""The majority of Antifa members don't fall into a stereotype. Since the election of President Trump, however, most new Antifa members are young voters.How did the group start?The exact origins of the group are unknown, but Antifa can be traced to Nazi Germany and Anti-Fascist Action, a militant group founded in the 1980s in the United Kingdom.Modern-day Antifa members have become more active in making themselves known at public rallies and within the progressive movement, says Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.""What they're trying to do now is not only become prominent through violence at these high-profile rallies, but also to reach out through small meetings and through social networking to cultivate disenfranchised progressives who heretofore were peaceful,"" Levin said.Where do they protest?Members have been spotted at high-profile, right-wing events across the country.In August 2017 members of the group showed up in Charlottesville, Virginia, to condemn racism and counter protest hundreds of white nationalists opposed to the removal of a Gen. Robert E. Lee statue. The protests turned violent when James Fields, who is not a member of Antifa, plowed his car through a crowd of counter protesters, killing Heather Heyer.Video above: President Trump Says There Were 'Bad Dudes on the Other Side' in CharlottesvilleEarlier that year, Antifa protested the appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos, an alt-right provocateur, at the University of California, Berkeley. They also protested President Trump's inauguration in 2017.While it can be difficult to distinguish Antifa activists from other protesters, some dress head to toe in black. Members call this the ""Black Bloc.""They also wear masks to hide their identities from the police and whomever they are protesting.Why are they controversial?The group is known for causing damage to property during protests. In Berkeley, black-clad protesters wearing masks threw Molotov cocktails and smashed windows at the student union center where the Yiannopoulos event was to be held.Crow, who was involved with Antifa for almost 30 years, said members use violence as a means of self-defense and they believe property destruction does not equate to violence.""There is a place for violence. Is that the world that we want to live in? No. Is it the world we want to inhabit? No. Is it the world we want to create? No. But will we push back? Yes,"" Crow said.Levin said Antifa activists feel the need to partake in violence because ""they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist.""""There's this 'It's going down' mentality and this 'Hit them with your boots' mentality that goes back many decades to confrontations that took place, not only here in the American South, but also in places like Europe,"" he added.White nationalists and other members of the so-called alt-right have denounced members of Antifa, sometimes calling them the ""alt-left."" Many white nationalists from the Charlottesville rallies claimed it was the Antifa groups that led the protests to turn violent.Peter Cvjetanovic, a white nationalist who attended the Virginia protests, said he believes the far left, including Antifa, are ""just as dangerous, if not more dangerous than the right wing could ever be.""""These are people who preach tolerance and love while at the same time threatening people with a different political ideology. We go to our rallies and they harass us and attack us but they held theirs and we ignore them. You don't see right-wing protests get like this,"" Cvjetanovic told KRNV.But Crow said the philosophy of Antifa is based on the idea of direct action. ""The idea in Antifa is that we go where they (right-wingers) go. That hate speech is not free speech. That if you are endangering people with what you say and the actions that are behind them, then you do not have the right to do that.""And so we go to cause conflict, to shut them down where they are, because we don't believe that Nazis or fascists of any stripe should have a mouthpiece.""",0.0

During a virtual news conference Sunday afternoon, Young thanked protesters for remaining peaceful as they called attention to the death of George Floyd, who died after being arrested by police in Minneapolis. Four officers involved in Floyd’s arrest were fired after video showed one officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. That officer, Derek Chauvin, has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. WJZ COMPLETE COVERAGE: George Floyd’s Death And Its Impacts In Maryland While clashes between police and civilians following demonstrations have been reported from New York City to Los Angeles, Baltimore has largely escaped the violence. “In Baltimore yesterday, we were a national example of what it looks like to engage in passionate protesting without widespread breaking of the law,” Young said. There were several reports, though, of what Young described as “unlawful behavior” that was “dealt with swiftly.” Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said 14 people, including two minors, were arrested overnight after numerous businesses were damaged or burglarized. 12 Adults, 2 Juveniles Arrested After Businesses Were Damaged In Downtown Baltimore Overnight, Police Say Both also praised the police department, whose officers Harrison said, “continued to serve with an unparalleled level of professionalism, tolerance and restraint.” The mayor also issued a stern warning to those hoping to cause destruction. “I want to reiterate a point I made yesterday: if you’re coming to Baltimore to protest peacefully, we welcome you, but if you’re coming here to throw bricks or break storefront windows or destroy police vehicles, you’re going to find yourself in a jail cell.

The National Guard has also been activated in around a dozen states and the District of Columbia. - Target has temporarily closed 175 stores because of protests, CNN reported. In Minnesota, 71 stores are closed, 49 are closed in California, 12 are closed in New York, and the rest are closed in various other states. Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country convulsed through another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. • In Indianapolis, police were investigating ""multiple shootings"" downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. • In Jacksonville, Florida, an officer was ""stabbed or slashed in the neck and is currently in the hospital,"" Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams told a press conference Saturday evening, CNN reported. Sheriff Williams said other officers were attacked by rioters and hit with rocks and bricks during protests in the city. Many arrests were made, he said, though he did not have a precise number. • In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. • In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. • In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. • In Los Angeles, protesters chanted ""Black Lives Matter,"" some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. • And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. Video: New York protesters set fires, clash with police   ""The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. ""We don't tolerate excessive use of force,"" Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. ""The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,"" said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. ""It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities."" Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to ""quell this situation."" Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. ""l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: ""Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring ""No games!"" and saying police in New York City ""must be allowed to do their job!"" Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. ""The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,"" Biden said in a statement Saturday night. At least 25 cities across 16 states have imposed curfews as of early Sunday. The National Guard has also been activated in around a dozen states and the District of Columbia. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. VIDEO: In California, demonstrators throw fireworks toward officers   The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an ""invisible enemy."" The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. ""Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. ""Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice."" This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would ""have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen."" Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. CNN contributed to this report.",0.0

At a news conference Saturday, city leaders invoked the riots that took place five years ago after Freddie Gray died in police custody and focused an international spotlight on the city. They urged protesters to take a peaceful approach this time. Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young said he believes outsiders instigated the violence in 2015 and called on Baltimoreans to reject outside agitation to violence. “I can’t have our city turn into chaos,” he said. “We will not let outside influence come into the city of Baltimore and commit chaos in our city.” Protests Friday night in Baltimore were generally peaceful, though police say they are investigating a video showing an officer punching out a woman after she struck another officer. Saturday’s protests began in the afternoon and were larger. At one point, officers had to barricade City Hall as a crowd gathered outside.

Photos by Caitlynn Peetz As protests continued for the sixth day across the country, about 200 protesters gathered in Germantown, marching for hours and demanding justice after a white officer was charged with killing a black man in Minnesota. The demonstration was peaceful as the crowd stopped in major intersections, sitting for several minutes and blocking traffic while chanting “No justice. No peace,” “I can’t breathe” and “Say his name. George Floyd” during a protest that lasted about seven hours. There have been protests in cities around the country in response to the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Minneapolis man. He died on May 25 after police officer Derek Chauvin pinned him to the ground for several minutes and pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck, even though Floyd was saying he could not breathe. Police have said they were responding to a 911 call reporting that someone used a fake $20 bill to buy something at a store. Chauvin’s actions were captured on video by a bystander. He has been charged with murder and manslaughter. Protests bubbled over in some cities this weekend, leading to vehicles and businesses being damaged and looted. Throughout Sunday’s protest in Germantown, Montgomery County police blocked roads as the crowd approached. There didn’t appear to be any altercations between protesters and law enforcement as officers watched from the fringes. As the protest developed, police closed Germantown Road between Aircraft Drive and Crystal Rock Drive. At one point, protesters sat in a line across the road with their signs. Some people carried cases of water bottles and offered them to protesters. Some handed bottles to police officers. Naeemah Hill of Gaithersburg carried cardboard signs that said “Make George Floyd the last one killed by PIGS” and “Defund MCP,” which referred to Montgomery County police. Hill said she attended Saturday night’s protests in D.C. and was there “until the wee hours of the morning.” Hill said she planned to rest on Sunday, but decided to join the Germantown protest when she heard about it from her sister. “How does a guy [Chauvin] that kills a man in broad daylight on camera get a bail? Bail. There’s no bail for a black man,” she said. Hill said she has been protesting for police reform since the early 1990s, following the 1991 beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles. Tracey Noland of Germantown said she first saw the protest on Facebook Live, starting at 11 a.m. She joined in the afternoon. At one point, she said, protesters knelt at the intersection of Germantown and Middlebrook roads for nine minutes to symbolize how llong Chauvin could be seen pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck. “I’d never seen a protest so close [to home], and I’m glad to have the opportunity to join, and that’s why we’re out here today,” Noland said. In February, the personal finance website WalletHub named Germantown — which is unincorporated — the third most diverse small city in the country. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 24% of residents are black, 18% are Asian, 24% are Hispanic and 32% are white. Around 6 p.m. on Sunday, at the intersection of Germantown Road and Aircraft Road, the crowd began dispersing. “You did a good thing today. It’s time to go home,” a woman said into a megaphone. Slowly, people did. Some lagged behind and talked, and police asked them to move out of the street. Others picked up trash that was left behind. Police have Response Team ready Earlier Sunday, Montgomery County police said they had not heard any reports of protests in the county on Saturday, but they were prepared if there were any. Capt. Tom Jordan wrote in an email on Sunday morning that police were “monitoring events happening across the country and nearby.” “We have police resources available in the event that a protest or demonstrations occur within Montgomery County. We have a Special Events Response Team available in the event anything happens within the County,” he wrote. Second District Commander Sean Gagen, whose patrol area includes Chevy Chase, Bethesda and Potomac, said in an interview Sunday that he didn’t know of any planned protests in his territory, but the department is “gathering information every day” on whether there might be protests and sharing it with each district commander. “My plan for the Second District is we’re going to be increasing our presence throughout the commercial business districts, down along Friendship Heights, Chevy Chase and the D.C. line and throughout the Bethesda central business district,” he said. Gagen said Saks Fifth Avenue at 5555 Wisconsin Ave. in Friendship Heights was damaged on Saturday, but he couldn’t confirm it was connected to protests or rioting in D.C. “I think it’s too soon to try to link it to the rioting and looting in D.C., but that’s something we’re looking into,” he said. Gagen didn’t know what time officers responded to the scene. He said when police got there, “multiple vehicles” were leaving and headed into D.C. He said police are investigating the damage as a commercial burglary, but aren’t sure if anything was taken. Statements Multiple law enforcement agencies have released statements in the last week expressing anger over Floyd’s death, including Montgomery County police Chief Marcus Jones. “The acts of these officers in Minneapolis are not representative of our profession and they are certainly not representative of the values of our department as a whole,” Jones wrote in a statement, WJLA reported. Rockville Police Chief Victor Brito also condemned the killing of Floyd in a statement and said he is concerned about the possible breakdown of police-community relations. “RCPD has worked tirelessly and will continue to build and maintain trust and partnership with our community.

Police custody. The rage out there is predictable. It's understandable, and it's legitimate. Unfortunately, it's being expressed right now over the past week in ways that are destructive. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, praise those who kept their protests peaceful. The raw emotions were on display, and, as I said yesterday, the beautiful expression of solidarity in community that we saw played out by peaceful protestors demonstrations elsewhere Saturday also began peacefully, right. More than two dozen cities nationwide had nighttime curfews in place, and protesters came out anyway, in some cases descending into chaos and destruction. Mayor Kesha Let's bottoms have seen two straight nights of protests in Atlanta. Right now we're talking about cars being burned and businesses being vandalized, and there's still so many issues that are right before us that we've lost. Sign up. Georgia is one of more than a dozen states, plus the District of Columbia that have activated the National Guard to respond to undressed Advertisement President Trump briefly taken to underground bunker during Friday's White House protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy As protesters gathered outside the White House Friday night in Washington, D.C., President Donald Trump was briefly taken to the underground bunker for a period of time, according to a White House official.The president was there for a little under an hour before being brought upstairs. It's unclear if First Lady Melania Trump and Barron Trump were also taken down with him.Trump has repeatedly praised the Secret Service for its handling of the protests outside the White House Friday night in the wake of George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis.The New York Times first reported Trump was taken to the bunker.The decision to physically move the president came as protesters confronted Secret Service officers outside the White House for hours on Friday — shouting, throwing water bottles and other objects at the line of officers, and attempting to break through the metal barriers.At times, the crowd would remove the metal barriers and begin pushing up against the officers and their riot shields. The Secret Service continually replaced the barriers throughout the night as protesters wrestled them away.Protesters pushed hard enough a few times that officers had to walk away with what appeared to be minor injuries. At one point, the agents responded to aggressive pushing and yelling by using pepper spray on the protesters.Throughout the night, protesters could be heard chanting their support for Floyd, an unarmed black man who died last week after being pinned down by a white police officer, and their dislike of Trump. The protest, which began around 10 p.m. ET, Friday night outside the White House, had mostly quieted down by 3:30 a.m. ET, Saturday morning.The crowd thinned out and Secret Service officers were able to expand their perimeter and barriers around Lafayette Park across from the White House.Six arrests were made during the protests, the Secret Service confirmed in a statement Saturday afternoon.The president on Thursday had used the threat of police retaliation and military intervention in Minnesota where protests turned violent and destructive — saying on Twitter that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""Trump's tweets on Saturday also invoked imagery tied to brutal civil rights-era police tactics.Now, a serious divide has emerged among the President's top allies and advisers over how the president should address several nights of protests and riots.Trump is being urged by some advisers to formally address the nation and call for calm, while others have said he should condemn the rioting and looting more forcefully or risk losing middle-of-the-road voters in November, according to several sources familiar with the deliberations.",0.0

Protestors spread along Route 50 holding signs that say things like Justice Four Floyd, Stop Murder and Honk for Justice. Some protestors tell 47ABC although they are not against police officers they believe they’re not always held accountable for their actions. They also tell us they’re tired of having to tell their kids to act in a certain way with authority so that their lives are not put at risk. “So, we have to do more as black mothers to talk to our black children and let them know the proper way of making the cops feel comfortable,” said LeeAnn Sampson. “We don’t have an issue with the police, but if the police has an issue within our community they need to hold them accountable for it,” said Cephas. “Justice needs to be served,” said Cephas. Protestors add that all four police officers involved in Floyd’s death must be held accountable and that protests like this one will help bring justice. “This is what we are here to do,” said Sampson. “We’re supposed to unite together and bring awareness and pass laws to get justice to be served,” said Sampson They also hope this protest will bring awareness and let everyone know that this community can work together to help make a difference. “It’s important for the world to see that Cambridge can come together over the most difficult issues, not that we think that everything’s been solved, we have a long way to go and we want people to know that Cambridge is here doing this in a very positive way,” said Mary Handley. Protestors also tell us they hope conversations about things like police violence will continue around the country to help bring change. They’re also urging everyone to vote on Tuesday and make a difference.",0.0

Photos by Caitlynn Peetz Montgomery County Council Member Will Jawando on Sunday said he plans to introduce local legislation that would declare racism a public health emergency. Jawando spoke to a crowd of more than 100 people gathered at Pilgrim Hills Local Park in the White Oak area to grieve the deaths of black people in police custody. Jawando, who is black, said “racism is embedded in every system and structure we have” in America, including health care, economic development, transportation and environmental issues. “This has been a tough week, obviously, but it’s been a tough lifetime, too,” Jawando said. “… I’ve known for a long time this system is unjust. One of the reasons I got into public service was because of that, and trying to make that change at an individual and systemic level.” He did not say when he would introduce the legislation, but in a Twitter post on Saturday, he said it would happen “in the coming week.” The ceremony on Sunday was not a protest or a rally. It was called a “homegoing ceremony” to honor George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, both black people recently killed by police. Organized by the grassroots group Racial Justice NOW!, the ceremony also honored Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was killed by armed white residents in Georgia. Attendees sat in the grass, listening to speakers. Most wore masks and sat a distance away from others who were not family or friends. Montgomery County Parks Police and county police were present, but remained at the entrance to the park, directing traffic. Robert Stubblefield, a speaker during the event, mentioned several black men who Montgomery County police shot and killed in recent years, including Robert White in 2018 and Finan Berhe in May. White, of Silver Spring, was shot and killed in June 2018 during an altercation with police. Police said White was combative and assaulted the officer. It was later revealed he was unarmed. Berhe was killed in May of this year after police say he rushed toward an officer while holding a knife. Advocates question whether Berhe was suffering from a mental health crisis and argue the officer used unnecessary force without trying to de-escalate the situation. “This isn’t something that’s happening in some other far-off place like Minneapolis,” Stubblefield said of police brutality. “This happened right here in our backyard and we cannot afford to be silent anymore.” Jawando said “the latitude for an officer to use deadly force is too wide, and we have to narrow that.” He said he is “working on several things related to the use of force” by police at the local level. “I don’t want to be here 20 years from now saying the same thing about the same young men and young women who have lost their lives at the hands of a racist system,” Jawando said. “… There’s a lot of reasons we die, but none are more pernicious and pronounced than when you see a knee on a neck for eight minutes and you have to watch — watch — someone die. It’s unacceptable.” Jawando has been an outspoken critic of police overreach in his time on the council. In January 2019, he introduced a bill that requires an independent investigation whenever a Montgomery County police officer is involved in the death of a resident. He was also co-sponsor of a bill that creates a 13-member police advisory commission to guide the department on best practices. He has publicly questioned local officers’ use of force, and, in June 2019, he said he was racially profiled when he was stopped by a state police trooper in White Oak for a minor traffic infraction.

But they have not been surprised. Racism-tinged events no longer startle even America’s closest allies, though many have watched coverage of the often-violent protests with growing unease. Burning cars and riot police in the U.S. featured on newspaper front pages around the globe May 31—bumping news of the COVID-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places. George Floyd died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a White police officer pressed a knee into his neck. It was the latest in a series of deaths of Black men and women at the hands of police in America. Thousands gathered in central London on May 31 to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting “No justice! No peace!”and waving placards with the words “ow many more?” at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn’t stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred milled around in the street and waved placards. Protesters in Denmark also converged on the U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Participants carried placards with messages such as “Stop Killing Black People.” The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on May 30 under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Several hundred more people took to the streets May 31 in the capital’s Kreuzberg area, carrying signs with slogans like “Silence is Violence,” “Hold Cops Accountable,” and “Who Do You Call When Police Murder?” No incidents were reported. Germany’s top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline “This killer-cop set America ablaze” with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The newspaper’s story reported “scenes like out of a civil war.” In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper’s senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd’s killing was “different” than previous cases of Black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence. “There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,” Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor’s warning that “anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.” In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials’ criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China’s crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: “I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?” Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America’s racial unrest by tweeting “I can’t breathe,” which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting Internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed “a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters.” Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of “setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,” without offering any evidence. Russia accused the United States of “systemic problems in the human rights sphere.” “This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.” There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to U.S. protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts. That’s a play on the slogan for Lebanon’s protest movement — Lebanon revolts — which erupted on Oct. 17 last year. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #Americanrevolts became the No. 1 trending tag in Lebanon. In another expression of solidarity with American protesters, about 150 people marched through central Jerusalem on May 30 to protest the shooting death by Israeli police of an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man earlier in the day. Israeli police mistakenly suspected that the man, Iyad Halak, was carrying a weapon. When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire. ___ Associated Press Writers David Rising in Berlin, Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Frances D’Emilio in Rome, Zeina Karam in Beirut, Tia Goldenberg in Jerusalem, Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Jari Tanner in Helsinki, Finland, and Jim Heintz in Moscow contributed to this report.",0.0

They think of this weekend’s Space X launch. Or going where no one has gone before on “Star Trek.” But the concept of space has a different meaning for African Americans. It’s about finding places in American society — White society — where we are free to just be. Those spaces have been shrinking in recent months. With the flames lit in Minneapolis spreading to other cities after yet another Black man’s death, it felt like only an airhole was left. I am tired. Tired of how routine violence against African Americans at the hands of white people has been and continues to be. Angry as a journalist that this has happened so often that we all know the angles that must be covered, the questions to be asked, the stories to be written. Angrier still that as an African-American journalist, I must explain, again and again, how dehumanizing this all is. And I think: Is doing this kind of job enough? Shouldn’t I be doing something to stop the racism, the violence against us? For years, my identities as an African American and a journalist have been in sync. Growing up, I was curious (my family would say nosy). I read my hometown newspaper religiously and watched the evening news. I especially loved how journalists used facts to shine a light on the world’s injustices while also telling stories people needed to know to make decisions in their lives. As a teenager, I attended a two-week minority journalism workshop and my career choice was set. But in recent times, the dissonance between the two parts of me has grown louder. I woke up Tuesday morning to video of George Floyd, a handcuffed man, struggling for breath while a police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Bystanders captured the video and can be heard increasingly pleading with the officer, Derek Chauvin, and three others to come to his aid. I heard echoes of Eric Garner repeated. “I can’t breathe,” said George Floyd. My heart broke. And I cried. But as a journalist, I had to put my individual feelings on the back burner. I immediately shared that horrible video to make sure my colleagues were responding to the story quickly and covering the anger arising online, on the streets of Minneapolis and beyond. I did my part. But inside, I went from anger to rage to exhaustion. The week’s misery had begun on Memorial Day when a Black man asked a White woman in Central Park to leash her dog. Birdwatcher Christian Cooper pulled out his phone. On it, he captured Amy Cooper calling police to report she was being threatened by “an African American man.” In the words of Yogi Berra, it was deja vu all over again for black folks. Cooper was later fired by the investment firm where she worked. The birdwatcher said he felt targeted — just like Ahmaud Arbery, a Black jogger in Georgia. He was killed when a White father and son chased him through their neighborhood and shot him in February. No charges were filed until two months later, after video of the shooting leaked online. On May 29, I awoke to the words of the president of the United States: “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he tweeted, summoning the civil rights era with a phrase used in the 1960s by a Miami police chief and by George Wallace, an aggressive segregationist. If African Americans being killed by police is the throughline of our times, then the drumbeat of aggressions for existing in White spaces is the steady rhythm. No driving while Black. No swimming while Black. No picnicking while Black. No shopping while Black. No standing while Black. No sleeping while Black. No breathing while Black. No being me while Black. And all this while the coronavirus stalks Black bodies, killing us disproportionately. Doctors talk about our illnesses, but they don’t delve into the systemic inequalities that bring them to bear. Being sick while Black is dangerous, too. There is one space where we are welcome: jobs that, during the pandemic, have been deemed essential. We keep subways and buses moving, grocery stores stocked, food delivery services humming while many white-collar workers stay home. And White men hang governors in effigy for not reopening fast enough as African American deaths rise. Barack Obama, the nation’s first and only Black president, tackled what getting back to normal means for African Americans in a statement May 29 about George Floyd’s death. “We have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly ‘normal,’” he said, “whether it’s while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park.” Part of me wants to go off and join the fight. To put aside my journalistic reserve and give full voice to my anger, my disappointment that my country doesn’t always live up to its lofty ideals of equality and justice. To build a brighter future like it seemed on “Star Trek,” where races, nationalities and even species lived together in mutual respect and Lt.

Floyd’s arrest was caught on camera and he could be heard saying “I can’t breathe” while a White officer, Derek Chauvin, held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin was charged May 29 with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.",0.0

(CNS) — Windows of the Cathedral of the Assumption and its offices facing South Fifth Street in downtown Louisville were covered with plywood as a precaution May 30 after a second day of peaceful protests turned to violence and vandalism overnight. Protesters broke three windows in the cathedral rectory — where Archbishop Joseph E. Kurtz and Father Michael Wimsatt, pastor, reside — at about midnight during a May 29 demonstration that began peacefully that afternoon. Those windows also were covered with plywood. In a May 29 letter to Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, Archbishop Kurtz expressed his support of peaceful protests “that give voice to the pain of the community and to the desire for truth and justice to be served.” He also said he lamented the “senseless violence” that developed overnight after peaceful protests had drawn hundreds to downtown Louisville May 28. Louisville protesters joined demonstrators in major cities around the country demanding justice for victims of police violence and racism May 28 and 29. They chanted “No justice, no peace” as they made their way through the streets of the downtown area, stopping periodically to chant and block intersections. In New York City, protesters sprayed graffiti on a portion of two walls and a step at St. Patrick’s Cathedral, according to the New York Post in an evening story May 30. “The graffiti on one wall on Fifth Avenue and 51st Street read ‘F–k F–k’ in red letters,” the Post reported. “On an adjacent wall, vandals scrawled ‘BLM’ — for Black Lives Matter — along with ‘NYPDK’ in red letters and ‘No justice no peace’ in black letters. One of the stairs was spray-painted with ‘George Floyd’ in black letters.” During the May 28 protest in Louisville, shots were fired by a person or persons in the crowd and seven people were wounded, according to the Louisville Metro Police Department. And three protesters were arrested after windows at Metro Department of Corrections properties were broken, according to local news reports. As protests resumed the afternoon of May 29, local leaders called for them to remain peaceful. Late that night and into the early hours of the morning, police in riot gear fogged protesters with tear gas and demonstrators shattered windows of downtown buildings — including the cathedral’s rectory — and looted area stores. Six protesters were arrested and six officers were injured, according to the Louisville Metro Police Department. The protests were sparked by the deaths of Louisville emergency medical worker Breonna Taylor and George Floyd of Minneapolis. A white police officer in Minneapolis has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder manslaughter after being captured on video on Memorial Day kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, an African American, who was arrested on suspicion of forgery, Floyd was pinned to the ground as the officer knelt on his neck for eight minutes. Floyd struggles to say, “I can’t breathe,” repeatedly and eventually appears to lose consciousness or die. He was declared dead at a hospital afterward. Breonna Taylor, 26, was shot to death March 13 by Louisville Metro Police when officers entered her home in plain clothes on a “no-knock warrant,” meaning they could enter her home without identifying themselves or knocking. Thinking they were being robbed, Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired at the officers, The Associated Press reported. Taylor, who was African American, was shot eight times. The FBI is investigating. In response to protests, Louisville Mayor Fischer announced he will temporarily suspend no-knock warrants. The Metro Louisville chief of police has announced his retirement in the wake of the Breonna Taylor shooting. On May 30, the mayor called for a curfew in Jefferson County from 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. He also has called in the Kentucky National Guard. In consultation with the mayor’s office, the Cathedral of the Assumption canceled the Saturday evening Mass for May 30, said Brian B. Reynolds, chancellor and chief administrative officer of the Archdiocese of Louisville. “Archbishop (Kurtz) visited the downtown area this morning. He and the pastor of the cathedral, Father Michael, spoke and assessed the damage done to the residence,” Reynolds said May 30. “Now the priority is to ensure people are safe. The best way is to ensure people aren’t downtown during the curfew.” Reynolds said he has been in touch with pastors in affected neighborhoods and noted, “Churches are considering the best ways to respond to the pastoral needs of their communities.” He added that the archbishop’s May 29 message to the mayor remains unchanged: “Our fellow citizens are suffering and distraught and everyone is on edge due to many factors that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 virus,” Archbishop Kurtz said in his letter to the mayor. “The hope promised by our faith is that the crosses we bear can have a transformative effect as we seek, with God’s grace, to build a better future for all.” “I stand with you as we all work to build a better Louisville in which all citizens thrive and in which there is a shared commitment to the common good.” The letter concluded, “I can assure you that the parishes and faithful of the archdiocese will be praying for you and for a peaceful and just resolution to this situation.” Elsewhere, the archbishop of Atlanta in a May 29 statement decried Floyd’s death and the fatal shooting of Ahmaud Aubrey, 26, in Georgia Feb. 25. He also was an African American and three white men were arrested and face murder charges in his death. “The sin of racism continues to haunt America,” Archbishop Gregory J. Hartmayer said. “In the past month, we have watched two black men die — one of them (Floyd) as he begged for his life. We wake this morning to face the outpouring of grief and rage over the latest manifestations of racism in America. In Atlanta, the birthplace of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., that anger boiled over last night into violence and destruction.” More destruction followed the night of May 29 as hundreds poured into the streets of downtown Atlanta. There was widespread vandalism and property damage, including windows smashed at CNN’s headquarters, and demonstrators clashed with police officers. Protests the next night brought at least 150 arrests. “I call on our Catholic community in Georgia to come together this Pentecost weekend and beyond,” Archbishop Hartmayer said in his statement. “Let us seek out true justice. Let us encounter our neighbors in love and let us join in prayer and work for an end to racism. In the words of Pope St. Paul VI, ‘If you want peace, work for justice.'”",0.0

The day's events began with more than 200 people gathering outside Legislative Hall and the Dover Police Department headquarters. Speakers at city police headquarters stood on the steps of the building's front entrance, calling for better treatment of black men and women by police. Many of those in attendance carried signs held up signs with phrases like ""Black Lives Matter"" or ""We will not be Silenced"" as speakers took turns delivering emotional messages over a megaphone. ""We don't want to fight. We don't want to destroy our city because we need it. We just want to show everybody that we care---that we're here to make things better,"" said DeAndre Valentine, the main organizer of the event. Dover City Councilman Ralph Taylor briefly took up the megaphone and said the men and women of the Dover Police Department were dedicated public servants who treat everyone fairly, but also acknowledged that larger discussions on race and fair treatment could occur between the protesters and city leaders can happen. ""We are not Minneapolis. We do not have these issues. We have good police officers---very good police officers,"" he said in an interview with WBOC. The demonstrations were similar to others that have taken place in cities and towns across the country. They began in Minneapolis following the death of Floyd, who was black, after a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, officials have said. After protesting outside the Dover Police Department, the group moved to Legislative Hall, where people in the crowd took turns calling for fair treatment. Matt Gore, a student at Wesley College, attended the event and said it was important for people to make their voices heard. ""We are getting angry, and frustrated, and tired that we have to put up with these things on a daily basis,"" he said. The crowd then turned its eyes to the road, marching through the streets of Dover, onto U.S. Route 13, and even back to the Dover Police Department, where demonstrators engaged in a dialogue with officers there. But as the evening went on, a crowd made its way up U.S. Route 13 toward the Dover Mall, completely shutting down traffic on the busy roadway at times as the large and loud group of people and cars made their way north. Police met people who gathered in the parking lot of the Dover Mall, which saw a pair of businesses looted. It's unclear how many people involved in the original demonstrations were involved with the group that marched up North DuPont Highway. M/Cpl. Mark Hoffman, a Dover Police Department spokesman, said Forever 21 and a shoe store inside the Dover Mall were broken into. A similar situation at the nearby Cricket Wireless store just south of the mall. Overall on the evening, Hoffman said he was aware of only one person being arrested. He did not immediately have information about charges but said the arrest was made in connection to objects being thrown at police vehicles. Dover police secured the mall shortly after the crowd moved there, but the group made its way north to the area of the Delaware State Police headquarters. By this point in the evening, Dover Mayor Robin Christiansen had announced he had declared a state of emergency and a curfew that went into effect at 9 p.m. Sunday and expired at 6 a.m. Monday. The curfew will continue to be in place for the entire city from 9 p.m.-6 p.m. every day until further notice. ""While it is with every intent we support the First Amendment Right to protest, those rights end when violence and destruction imposes on the rights of their fellow citizens,"" he said. Troopers told the crowd to disperse, though many of the people in the crowd moved across the street to the Capital Inn of Dover. For more than an hour, the group and troopers stood opposite each other before troopers moved back to the northbound side of U.S. Route 13 and the crowd began to disperse.",0.0

A volunteer from the neighborhood walks out onto Lake Street. ""Is this your business?"" she asks. Safia and her daughter Saida Hassan nod silently. ""I'm sorry,"" the woman says. It's the first time they've seen it since fiery protests erupted among cries for racial justice and as state troopers in riot gear blocked the road to this street. The walls are charred black, the kitchen reduced to rubble. Glass and water are swimming in puddles as community members around them work to sweep away the destruction. Safia looks around stunned. Hers is one of hundreds of businesses damaged or destroyed in protests on Thursday and Friday night. ""Alhamdulillah,"" she repeats quietly. Praise God. ""Everyone is safe."" ""My heart is broken. My mind is broken,"" she says. ""I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice."" George Floyd is the African American man who died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee for several minutes last Monday. Protests started in Minneapolis early last week and quickly spread across the country. Floyd's pleading words to the officer, ""I can't breathe,"" are now a rallying cry for people protesting the many black people who have died in police custody. Safia, a Somali immigrant, opened the restaurant in December 2018 with her retirement savings. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, she closed the restaurant and had to choose between paying for insurance and paying staff. So Safia chose her staff. That means there are no funds to rebuild. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family. This weekend, she had planned to reopen as the city started easing stay-at-home orders. She spent over $4,000 on groceries and cleanup. Now that plan is gone. ""It's not just me,"" she says. ""It's all of Lake Street, all of Minneapolis."" Her daughter Saida nods. ""This is a city in pain,"" Saida says. Across the street a row of restaurants — all locally owned, black- and immigrant-owned — are all gone. But the library is OK. In the rubble, Saida finds the sign she made for her mother when the restaurant first opened. Against the black ash the wood plaque is pristine. It reads ""Mama Safia's Kitchen. Seasoned with Love."" ""Because she always cooks with love,"" Saida says. She pulls a few more knickknacks that haven't burned. ""Most of the artifacts here, I got them from Africa,"" she says. ""This one is from Somalia."" She puts them into a tiny pile of what is salvageable. Outside is a tower of all that is lost. Her sister Bibi Abdullah walks in to help. She finds prayer rugs in the banquet room her mom would rent out for small wedding dinners and religious holidays. ""We can still use these,"" she says. ""We just have to wash them."" She searches for more things she can save. ""The truth is things like this happen when people feel powerless. Something has to change,"" Bibi says. Her voice catches. Her body seems to vibrate with a mix of anger and sadness. She says she hopes that these demonstrations translate to voters at the polls come November. ""It came to this because we have people that do not care in positions of power and it should not be that way,"" Bibi says. She and her sister start to clear the big debris together. Then Saida leads her mother, Safia, to the kitchen in the back so they can assess the damage. It's a tunnel of charred walls, ash and debris. Safia gets upset and pulls away, speaking to her daughter in Somali. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" Saida responds in English as her mother walks out. ""She's just saying, 'Why are you bringing me in here? I don't want to see this,' "" Saida says. Saida gets quiet. She stands in the kitchen alone for a moment, staring at the charred walls. Then she joins her family outside where dozens of Minneapolis residents from across the city are working in groups to clear the rubble. With everything unfolding, the pandemic has slipped many people's minds. ""I forgot. Have you seen me shake hands with people?"" Saida shakes her head. ""2020, we hear you, we see you. We went from one crisis to the next. What's next?"" Saida spends every night protesting, but also trying to protect other locally owned stores and restaurants. At night, she cries herself to sleep. She understands the anger and desperation that are leading some to destroy buildings. ""I'm like emotionally torn,"" Saida says. She doesn't want destruction. ""But at the same time, people are crying for help. People are saying, 'Fix this.' "" She says she hopes, from all of this pain, finally there will be change. ",0.0

Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Some health experts have warned that a resurgence in cases could take place if Americans don't adhere to strict social distancing, or take other precautions like wear masks. The White House has also said that cases could go down in the warmer summer months. Does that happen? And if so, do Americans get too comfortable and lapse into a false sense of security — only to see a spike in the fall? None of it's clear, but the U.S. is heading into a period of pandemic experimentation with no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus as yet. 3. Could Steve King lose? Steny Hoyer faces challenge: It's hard to believe, but there are elections on Tuesday. Two of the marquee races deal with well-known — and very different — political figures. Controversial Rep. Steve King, with a history of making racist remarks, is in a fight for his political life with state Sen. Randy Feenstra in Iowa's Republican primary. Conservative groups have lined up against King, but he can't be counted out. This district has a long history of voting for him, despite his pariah status within the party. In Maryland, Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, is facing a primary challenge from the left in 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes, inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's unlikely win in New York over Joe Crowley, a former congressional Democratic leader. Iowa, Maryland and several other states, plus Washington, D.C., hold primaries Tuesday. 4. Biden to get closer to officially clinching nomination: Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is on the ballot Tuesday, too. Remember, he still hasn't acquired the delegates needed to officially put him over the top for the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of doing that. With 500 at stake Tuesday, Biden needs 85% of them Tuesday to clinch. That's unlikely, so look at next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote — with their 133 delegates up for grabs — for Biden to hit the magic number of 1,991. (Follow all the math here with the NPR delegate tracker.) 5. Origins of Trump campaign investigation to be probed: In Congress, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into members of the 2016 Trump campaign. The Senate is also expected to vote on nominations, including for the Treasury Department's inspector general for the pandemic response. And action is possible on changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. Last week, the House, nearly unanimously, passed a bill that reduces the percentage of the loans that businesses have to use toward payroll and gives businesses more time to spend the money and to pay the loans back. Flashback quotation: ""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, 'Please don't be too nice.' When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head]. Like, 'Don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?'

THREE HEALTH IS A GREAT WAY T DO THAT. THREE TELEHEALTH USAGE IS S SKYROCKETING AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEPRESSION, OTHER CONCERNS, OUGHT TO SEEK GUIDANCE. JENNIFER: TH Advertisement National coronavirus updates: Top health officials monitoring nationwide protests in fear of virus spread Share Shares Copy Link Copy The latest:There have been more than 1.9 million coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The U.S. death toll has surpassed 110,000 people, according to Hopkins.The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month.New World Health Organization guidance recommends that fabric masks — which can be homemade — be at least three layers.Health officials have raised concern about coronavirus spread as thousands of people are now braving a pandemic to participate in the national protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday it was closely monitoring the demonstrations taking place across the U.S. and warned such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases.For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said without the lockdowns that most states put in place, that death toll could have been significantly higher.As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out and always maintain a distance.But the large protests make it hard to keep the recommended social distancing guidelines and ""may put others at risk,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.""It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal COVID-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground,"" she said.Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus.""I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,"" he said — especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.So far, more than 1,942,000 people have been infected in the U.S., and at least 110,514 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some states see rise in new casesWhile the early parts of the outbreak in the country hit dense metropolitan areas on the coast the hardest — including California and New York — the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Harris County, Texas, health officials said they identified a nursing home with both cases of the virus and deaths.On Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health said on Twitter. Utah State Rep. Suzanne Harrison called the spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend. ""Please be careful. Practice social distancing. Avoid crowds. Use masks where appropriate. Wash your hands.""Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs — including Arkansas State, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.An important drug could run out Meanwhile, as officials emphasize the U.S. is not yet out of the woods, a government official gave a stark warning. The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir last month. The drug, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola, is now used on hospitalized Covid patients. A study has shown it helps cut down the length of hospital stays.The government has been working to help Gilead ""with some of their supply chain challenges in terms of raw materials and being able to accelerate the process,"" Kadlec said.""Whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,"" he said.",0.0

1622157797,2020-06-01 06:55:01,Federal officials investigating if  extremist groups infiltrated protests,https://www.localdvm.com/news/national/federal-officials-investigating-if-extremist-groups-infiltrated-protests/,en,True,"politics and government, demonstrations and riots",433540,localdvm.com,http://localdvm.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a “very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers.” President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There’s a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it’s not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia.” Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even as he cried he couldn’t breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials.",0.0

Harrison to brief the public on the protests and the status of COVID-19 in Baltimore City. Mayor Young issued the following statement. “Throughout the day Saturday and into the early morning hours of today, we had a number of people engaged in peaceful protests on the streets of Baltimore,” said Mayor Young. “I want to sincerely thank the hundreds of protestors who were peaceful. In Baltimore, your right to peaceful assembly will be protected and you have my word on that. My heart broke watching the pain in our Country play out in the forms of fires set and images of looting. In Baltimore, yesterday, we were a national example of what it looks like to engage in passionate protesting without widespread breaking of the law. I can’t thank the people of our City enough for their courage in the face of continued pain and anger. If you’re coming to Baltimore to protest peacefully, we welcome you but if you’re coming here to throw bricks, break storefront windows or destroy city vehicles, you will be arrested.” Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael S. Harrison added, “While our officers did encounter acts of violence against them, they continued to serve with an unparalleled level of professionalism, tolerance, and restraint. Our contingency plan allowed for resources to be deployed to allow residents to exercise their first amendment rights and we will continue to support those wishing to peacefully protest. 12 Adults and two Juveniles were arrested for unlawful behavior related to the protest. Charges for these arrests include burglary, aggravated assault, attempted arson, and failure to obey a lawful order. We will not allow the actions of a few define those that wish to peaceful protest and exercise their constitutional rights.” Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa added, “The need to use cloth face coverings, to practice social distancing, to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer – these are all critical behaviors key to reducing the spread of COVID-19. We have seen large, crowded gatherings in other cities and countries become “superspreader” events. By taking these precautions, you help reduce the risk that you will become sick, and you help reduce the risk that those around you become sick. In recent weeks, we have experienced positive trends in the data around COVID-19 in Baltimore, showing that we are making strides in stopping transmission and saving lives. We are hopeful, but we must also remain on alert – as we know, COVID-19 can spread easily and rapidly in large groups of people in close proximity for extended periods of time, so we need to continue engaging in behaviors that reduce our risk, and the risk to those around us.” Mayor Young added, “I want to thank the men and women of the Baltimore Police Department for their professionalism and service to our City. Please know that the residents of Baltimore are behind you. I also want to thank Governor Hogan. The City has been working closely with the Maryland State Police and the Governor’s Office. I also want to thank the press for their work and let them know that they will also be protected and allowed to do their jobs. And finally, I want to recognize and thank the many individuals who were part of yesterday’s protests and acted as peacemakers, trying to keep folks calm and who encouraged agitated individuals against throwing things at the police or committing other unlawful acts. You played an important role in keeping the peace yesterday and this City owes you a debt of gratitude.” You can view the entire briefing here.",0.0

The police killing of George Floyd and the civil and political unrest that’s rocked the nation in the week since has the potential to reshape Joe Biden’s vice-presidential selection process. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden’s search for a running mate could be reshaped by the police killing of George Floyd and the unrest it has ignited across the country, raising questions about contenders with law-and-order backgrounds and intensifying pressure on the presumptive Democratic nominee to select a black woman. Biden, who has already pledged to pick a woman, has cast a wide net in his search. Some of the women on his list have drawn national praise amid the protests over Floyd’s death, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who delivered an impassioned appeal for calm in her city on Friday night. But the outcry over police brutality against minorities has complicated the prospects of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a controversial record addressing police violence as a prosecutor in the city where Floyd died. Biden’s choice of a running mate will be among the most consequential decisions he makes in the campaign, particularly given that the 77-year-old is already talking about himself as a “transition” candidate to a new generation of Democratic leaders. His pick will also be viewed as a signal both of his values and who he believes should have representation at the highest level of the American government. Even before the outcry over Floyd’s death, some Biden allies were already urging him to put a black woman on the ticket given the critical role African Americans played in his path to the Democratic nomination. Those calls have gotten louder in recent days. “The more we see this level of hatred, the more I think it’s important to confront it with symbolic acts, including potentially the selection of an African American woman as vice president,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and one of the labor leaders who’s been asked for input by Biden’s team on the selection process. Bottoms is one of several black women under consideration by Biden’s campaign. Others Biden is believed to be considering include California Sen. Kamala Harris, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and voting rights activist. Demings didn’t answer directly when asked if the events of the past week increased pressure on Biden to choose a black woman in an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday. “Well, we’ve never seen a black woman selected as a vice presidential candidate. But I think the American people want someone who cares about their issues and are willing to move the ball forward,” Asked if she believes race should be left out of the conversation, she was careful to defer to Biden. “It doesn’t really matter what I think,” she said. “What matters is what Americans think, and what Joe Biden thinks.” Demings, a former Orlando police chief, wrote a high-profile editorial on Friday challenging her former colleagues in law enforcement. “As a former woman in blue, let me begin with my brothers and sisters in blue: What in the hell are you doing?” Demings wrote in The Washington Post. Politicians with law-and-order backgrounds have been viewed skeptically by some in the Democratic Party given the high-profile instances of police brutality against minorities and other inequities in the criminal justice system. In an interview Sunday, Demings defended herself and other potential contenders with such backgrounds, declaring “you’re either gonna be part of the problem or part of the solution.” “And I think the community wants people who understand the system from the inside out in order to bring real life necessary reforms,” she said. Harris faced criticism throughout her Democratic primary campaign for her record as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, when she resisted reforms that would have required her office to investigate killings by police and established statewide standards for body cameras. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested a resume as a prosecutor could be problematic for potential contenders. “Prosecutors are not very popular, especially among young people now,” he said. “I’ve got a granddaughter who is graduating from law school and she wants to be a public defender. She doesn’t want to be a prosecutor. And I think a lot of younger people feel the same.” Klobuchar, who also sought the Democratic nomination, has faced questions about her eight years as prosecutor for Minnesota’s largest county during the primary. Most of the more than two dozen people who died during police encounters in her tenure were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of those past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday with Floyd’s murder. Since ending her campaign, Klobuchar has emerged as a key Biden surrogate and some Democrats see her as a running mate who could help him appeal to some of the white, working-class voters who turned against the party in the 2016 election. Yet some Democrats say the renewed focus on police brutality could complicate her path. “This is very tough timing for her,” said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a top Biden ally. Klobuchar has said that she is confident Biden will make the right choice and that she’s not thinking about politics right now. Biden has said he will announce a running mate by Aug. 1, a timeline that leaves plenty of time for the national mood to shift again, particularly as the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic collapse pressed on. Those twin crises have already led to increased scrutiny for others in the mix to become Biden’s running mate. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a frequent Trump target during the pandemic for her resistance to lifting stay at home orders, faced questions after her husband allegedly tried to skip the line with a dock company and get his boat in the water ahead of other patrons over Memorial Day weekend. And Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico was criticized by Republicans in her state following a report that she purchased jewelry from a local business just days after she ordered non-essential businesses to shut down and told residents to stay home. Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who was vetted as a potential vice presidential pick in 2004, said the scrutiny contenders are facing now has “proliferated.” “The scrutiny compared to when I was vetted is so much more intense and potentially troublesome for a VP candidate,” he said. Biden’s search process is still in a relatively early phase. A search committee has been meeting with power players on the left, with special attention to Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill and across organized labor. Biden, who has largely been cloistered at his home in Delaware during the pandemic, would also like to conduct in person meetings with finalists. “It’s important for him to see the candidate, talk to the candidate, get body language from the candidate. And I don’t mean one time. I think it needs to be several times,” said Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana congressman and campaign co-chair. __ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

Viewer discretion is advised. ATLANTA (WSAV) — Atlanta’s mayor says two city police investigators have been fired and three officers are on desk duty following an arrest Saturday involving two college students. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said the police used excessive force while arresting Messiah Young and Taniyah Pilgrim, students at Morehouse College and Spelman College respectively. The investigators, identified as Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter, were part of the Atlanta Police Department’s (APD) Fugitive Unit. On Saturday, they were assisting with civil disturbances in the city when the incident involving Young and Pilgrim occurred. Gardner served APD for 22 years and Streeter had been with the department since 2003. Investigator Mark Gardner (Atlanta Police Department) Investigator Ivory Streeter (Atlanta Police Department) Video of the incident, that first gained attention online and on local news, shows a group of police officers in riot gear and gas masks surrounding a car being driven by the students. The officers pulled Pilgrim out of the vehicle and appeared to use a stun gun on the vehicle’s occupants. The two students did not appear to be fighting the police. Bottoms said Pilgrim was released without charges. She also said she was ordering the charges against Young be dropped. The mayor said she and APD Chief Erika Shields made the decision to fire the officers after reviewing body-camera footage. “Use of excessive force is never acceptable,” Bottoms told reporters Sunday. Shields called the footage “really shocking to watch” and apologized to the students. Saturday night, more than 150 people were arrested for various violations during the protest, according to the mayor. Shields praised other officers, many who are having knives and rocks thrown at them. One is in intensive care following a collision with an ATV. The city remains under a curfew from 9 p.m. until Monday morning. Bottoms said it may be extended.",0.0

City leaders had pleaded for calm Saturday, seeking to avoid the violence that pervaded protests in the city five years ago in response to the in-custody death of Freddie Gray. The city largely avoided the large-scale violence that gripped some other cities across the nation, though some buildings downtown were damaged and fires were set Saturday. “We were a national example of what it looks like to engage in passionate protesting without widespread breaking of the law,” said Baltimore Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young at a Sunday news briefing. Still, there were issues. Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said 12 adults and two juveniles were arrested Saturday night on charges including burglary and attempting arson. He also said police would step up to protect reporters and investigate an assault on a TV crew from WBFF-TV, the city's Fox affiliate, in which reporters were pushed, chased and had some of the equipment stolen and destroyed. At City Hall, where police formed a protective barricade, someone flung a shopping cart at officers in the barricade. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN's “State of the Union” that Baltimore's experience from the Freddie Gray protests shows the importance of allowing peaceful protest while stepping in quickly to deter violence. “Our theory was kind of peace through strength. We did not let it escalate to violence, where crowds were overpowering police,” he said. “But we separated the violent acts and the destructive acts from the peaceful protesting. And we tried to get in there and communicate with the citizens.” Hogan, a Republican, said it's important to not to exacerbate the situation with inflammatory rhetoric, and he criticized President Donald Trump for saying on Twitter that looting would be met with shooting. “That’s not helpful. It’s not lowering the temperature,” Hogan said. “It’s sort of continuing to escalate the rhetoric. And I think it’s just the opposite of the message that should have been coming out of the White House.” Baltimore was just one of many cities across the country that saw protests in response to Floyd's death. Floyd’s arrest was caught on camera and he could be heard saying “I can’t breathe” while a white officer, Derek Chauvin, held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.",0.0

I POSTED LINKS TO AL Advertisement How to talk to your children about protests and racism Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video may contain images that are offensive. Viewer discretion is advised.As cities and social media explode with anger over the killing of yet another black man at the hands of police, worried parents struggle with how to protect their children from seeing the worst of the violence while simultaneously explaining the ravages of racism.It couldn't have come at a worse time.Sheltering at home for months to avoid the deadly coronavirus, many parents stressed by juggling work and child care from home had eased their restrictions on screen time for their children.Now it's even more likely that kids might find the video of George Floyd, an unarmed and handcuffed black man in Minneapolis, gasping for breath as a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck.Even if they haven't, experts say parents should assume their children are already aware of tragedies like these and their aftermath.""Children and adolescents are experiencing the collateral consequences of the publicized murderers of Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and George Floyd, whether they have a smartphone in their direct possession or not,"" said California pediatrician Dr. Rhea Boyd, who teaches nationally on the relationship between structural racism, inequity and health.""Whether from social media accounts, conversations with peers or caregivers, overheard conversations, or the distress they witness in the faces of those they love, children know what is going on,"" Boyd said. ""And without the guidance and validation of their caregivers, they may be navigating their feelings alone.""Take care of you firstHow can a parent help their child traverse these disturbing times?Let the child's age and level of development guide you, experts say, but first, be sure that you are in the right frame of mind.""A parent's first step is to take care of themselves, their mental health, their emotional health. Put their oxygen mask on first before they put the oxygen mask on their child,"" said Chicago pediatrician Dr. Nia Heard-Garris, who chairs the minority health, equity and inclusion committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).""Vicarious trauma through screens is real, especially for marginalized communities who may have experienced similar actions first-hand,"" said Dr. Jenny Radesky, a developmental behavioral pediatrician who teaches at the University of Michigan.The stress of watching traumatic events on television and smartphones ""lingers within our bodies and minds,"" Radesky added. She suggests parents find ways to channel that energy with positive actions, such as deep breathing and re-grounding exercises, before playing with or talking to your kids.""This doesn't mean letting go of the anger or anxiety, it just means organizing it better so you can think and act more clearly,"" she said.Once a parent is fully available to be a calm, rational voice, ""then you can parse out what's important to pass onto your child so that you're not oversharing information that may further traumatize them or make them feel insecure or unsafe,"" Heard-Garris said.Infants and toddlersWhile children younger than three aren't going to understand what is happening on television, they will be able to pick up on the ""fear, urgency, or anger in people's voices and behaviors,"" Radesky said.At this age, stress shows up in fussy or unregulated behavior. To keep that from occurring, parents should read, listen to or watch the news when the baby isn't physically there.""Watch what you need to stay informed about your community, but then turn it off and do something that makes your family feel connected and whole,"" Radesky said. ""You may need to re-ground yourself or regulate your thoughts and feelings before re-engaging with your kids.""This is the time to begin teaching your child about systemic racism and how to identify and refute it, experts say.Racist stereotypes and bias begin at a shockingly young age.As early as six months, a baby's brain can notice race-based differences, and can internalize racial bias by ages two to four, said Maryland pediatrician Dr. Jacqueline Dougé, who co-authored the AAP's statement on the impact of racism on child and adolescent health.""Learning"" racism is a lot like learning a new language for babies and toddlers, wrote Dougé and California pediatrician Dr. Ashaunta Anderson in a separate commentary. It can happen without parental input, just by the racial stereotypes so prevalent in society.By age 12, many children become set in their beliefs. That gives parents ""a decade to mold the learning process, so that it decreases racial bias and improves cultural understanding,"" they wrote.While helpful for all races, it's especially important for white children to see brown and black kids in a positive light to fight systemic racism, experts say. Books that profile multi-racial characters are an excellent way for parents to do that. And since it's never too early to read to a baby, start right away.Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that rates movies, TV shows, books, apps and other media for parents and schools, has curated a list of 80 books with diverse, multi-cultural characters for preschoolers and older, some of which could easily be suitable for babies and toddlers.""There's also a website called the Brown Bookshelf,"" said Heard-Garris. ""These are books that have, brown and black protagonists who deal at times with tough issues. I think books are really, really fundamental, especially for younger kids.""Preschool and elementary agesThis is the age when kids begin to ask questions on why other people look different than they do.""If your child asks about someone's skin tone, you might say, 'Isn't it wonderful that we are all so different!' You can even hold your arm against theirs to show the differences in skin tones in your family,"" according to Dougé and Anderson.At this age, children will see and absorb disturbing images from protests and riots literally, ""likely focusing on worrying about a burning van or a scary-looking person in a mask,"" Radesky said.Parents should do their best to limit the exposure children this age have to media, whether television, smart phones or tablets, experts say.""This can be done by setting certain times that children can use their devices, co-view the content with their children, find other activities like playing outside, games, cooking together, set rules that kids should use the devices in a common area where parents can check in,"" Dougé said.""These times also provide opportunities for parents to model the behavior they want their kids to follow by also limiting their exposure to media,"" Dougé added.But as Boyd said, children will likely have already overheard adult conversations, or been exposed to what is happening via social media accounts and conversations with friends.""Parents who have not already, should proactively engage their kids around these distressing events,"" Boyd said. ""Ask them what they know and what they've seen. Ask them how they are feeling. Validate their feelings and let them know what you are doing to keep them safe -- be it in your home or your community.""Parents will also need to give their children the broader societal context of racism in order to try to explain the rage of protestors filling the streets of cities across the nation, Radesky said.By doing so, parents can help build empathy and teach perspective-taking, rather than focusing on the child's specific fears.""Instead of focusing on questions the child may have about concrete things, ask them questions like 'How do you think those people were feeling? Do you know why they were angry? What do you do when you feel like something is unfair?' "" Radesky said.""Providing a controlled space to understand what is going on and ways to process it will help children navigate the distressing emotions, helplessness and fear they may be experiencing,"" Boyd said.Age-appropriate books that deal with discrimination and explain feelings from different perspectives are extremely helpful during this time, experts say.""You can also show them videos of peaceful protests from the past, where people were inspired to demand fair treatment,"" said Radesky, while warning that some YouTube videos can contain intense political and disinformation ads occurring before and during videos.""Just skip those and start showing your young kids the Martin Luther King Jr. or other video once the ad has passed,"" Radesky suggested. ""For older children, you can ask them what they think of different ads and whether they're trustworthy.""'The talk'For black families, there is another, more painful necessity at this age, known as ""the talk."" It's a series of ""don'ts"" black families have passed on for generations: Don't resist police. Stay away from bad places. Be respectful to white people and stay away from confrontation with white men, especially police.""We're black folks, so we don't have a choice but to talk about race and talk about racism,"" said Heard-Garris, who has a 7-year-old son. ""So he can tell you probably more eloquently than I can about racism and he's seven.""She recalls with pain when he asked her if he would be the target of police violence at the tender age of four after he heard adults talk about a recent police shooting of an unarmed black man.""He said to me, 'Are police here to help me or do they shoot me? I thought they're supposed to keep me safe. I thought they were supposed to keep us safe.' And he was four,"" she related.""And so we had a long conversation about how police are supposed to keep us safe, and I assured him that as his mom, that's my job. 'My first job is to always keep you safe,' I told him.""""As he grows, I'm going to have to have a more frank conversation that, 'Unfortunately, you're going to do all the right things, but you might not be safe."" And that's going to be a hard day for us.""The recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, an EMT who was killed in March after officers forced their way inside her home; Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old unarmed black man shot while taking a jog in rural Georgia in February; and now George Floyd's death, has many black parents afraid that ""the talk"" may not be enough.""The problem here is systemic racism and disregard for black lives,"" Heard-Garris said. ""And so as a doctor, I don't just treat a patient that has a fever when they have a bacterial infection, right?""I give them antibiotics. I don't just keep giving them Tylenol because that's not going to treat the infection. And I think as a country we need to treat the illness, which is systemic racism.""As Heard-Garris's story illustrates, when to begin ""the talk"" will be unique for each child and family, Boyd said.""For some, it may be earlier than expected, because evidence indicates black children in particular are often perceived as older and less innocent than they are. For black girls, this process of adultification can begin as young as age 5, and for black boys, it can begin by age 10,"" Boyd said.""Beginning 'the talk' with school-aged children can prepare them for these encounters before they occur and equip them with tools that can be life saving,"" Boyd added.As an African-American pediatrician, Boyd discusses the topic often with parents of children in her care. She advises black parents to think of ""the talk"" as more of a process than a singular conversation.""That process may begin with introducing stories through age-appropriate books or films that can generate questions you answer together. Or it can be an ongoing dialogue that is sparked by current events. Just remember to include specific guidance that enables your child to know their rights and the steps they can take to try and stay safe. And always be sure to let your child know it isn't fair they have to learn these lessons so young. But you are teaching then to try to keep them safe,"" Boyd said.White parents can have ""the talk"" too, Boyd said.""It's an important moment to build empathy with your child,"" she said. ""It is also important to highlight the other children who may have fears or concerns related to their safety, and to model and practice 'upstanding' or acting in defense of those around them.""Tweens and teensOf course, tweens and teens will likely be seeing all the coverage of police brutality and protests on their personal smartphones. Most teens get comfort by communicating with their friends on social media, Heard-Garris said. Some teens have even begun participating in online activism.""Online activism is a coping response for some adolescents, especially right now while we're physically distant,"" Heard-Garris said. ""Reposting, retweeting, expressing how they're feeling, chatting with friends has been helpful, sort of an active kind of coping response.""Other teens, especially those that are not of a minority background, so those that are white, are educating themselves about why this is happening, what's the history of our country, what's happening right now. Intellectualizing the issues has been helpful for them to understand this is not just a today problem, this has been going on for years,'"" Heard-Garris said.At this age, kids will be able to think more abstractly about racism, injustice and violent versus peaceful protest and discuss their views with parents, experts say.""Parents can ask their tweens or teens whether they've seen anything online about the riots and protests, what they think, and what about it was upsetting or inspiring,"" Radesky said.As the parent of any teenager will attest, direct questioning of teens often doesn't produce constructive responses.""I dunno,"" is a typical reaction, so Radesky suggests parents also try asking about the types of unfairness kids see or feel in their everyday lives.Parents can also make good use of movies and documentaries that can educate older teens on the history of discrimination. Common Sense Media has lists of movies that discuss racism or inspire kids to ""change the world,"" which can be used to jump start conversations about racism and how they can help fight it, Radesky said.""You don't need to preach to children about what is 'right' or 'wrong,'"" she said. ""It's better to have a conversation where they come to their own understanding and can see things in a larger social context.""Kira Banks, a clinical psychologist whose website ""Raising Equity"" provides free videos and resources on how parents can fight racism and cultivate an open mind in themselves and their kids, suggests parents watch movies like ""13th,"" a powerful look at institutional racism in the justice system that premiered in 2016 to a standing ovation at the New York Film Festival.""Is this a teachable moment? Absolutely. It must be, it has to be,"" Banks said. ""And if a person hasn't done the work to understand the history of racism and discrimination in America, they should do so, and then join us in raising our children to see and disrupt racism, and be the change we want to see.""The work must be done by all social classes and races, experts say, including the most privileged.""White and non-black families should not shield their older children from these images,"" Radesky said. ""We need to engage our children in a conversation about racism, and use these events as a catalyst.""While it is upsetting to watch, we need to sit with that discomfort and teach our families how to channel that energy to work to dismantle the racist structures that exist in our communities.""",0.0

But after another night of violent protests, the 77-year-old Democrat gathered with roughly a dozen local black leaders during an intimate meeting in his hometown ahead of a virtual meeting with mayors from Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Paul, Minnesota.  That low-key, high-touch approach marked a sharp contrast to that of Trump in recent days, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president was scheduled to speak to governors and law enforcement officials on Monday, but he spent much of the weekend using Twitter as a bullhorn to urge “law and order” and tougher action by police against protesters around the country. He warned Friday that, “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”  Trump also lashed out at Biden Monday, tweeting that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.”  In the early moments of Monday's gathering at the Bethel AME church in Biden's hometown of Wilmington, the former vice president listened quietly and took notes in a spiral notebook. All of the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks.  “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” said Pastor Sylvester Beaman, before Biden and those present bowed their heads in prayer.  Biden's softer approach may foreshadow how the presumptive Democratic nominee presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by the much louder, more persistent voice of Trump.  “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.”  Reassurance requires presence, though, and that has been a hurdle for the former vice president, driven inside by the coronavirus pandemic, still working to adapt to the power of social media as a substitute and without the natural platform of a public office.  Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden.  Monday marked just his third public appearance since the pandemic exploded in mid-March.  Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veteran’s memorial near his Wilmington home last week, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in another part of the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd.  “The only way to bear this pain is to turn all that anguish to purpose,” Biden wrote in a message attached to the Sunday photo. “And as President, I will help lead this conversation - and more importantly, I will listen.”  Monday morning's gathering featured 15 invited religious, political and educational leaders, including Delaware Democratic Rep. Blunt Rochester. They all wore masks and spaced out among the wooden pews. Pasted notices on the main entrance cautioned people from entering if they had a cough or other symptoms that could indicate they were suffering from coronavirus.  Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He's called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension.  Democrats believe the former vice president draws a contrast with Trump in such moments that works in his favor. They note that while Biden didn't appear on television all weekend, he spoke about Floyd's death before Trump addressed it and has shown compassion for the protesters. Trump has alternated between expressing alarm over Floyd's death and sympathy for his family and issuing tweets antagonizing protesters and disparaging his political enemies.  And in an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in.  Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. And some Democrats who have criticized Biden in the past for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now.  “I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”",0.0

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets across America again Sunday, with peaceful demonstrations against police killings of black people overshadowed by unrest that ravaged cities from Philadelphia to Los Angeles and flared near the White House. City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters’ movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry — boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. VIDEO: Protests, tear gas and fires in Washington, DC   A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. “They keep killing our people,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. “I’m so sick and tired of it.” But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it “really shocking to watch.” In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd’s neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” Among in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said. ___ Morrison and Sullivan reported from Minneapolis.

(AP) — Maryland lawmakers on Saturday announced a group of legislators to address issues concerning police accountability. The interim workgroup will start meeting this summer and make recommendations for next year’s legislative session. “Policing in America is broken. While we have taken a number of positive steps in Maryland, we can’t be satisfied until every citizen has confidence in their police department,” said House Speaker Adrienne Jones, who is the first black and female House speaker in Maryland. “As the mother of two sons, accountability in policing is not just philosophical, it is personal.” Del. Luke Clippinger, a Baltimore Democrat who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said Maryland has done important work on the issue in the last several years, but it’s not enough. “We are seeing record levels of crime in Baltimore City, at the same time that the Baltimore Police Department is under a federal consent decree,” Clippinger said. “I am hoping to see recommendations for tangible reform that restores trust and helps communities build real relationships with the law enforcement that serve them.” Baltimore entered into its consent decree after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray following an injury while in police custody, which caused unrest in the city five years ago. A measure to improve disclosure of police records passed Clippinger’s committee in the last session, but lawmakers adjourned early due to the coronavirus before the bill could advance further. Del. Vanessa Atterbeary, a Howard County Democrat, will chair the workgroup. “The events around the country this week have underscored that we cannot wait another day,” Atterbeary said. “We need structural reform ideas from the community and law enforcement to fix this problem in a collaborative way.” Protests have been taken place in cities around the country following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd, an African American, died after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The officer was fired from the department and faces criminal charges. The Maryland panel will review policies and procedures related to the investigations of police misconduct. It also will examine the viability of uniform statewide use of force policies and arrest procedures and review the use of body cameras and the disclosure of camera footage. It also will identify national best practices of independent prosecution of law-enforcement related crimes. Maryland’s Commission to Restore Trust in Policing is set to complete its work at the end of the year after focusing for two years on reforms to the Baltimore City Police Department after a specialized gun-recovery unit made up of rogue detectives was brought down in a far-reaching federal investigation. ___",0.0

Floyd died after since-fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for over eight minutes. Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. People across the country have taken to the streets to vent their frustrations over the seeming lack of value for the lives of black men. It was the same week the nation crossed the 100,000 death count from coronavirus. Sunday alone saw an increase of almost 20,000 cases, according to the CNN count compiled with data from John's Hopkins. As of Monday morning at least 1,790,191 Americans have contracted the virus and 104,383 have died. But some expect a jump in cases following days of demonstrations. Spike in cases expected With large groups of people out in hoards close together during the protests, Minnesota Governor Walz said he expects a sharp increase in cases of COVID-19 in his state ""I am deeply concerned about a super-spreader type of incident,"" Walz said. ""We're going to see a spike in COVID-19. It's inevitable."" Officials in New York shared the governor's worry about a potential for rise in coronavirus among protesters. ""I would still wish that everyone would realize that when people gather it's inherently dangerous in the context of this pandemic, and I'm going to keep urging people not to use that approach and if they do they focus on social distancing and wearing face coverings,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Saturday. The mayor said he recognized the need to demonstrate following the death of Floyd but, ""It's a very, very complicated reality."" ""You cannot see overt racism, you cannot see overt racist murder and not feel something profoundly deep, so I understand that,"" de Blasio added. ""But the last thing we would want to see is members of our community harmed because the virus spread in one of these settings."" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that while people have the right to protest, even during a pandemic, they also have a duty to protect the health of themselves and others. ""You have a right to demonstrate you have a right to protest, God Bless America,"" Cuomo said at a Saturday press conference. ""You don't have a right to infect other people, you don't have a right to act in a way that's going to jeopardize public health."" ""Demonstrate with a mask on,"" he said nodding to its effectiveness. ""You're wrong not to wear a mask, I think you're disrespectful, I think you're putting other people's lives at risk needlessly."" Cuomo also noted how the coronavirus has brought long standing health disparities for the African American community to light once again. ""The coronavirus crisis has created a depth of pain that still has not been accounted for. So many New Yorkers have lost someone but that is particularly true in communities of color and particularly true in the African American community,"" Cuomo said. ""That loss is being felt so deeply because every knows it's not based on equality ... communities of color lost so much more."" Protests taking focus off pandemic Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms also said she's worried about the impact the virus is having on the community during the protests. She told CNN she's been so busy with ongoing unrest in her city that she neglected to look at infection data for days. ""Last night I realized I hadn't looked at our coronavirus numbers in two days,"" Lance Bottoms told CNN's Jake Tapper during State of the Union. ""That's frightening because it's a pandemic and people of color are getting hit harder."" ""I am extremely concerned when we're seeing mass gatherings. We know what's happening in our community with this virus,"" the mayor explained. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan shared a similar sentiment saying the priority has been to keep people safe during the demonstrations, but the focus has to also include the months long fight against the spread of coronavirus. Speaking to Jake Tapper on State of the Union, Hogan said he, too, is concerned about the coronavirus amidst the fallout from the death of Floyd. ""There's no questions that when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity when we've got this virus all over the streets is not healthy,"" Hogan said. ""Two weeks from now across America we're going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up."" ""Most states had rules about no crowds of ten or more and now we're seeing thousands of people jammed in together in close proximity,"" Hogan added. Health experts worried about spread Health experts have also spoken out about the need for masks and other protective measures in light of racial disparities in the data showing minorities have an increased risk for catching the virus. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under President Donald Trump, said during CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday that these demonstrations will create further spread of COVID-19, especially in a state that was trending upward before this week's events. ""There's going to be a lot of issues coming out of what's happened in the last week, but one of them is going to be that chains of transmission will have become lit from these gatherings,"" Gottlieb said. ""And Minnesota, one of the hard hit states by the protests where you've seen large mass gatherings, that state has been seeing an uptick in cases to begin with. Even before these protests started, we saw rising hospitalizations in that state."" Other doctors told CNN that the racial disparity in the way coronavirus spreads will only be compounded by the protests. ""I think this week, more than any week, it is so important to call attention to the racial disparities that many of us in the public health community, John, have been talking about for months,"" Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency room physician and researcher at Brown University, told CNN's John King. ""We know that blacks are two to four times more likely to die from Covid-19 compared to whites. And of course, other communities, like Native Americans and Hispanics, are disproportionately affected, as well. ""It's so tied up with our country's history of structural racism, historical injustices, as well as ongoing problems,"" Dr. Ranny noted. Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of Harvard's Global Health Institute, said on the same show that he wished demonstrators would wear masks to protect themselves and others. ----------------------------",0.0

Saturday, May 30, thousands came together in protest, closing the L.A. streets from Fairfax all the way through 3rd street, is the aftermath from the current murder of George Floyd by police hand in Minneapolis. Garcetti reiterated what he said yesterday, acknowledging the injustice of police brutality within the Black Community and pleaded with all residents to keep a level head while fighting for peace. Yesterday Mayor Garcetti responded to the devastating news of George Floyd by stating, “…He was far from the first, the end of his life, was another page in the worst chapter of our nation’s history of what it means to be black in America. 244 years into our attempts to define a more perfect union and each time this happens we have to speak clearly. We have to say the truth. We have to stop in these moments as painful as they are, to right the wrongs that aren’t just part of our history but exist here in our presence.” The mayor reflected on the Rodney King case, considering the riots and fires that came from the rage of a man being captured on film being horrendously beaten by policemen in Los Angeles. Garcetti stated today he wanted to speak very personally to all Angelenos, “My first responsibility to you is to protect life and liberty, and to speak the truth so when we see a horrific murder like what we seen on the streets of Minneapolis, which joined too many murders,” Garcetti continued, “We know all of us cry out, if you have truth and justice in your heart if you love anywhere in your soul, that this wrong and we all want to make it right.” The mayor went on to discuss the meaning of liberty is a shared responsibility, to ensure safety for all those who are fighting for justice. Garcetti emphasized that the fight should be peacefully protested, to adjust the world with organized structure. The mayor stressed the fears of changing the world for the better will slip away due to the more violent side of protesting. Looting, setting fires, and uncontrollable chaos will regress any progress made in COVID-19 recovery, testing sites had to close down today for safety measures. It endangers the emergency first responders, who are already stretched thin due to the viral pandemic. The mayor asked everyone to take a step back for a moment, to let the fire fighters put out the fires and allow “peace officers” to restore order. Garcetti agreed there needs to be a reckoning for the murder committed, he declared that there should be a demand for justice, but one that does not put people’s lives in danger. Garcetti declared that violence within protest is a disservice to the cause of the fight. Council Member Curren Price joined the mayor and stated, “ We are all leaders, in times like this we all have a chance and responsibility to step up to the plate, do what we can to move forward in a positive way.” Price acknowledge the need for protest and to express concerns in times of injustice, but he shared that it comes with a level of responsibility. The council member explained the destruction of property and threatening life does not translate the reason for the call of justice. The mayor went on to highlight other unjust murders prior to Floyd’s death to emphasize the point of action that needs to take place. He called for the help of “Non-African Americans” to rally behind the fight for equality and justice, to end police brutality. He spoke “all” owning this moment and “all” must join this movement. Later that night a protest rose to violent levels with over 300 people arrested and a number of policemen injured. Looting and miscellaneous crimes were committed amid downtown Los Angeles. Garcetti announced a curfew across Los Angeles that’s starts at 8pm to 5:30 am, and there is talk of the mayor putting the National Guard on alert.

Yesterday Mayor Garcetti responded to the devastating news of George Floyd by stating, “…He was far from the first, the end of his life, was another page in the worst chapter of our nation’s history of what it means to be black in America. 244 years into our attempts to define a more perfect union and each time this happens we have to speak clearly. We have to say the truth. We have to stop in these moments as painful as they are, to right the wrongs that aren’t just part of our history but exist here in our presence.” The mayor reflected on the Rodney King case, considering the riots and fires that came from the rage of a man being captured on film being horrendously beaten by policemen in Los Angeles. Garcetti stated today he wanted to speak very personally to all Angelenos, “My first responsibility to you is to protect life and liberty, and to speak the truth so when we see a horrific murder like what we seen on the streets of Minneapolis, which joined too many murders,” Garcetti continued, “We know all of us cry out, if you have truth and justice in your heart if you love anywhere in your soul, that this wrong and we all want to make it right.” The mayor went on to discuss the meaning of liberty is a shared responsibility, to ensure safety for all those who are fighting for justice. Garcetti emphasized that the fight should be peacefully protested, to adjust the world with organized structure. The mayor stressed the fears of changing the world for the better will slip away due to the more violent side of protesting. Looting, setting fires, and uncontrollable chaos will regress any progress made in COVID-19 recovery, testing sites had to close down today for safety measures. It endangers the emergency first responders, who are already stretched thin due to the viral pandemic. The mayor asked everyone to take a step back for a moment, to let the fire fighters put out the fires and allow “peace officers” to restore order. Garcetti agreed there needs to be a reckoning for the murder committed, he declared that there should be a demand for justice, but one that does not put people’s lives in danger. Garcetti declared that violence within protest is a disservice to the cause of the fight. Council Member Curren Price joined the mayor and stated, “ We are all leaders, in times like this we all have a chance and responsibility to step up to the plate, do what we can to move forward in a positive way.” Price acknowledge the need for protest and to express concerns in times of injustice, but he shared that it comes with a level of responsibility. The council member explained the destruction of property and threatening life does not translate the reason for the call of justice. The mayor went on to highlight other unjust murders prior to Floyd’s death to emphasize the point of action that needs to take place. He called for the help of “Non-African Americans” to rally behind the fight for equality and justice, to end police brutality. He spoke “all” owning this moment and “all” must join this movement. Later that night a protest rose to violent levels with over 300 people arrested and a number of policemen injured. Looting and miscellaneous crimes were committed amid downtown Los Angeles. Garcetti announced a curfew across Los Angeles that’s starts at 8pm to 5:30 am, and there is talk of the mayor putting the National Guard on alert.

Wait, I get it. The nationwide calls for justice, as Floyd's death was ruled, a homicide by both the Hennepin County Medical examiner and in an independent autopsy authorized by the family. The autopsy shows that Mr Floyd had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death. Cause of death, in my opinion, is that's fix CIA due to compression of the neck. But the Hennepin County medical examiner released its summary, saying Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest without explaining what caused his heart to stop overnight curfews enforced in cities in at least 20 states in Washington, D. C. And many stayed out late into the night instead of going home. Protests were largely peaceful across the nation and that some marches policed even joining the people in solidarity like in Atlanta, where some officers were seen taking a knee before renewed violence. But unrest and clashes between authorities and demonstrators were on display in many cities. Police firing tear gas into this crowd of protesters in Philadelphia, sending them scrambling off the highway. In Washington, a chaotic scene as police cleared this peaceful protest outside the White House has thousands of demonstrators marched together in New York City. Others looted some of midtown Manhattan's most iconic stores. Similar scenes playing out in Los Angeles with businesses broken into. Earlier in Minneapolis, Terrence Floyd for the first time visiting the very location, his brother took his last breaths, overwhelmed with emotion before saying this to Demonstrators. If I'm not over here wiling out, I'm not over here, woman up stuff. If I'm not only messing up my community, no, what you are doing, What are you doing?

Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard.Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.People marched in groups of thousands in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, as merchants boarded up their businesses. As the the curfew time arrived, many were still in the streets and continued marching, with officers initially standing by and allowing them.But officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them.“Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change.MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is taking over the prosecution in George Floyd's death, said Monday night that he will ""hold everyone accountable.""""I can assure you we are taking a fresh look,"" Ellison told CNN. ""We plan to hold everyone accountable who is legally culpable,"" he said, explaining that while he has spent the last 24 hours reviewing evidence, he cannot ethically comment as a prosecutor.""We are looking very carefully at holding everybody accountable who failed to do their duty and fell below the legal requirements of their position, or did something affirmatively that would be in violation of the law,"" Ellison said.""When we are ready, and that won't be long from now, we plan on taking the proper and deliberate action,"" he said.He said earlier in the day that he'd move as ""quickly and effectively"" as possible.""I need to protect this prosecution,"" he told CNN. ""I am not going to create a situation where people can say this was a rush to judgment.""On Sunday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced that Ellison, the former congressman who ran for chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, will take the lead in the case of Floyd's killing.WASHINGTON D.C. — The U.S. Park Police is denying it used tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters outside the White House on Monday night, saying officers instead used smoke canisters and pepper balls to aggressively push back the demonstrators.Protesters scrambled as smoke filled the streets and AP journalists witnessed people reacting to their eyes and throats becoming irritated. Journalists covering the protest reported the crowd was largely peaceful at the time; the Park Police said they were responding to protesters throwing items, including bricks and frozen water bottles at law enforcement.Justice Department officials offered a different explanation, saying officers were carrying out Attorney General William Barr’s order to expand the security perimeter outside the White House.Officers repelled the crowd nearly 30 minutes ahead of a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington. Shortly after the crowd was pushed back, President Donald Trump walked through the park where they had gathered for a photo opportunity at a nearby church.--------------Hundreds of people were gathered peacefully tonight at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. — a mix of black and white, young and old, looked out toward the Washington Monument.Several dozen uniformed guardsmen and women, along with Park Police, were standing on the steps of the monument.There were speakers and prayers and signs, calling for justice and an end to police brutality.“Together we are more,” a speaker said.On a breezy spring evening in Washington, this scene illustrates the peaceful demonstration that is starkly at odds with violent rioting and looting.“Make it quick,” one man said, “curfew is coming up in 30 minutes.”The peaceful demonstration concluded when the 7 p.m. curfew in D.C. went into effect.ATLANTA — Six Atlanta police officers are being charged with using excessive force during an arrest of two college students at a protest on Saturday night, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced Tuesday.The officers were filmed in downtown Atlanta breaking windows of a vehicle, yanking a woman out of the car and tasing a man. The two victims were later identified as college students at Spellman and Morehouse, both historically black schools, and were returning from protests calling for an end to police violence against black citizens.Arrest warrants have been issued for Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Some of the charges against the officers include aggravated assault of Messiah Young, aggravated assault of Taniyah Pilgrim, simple battery and criminal damage to property, Howard said.Two of the six officers, Streeter and Gardner, were terminated Sunday by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The West Virginia National Guard is pursuing disciplinary action against a guardsman who posted on social media that he would shoot at people protesting the death of George Floyd, officials said Tuesday.The guardsman, Noah Garcelon, has already resigned his position as an officer with the Winfield Police Department after making the comments. In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would “start firing live rounds” at protesters and “see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.”Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state’s National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others “who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.”Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn’t a racist before resigning.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent.PHILADELPHIA — Joe Biden in a speech on Tuesday condemned President Donald Trump over the use of tear gas against peaceful protesters outside the White House in order to clear a park so that the president could visit a church for a photo opportunity.""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it every once in a while instead of just brandishing it,"" the former vice president and presumptive Democratic 2020 nominee said in Philadelphia.Characterizing the moment as a ""battle for the soul of our nation"" — an echo of Biden's central campaign theme — Biden condemned Trump's actions Monday night, which played out on live television as protesters who had been chanting with their hands in the air were suddenly scattered throughout Washington's streets.""When peaceful protestors are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op, a photo op, at one of the most historic churches in the country or at least Washington, DC, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said.LAS VEGAS — An officer has been shot in Las Vegas and authorities are responding to another shooting as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said.The officer was shot in the area of the Las Vegas Strip and an officer was involved in a shooting in the downtown area, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.The department said both shootings were on Las Vegas Boulevard.Protesters have been rallying for days across the country over the death of Floyd, who was seen on video pleading that he couldn’t breathe with a white police officer pressing his knee into his neck for several minutes before Floyd stopped moving.Police in Las Vegas said Monday that 338 people were arrested during three nights of protests. Police said suspects were jailed despite a local court policy calling for most people accused of misdemeanors to receive court summons to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ST. LOUIS —Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area.The police department tweeted early Tuesday that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots.The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City.On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64.But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. CICERO, Ill. — Authorities in a Chicago suburb where two people were fatally shot in unrest following George Floyd’s death are issuing fresh safety precautions Tuesday.Cicero officials cautioned residents to “stay home and stay off the streets” a day after violence and destruction erupted in the town of about 84,000 west of Chicago. Police say most of Monday’s chaos stemmed from residents trying to defend businesses. Roughly 60 people were arrested, mostly for burglary and weapons violations.Two men in their 20s were fatally shot around 6 p.m. in separate incidents related to the violent clashes.

At least 40 cities have enacted nighttime curfews, and more than a dozen states have deployed the National Guard. But not all demonstrations have been violent. In Minneapolis, demonstrators gathering at the intersection with Floyd encountered police to remember the Minneapolis police chief also took a knee at the site and acknowledged Police needs to do better for community members.

Advertisement Officials see extremist groups stoking violence and disinformation during protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media.As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work.Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort.The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations.The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a ""very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers."" President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to ""identify criminal organizers,"" and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group.The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against ""violent radical agitators"" who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops ""easy targets,"" two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal ""kit,"" meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police.Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized ""Boogaloo"" movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war.She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some ""boogaloo bois"" in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear.""They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,"" MacNab said.She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest.Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina.Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity.The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump's handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were ""good people on both sides"" of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia.America's racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island.""This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,"" said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. ""That's one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don't create new issues, you exploit existing issues.""There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook.Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a ""child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities.Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials.",0.0

Kia Yanna Monroe, one of the protesters, was out picking up trash along with others left behind in areas where protesters assembled. “I was here protesting on Saturday, and I just noticed that after the protest there’s a lot of garbage, a lot of bottles, a lot of stuff that’s on the ground. Just wanted to come out and clean up a little bit,” she said. “I think it’s important. I understand why everybody’s out here. I’m part of it, but I also think our city needs to be cleaned too,” she said. Monroe said it’s “just the right thing to do,” and that other people were out cleaning during the weekend. She said all the violence and looting was hard to see since the protests are supposed to be peaceful. “It was a little rough being down here cause some people are using the Black Lives Matter in a very negative way, trying to cause more commotion that it needs to be, she said. “It’s supposed to be peaceful protests, and some people turning it into making it become violent which is not the answer.” Everybody, especially police, she said, needs to sit down and talk about how to move forward. “Clearly, conversation needs to be had,” she said. “Everybody needs to listen to each other, especially the cops. They way they’re handling it now, I don’t think is the right way cause you are shooting at us, macing us. You are tear-gassing us when all we’re trying to do is peacefully protest and wanting somebody to listen to us.” Across downtown, on Congress Ave. Kelly Johnson and her daughter Daphne had the same idea. “I was very supportive of the protests, but I just didn’t like the way the city was left,” Johnson said. She runs IREP, an Austin-based junk hauling company that donates items people leave behind to those in need. She and Daphne planned to use their equipment to help haul away trash, as well. However, by the time they got downtown Monday, others like Monroe had already finished most of that work. “We realized that there was not a lot of trash to pick up, but we saw all the graffiti. And, so, we pivoted,” Johnson said. She and her daughter picked up some graffiti removal spray and spent the day scrubbing off spray paint in front of businesses. Seeing it through the eyes of her mom, who runs a small business of her own, Daphne urged people to think about who vandalism and looting is actually hurting. “I get why people are angry. They have every right to be,” Daphne said. “But when you damage things that have nothing to do with it, like who knows if these people who run this might be totally with you. Damaging their property isn’t going to make it…it just doesn’t help anything. It doesn’t prove a point. It just makes people mad.” Johnson added that’s especially true in the middle of a pandemic. “The businesses have suffered so much already, and it’s like they didn’t need this on top of it, you know?” The mother-daughter pair plans to keep working throughout the week and is inviting others to help. “Cause Daphne and I, were pretty fit, but there’s only so much we can do by ourselves,” Johnson smiled. The Johnsons say anyone who would like to help can reach out to them through their company’s contact form. “We’ll just keep working until we can get this city back to, you know, showing it off again,” Johnson said.",0.0

(NEXSTAR/AP) – After six straight days of unrest, America heads into a new work week with neighborhoods in shambles, urban streets on lockdown and political leaders struggling to control the coast-to-coast outpouring of rage over police killings of black people. Despite curfews in big cities across the U.S. and the deployment of thousands of National Guard soldiers over the past week, demonstrations descended into violence again on Sunday.

Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin, Texas, and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them first, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis.

In other places, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators. The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes. Demonstrators flee after a march turned violent in Manhattan, New York City. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Breonna Taylor to death in her home in March. The upheaval has unfolded amid the gloom and economic ruin caused by the coronavirus, which has killed over 100,000 Americans and sent unemployment soaring to levels not seen since the Depression. The outbreak has hit minorities especially hard, not just in infections and deaths but in job losses and economic stress. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests has rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count compiled by The Associated Press. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name!” Protesters hold signs in Detroit, Michigan on May 31, 2020 following a night of protests that saw several arrests and use of tear gas by the Detroit Police department. (Photo by SETH HERALD/AFP via Getty Images) At the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, police fired tear gas and stun grenades Sunday into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a street nearby. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the flames. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office was burned down. The district’s entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to Pentagon officials. As the unrest grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton, who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to demonstrators. He also wrote a post online expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. In New York, thieves raided luxury stores, including Chanel, Rolex and Prada boutiques.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Thousands marched peacefully in Phoenix; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying the destruction weakens calls for justice and reform. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said t wo officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday and using stun guns on the man and woman inside. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. Scores of people swarmed into stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags.

All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest, but thousands marching on a closed freeway were shaken when a tractor-trailer rolled into their midst. No serious injuries were reported. The driver was arrested on suspicion of assault. In tweets Sunday, Trump accused anarchists and the media of fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems.

1622469611,2020-06-01 12:47:49,Kaepernick's Criticism Echoes Through Floyd Protests,https://www.wypr.org/post/kaepernicks-criticism-echoes-through-floyd-protests,en,False,"blacks, football, demonstrations and riots",245165,wypr.org,http://wypr.org/,"In the wake of the horrifying death of George Floyd, social media timelines have been flooded this past week with amazing words and images. Some of the pictures and videos of unleashed anger and protests in the streets of the nation’s cities have been heartbreaking while the words have been, in many cases, eye-opening , especially from sports figures. While a few, like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s stunning op-ed in Sunday’s Los Angeles Times, have been searing commentary on the state of black America, others, like NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s say all the right things statement, barely scratched the surface. Goodell’s response, in particular, stands in stark contrast to the front page of Sunday’s sports section of the Houston Chronicle. The page is in black with white lettering and has the word Imagine written four times above copy that asks the reader to envision a world where former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s protest had been acknowledged. The page suggests that Americans could be working toward a solution to the issues that have prompted the protests of the last week rather than the violence and arrests that have marked the uprising. And then, with pictures of Floyd and Kaepernick flanking opposite parts of the page, the Chronicle gets to the heart of the matter in these words quote: Because this is exactly what Kaepernick was protesting. Not the anthem. Not the flag. Not the military. But unchecked police brutality against people of color like George Floyd in our country unquote. The page in general and that paragraph in particular are a shot across the bow of the noblesse oblige of people like Goodell and the NFL’s 32 owners. Except, as we’ve seen time and time again, the privileged folks who run and own the nation’s most popular sports operation don’t operate with a sense of generosity to their black players or fans. Kaepernick is living proof of that fact. He remains without a job or even a serious tryout for a job five years after speaking a truth that has become self-evident even to those who don’t want to see. If you could watch the video of a Minneapolis policeman kneel on the neck of Floyd and somehow be more outraged by the kneeling of Kaepernick for a righteous cause, then you could be, among other things, an NFL owner. Indeed, while Colin Kaepernick sits and waits, former Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco, Kaepernick’s opponent in Super Bowl 47, was signed last week by the New York Jets. Flacco is three years older than Kaepernick and is recovering from a herniated disc in his neck that will keep him from practicing, practicing, mind you before September. Meanwhile, Kaepernick is ready to go now. Going forward, for all the words you hear from and about athletes and their willingness to wade into social and political commentary, the three that should be rendered forevermore meaningless are ""stick to sports"". And that’s how I see it for this week. Thanks for listening and enjoy the games…whenever they return. Get in touch Email: sportsatlarge@gmail.com Twitter: @SportsAtLarge",0.0

Don't pretend there's not a problem in America. Don't turn your back on racism. Don't accept innocent lives being taken from us. Don't make any more excuses. Don't think this doesn't affect you. Don't sit back and be silent. Don't think you can't be part of the change. Let's all be part of the change.""Nike's message comes four days after George Floyd, 46, died in police custody in Minnesota with his last moments caught on video. While being arrested, Floyd was held down by a Minneapolis police officer's knee. The video shows Floyd pleading that he is in pain and can't breathe. Then, his eyes shut and the pleas stop. He was pronounced dead shortly after. The officer was arrested Friday and charged with murder.This isn't the first time Nike has used their slogan for more than just sports.""Nike has a long history of standing against bigotry, hatred and inequality in all forms,"" Nike said in a statement to CNN Saturday. ""We hope that by sharing this film we can serve as a catalyst to inspire action against a deep issue in our society and encourage people to help shape a better future.""To mark the ""Just Do It"" slogan's 30th anniversary in 2018, Nike released an ad with Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who kneeled in protest during the National Anthem for a preseason NFL game.

But in Baltimore, the scene following the death of George Floyd is very different. Over the weekend, mass protests were held downtown, but only 14 people were arrested for crimes like destruction of property and burglary. Both officers and protesters share the credit, Police Commissioner Michael Harrison told C4. ""It is our duty and privilege to serve the people to allow them to protest and the only thing we ask is that they do it peacefully and they have done that,"" Harrison said. ""And only when it got dark and the protesters left a few people, agitators, probably less than 100 then it got to be about 50 or less, began to just taunt the police and do things."" The department was put under a federal consent decree after a U.S. Department of Justice investigation conducted after the death of Freddie Gray found a pattern of civil rights abuses by the department. Harrison came to Baltimore from New Orleans, another department under a consent decree for a history of civil rights violations. He said his officers did a ""remarkable job of exercising restraint and professionalism and tolerance and acceptance,"" singling out Lt. Peter Heron, who defused a confrontation at police headquarters by reading a list of police brutality victims off a protester's sign. ""If anyone needs proof that this department is changing they only need to look right there at that. That's a cultural shift in the department where a member of our department exercised empathy and empathized with a protesting crowd,"" Harrison said. ""And to even go beyond, to deescalate people. If you think about it, that can be very, very intimidating, a few police officers with hundreds of people taunting you, in your face."" .@wbalradio Video: Here is a group of about a couple dozen so far peaceful protesters who have taken to the streets of #Baltimore chanting & reading names along the way with @BaltimorePolice keeping an eye on them as they head back to @BaltCityHall Listen to #WBALRadio @C4Show pic.twitter.com/RANxCfr6hq — Scott Wykoff (@ScottWykoffWBAL) June 1, 2020 He said that these actions don't detract from the crime fight. Rather, he said, they are critical to it. ""It does not mean we are becoming weak. It does not mean we are becoming soft or passive. That is not true at all,"" Harrison said. ""It means we are becoming compassionate and empathetic, which means people will be more inclined to help us to provide information to us because nobody wants you to know how much they know until they first know how much you care."" He said he acted quickly to put out a statement and suspend an officer after a bystander's video showed a woman who may have been suffering mental health issues who took swings at an officer before being punched to the ground by a second officer. ""I just thought it was important to make sure that that needs to be investigated,"" Harrison said. In tweets on Sunday, Gov. Larry Hogan commended the work of city and state police to prevent confrontations from turning violent. He called Baltimore an example for the nation.

Police reported arresting 14 people, including two minors, following reports of damage to businesses and burglaries Saturday night. Baltimore has been spared much of the violence and damage reported in other U.S. cities, including New York City and Los Angeles, leading both Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young and Governor Larry Hogan to call the demonstrators in the city a national example. “In Baltimore yesterday, we were a national example of what it looks like to engage in passionate protesting without widespread breaking of the law,” Young said.

(WRIC) — Daylight revealed burned and looted buildings after Richmond’s second night of riots. What started on Friday and Saturday as peaceful protests devolved again into vandalism across the city. The protests are in response to the death of George Floyd, who was seen last week on video being pinned down by three Minneapolis officers while in police custody. One officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on Floyd’s neck as he continuously yelled in distress. Saturday night, fires were set across the city including at stores on W. Broad Street near Lombardy Street.

1622611819,2020-06-01 14:08:15,Feast of Pentecost marks return of public worship in Baltimore Archdiocese,https://www.archbalt.org/feast-of-pentecost-marks-return-of-public-worship-in-baltimore-archdiocese/,en,False,"christians and christianity, religion and churches, medicine and health, crime and criminals, diseases and conditions",94185,catholicreview.org,http://catholicreview.org/#spider,"FULLERTON – As the first reading on the Feast of the Pentecost, from the Acts of the Apostles, got to a “strong, driving wind,” some gathered May 31 for 12:30 p.m. Mass at St. Joseph Parish nodded in recognition. The church in northeast Baltimore County was among those in the Archdiocese of Baltimore celebrating public liturgies for the first time since mid-March, when the coronavirus pandemic shut down Maryland and large swaths of the nation. St. Joseph did so outside, on a wind-swept youth soccer field, with the faithful bringing their own lawn chairs or blankets to sit on. Approximately 500 attended 10:30 a.m. Mass, and another 250 came out for the 12:30 p.m. celebration. Men wore hats to protect themselves from the sun, among them Father Jesse Bolger, pastor, who preached underneath a Baltimore Orioles cap. Despite countless other modifications, such as the Eucharist only in the solid form and social distancing, the faithful appeared grateful to be together for the first time in nearly three months. Like tens of thousands throughout the archdiocese, Ginny Phillips had remained home and watched livestreams of Mass, which were limited to 10 clergy and liturgical ministers. What did she most miss about attending Mass in person? “I’ve been going to 4:30 (Saturday afternoons) here forever,” said Phillips, who attended St. Joseph School in the 1960s. “I’ve missed the contemporary group; they’re terrific, the music and hymns.” A member of the hospitality ministry at St. Joseph, she wore a “Faith Over Fear” mask to 12:30 p.m Mass and helped staff a tent where water bottles were available. Her teammates at that tent included Thelma Sam. “Watching a livestream every Sunday is not the same,” Sam said, of virtual worship. “Sitting by yourself at home is not the same as seeing familiar faces.” Born in Belgium but raised in Ghana, Sam reflects the diversity that St. Joseph Parish has embraced. On Pentecost Sunday, which celebrates the birth of the church, Prayers of the Faithful were offered, in order, in English, Tagalog, Spanish, Urdu, Malayalam, Slovenian, Polish and Kiswahili. Father Bolger’s homily contrasted the Feast of the Pentecost with the current state of American affairs. “How did we get to this place,” asked Father Bolger, who mentioned the pandemic lockdown and “rioting in our cities” in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, where one of the police officers restraining him was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. In talking of the “fire of the Holy Spirit,” Father Bolger referenced themes of unity, understanding and urgency. “Why did God create us? What is our purpose?” he asked. “We have to do the Lord’s work, even during a pandemic. Let us not see a virus and unrest keep us from that (work).” Father Bolger told his people that the parish will continue to offer the 10:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. Masses outside, “weather permitting.” St. Joseph will resume 4:30 p.m. Mass for the public in its church June 6, as well as 7 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. Mass June 7. Churches in Carroll, Frederick, Harford and Washington counties also opened liturgies to the public, albeit at one-third capacity, per Archdiocese of Baltimore guidelines. All parishes, according to those guidelines, “must adhere to the directives and guidance of local jurisdictions,” which meant that Catholic churches in Baltimore City, Anne Arundel and Howard Counties remained closed the weekend of Pentecost. St. Margaret in Bel Air normally seats 900, but reopened to the public with a capacity of 270. It had approximately 70 people for 4 p.m. Mass May 30, among them Helen Green, who received congratulations on her 90th birthday from Monsignor Kevin Schenning, pastor. “It feels like coming home after a long vacation,” Donna Smucker said. “I’m glad to be back.” The archdiocesan guidelines left St. Joseph in Emmitsburg distributing a maximum of 100 tickets to each of its three weekend Masses. Its largest gathering was 48 people for 4:30 p.m. Mass May 30. Even dismissal was organized, beginning with the back rows and proceeding to the front. “Our people will come back slowly,” said Vincentian Father Martin McGeough, pastor. “We’ll continue to livestream 8 a.m. Mass, no matter when Phase III (full reopening) happens, because that’s something shut-ins can utilize. The only thing that’s going to change there, hopefully we’ll be able to get to these people and bring them Communion.” Elsewhere in Emmitsburg, an outdoor Mass May 31, at 11 a.m., drew 283 people to the Basilica of the National Shrine of St. Elizabeth Seton. Institute of the Incarnate Word Father Ted Trinko remained for several hours afterward, to hear confessions. St. Joseph in Hagerstown had a similar “soft opening,” according to Father John J. Jicha, pastor. It moved Masses to the parish hall, where the largest gathering, 85 people, was for the 2:15 p.m. Mass in Spanish May 31. Coordination included plenty of signage, volunteers directing the faithful where to sit and a housekeeping crew disinfecting surfaces after each Mass. “A few really wanted to come back, and I’m glad we were able to accommodate them,” Father Jicha said. “Many parishioners are still trying to be careful, especially those who are older and who have underlying health conditions. I think that’s smart of them to stay home at this point. “Knowing that we were able to do it as well as we did and as safely as we did, I will be encouraging more people to come, but everybody has to make their own decision.” Christopher Gunty and Kevin J.

But he wrote in a post Monday on Medium that the ""the small minority of folks who've resorted to violence"" at many demonstrations are ""putting innocent people at risk, compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause."" He recounted seeing an interview, where he said, ""I saw an elderly black woman being interviewed today in tears because the only grocery store in her neighborhood had been trashed. If history is any guide, that store may take years to come back. So let's not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it.""

Mayors and county executives, Obama wrote, appoint police chiefs and negotiate with police unions, while district attorneys and state's attorneys ""decide whether or not to investigate and ultimately charge those involved in police misconduct."" All are elected positions, Obama said, which usually suffer from ""pitifully low"" voter turnout, ""especially among young people — which makes no sense given the direct impact these offices have on social justice issues, not to mention the fact that who wins and who loses those seats is often determined by just a few thousand, or even a few hundred, votes."" Obama established a task force on ""21st-century policing"" in 2014 after Michael Brown's shooting death by police in Ferguson Mo., which led to violence there. Many police and criminal justice reforms outlined by Obama and his Justice Department have been abandoned during the Trump administration. President Trump has called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" and urged state and local governments to take aggressive action to quell any violent unrest. ",0.0

I'm Terry Gross. Like so many Americans and people around the world, I was horrified watching the video of the police officer - now charged with manslaughter and third-degree murder - who had his knee on George Floyd's neck for over eight minutes, keeping the weight on Floyd's neck even after he died. My heart was broken. It was broken again over the weekend as I watched peaceful protests against the death of Floyd and other black men and women who died at the hands of police become violent confrontations in cities around America, including Philadelphia, where I live, and Brooklyn, where I grew up. Philadelphia has been preparing to allow businesses that were closed due to the pandemic to reopen this Friday. Now in the heart of our business and shopping district that also has medical offices, food markets, pharmacies and many apartments, stores have had their windows broken, been looted, some set on fire and destroyed. Just a few days ago, the streets were pretty empty, with people practicing social distancing. By the weekend, in Philly and cities around the country, thousands of people were in the streets, which public health officials fear could lead to a surge in cases of COVID-19. We asked Eric Adams to join us because he has insights about this moment from several perspectives. When he was 15, he was arrested and beaten by police. He later became a police officer with the intent of helping to reform the police. In 1995, he co-founded the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care to work from within the NYPD against police brutality and racial profiling. After serving on the force for 22 years, retiring as a captain, he served in the New York State Senate for seven years. He was elected Brooklyn borough president in 2013 and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn's CEO. Brooklyn has been a pandemic hot spot and the location of large protests, some of which turned violent. Eric Adams, welcome back to FRESH AIR. We're recording this late Sunday afternoon. We don't know what will happen Sunday night. What are your concerns about the actions of the police and the protesters in Brooklyn? ERIC ADAMS: Many levels, Terry. I have mixed emotions. No. 1, I'm extremely excited and pleased to see our young people taking to the streets. Historically, the winds of change, they have always been blown by young adults. Young people are very much a part of the movement. And we're seeing that they are lifting their voices. And so I'm happy to see that, but I'm also concerned because embedded into a righteous movement is a group of well-trained people who - their goal is not police abuse but disruption. They're trained on incendiary devices, how to make them. They're trained on how to agitate. Some of them are carrying firearms. And if we're not careful, they will hijack this righteous movement, and that alarms me and concerns me. GROSS: Who do you think those well-trained people are and who do you think trained them? What do you know about that? ADAMS: It's a combination. Some of them, believe it or not - this strange marriage has been created between right-wing militias who have infiltrated the bodies of some of these movements across our country and even here in New York, and others are those who are just believers that we need to burn down our cities. I know that they had groups here staking out the city to see how police move and where police are located. I've been debriefed on some of the people who have been involved. Like, one car we found in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, had several Molotov cocktails and a tank full of gasoline to make incendiary devices. The young lady who pulled up at the 88th Precinct, what happened to have been one of my precincts as an officer, she pulled up and threw a Molotov cocktail at a police vehicle. We're seeing jeeps burned and vans burned. And the young African Americans who are fighting police abuse all across the country, they are doing it in a peaceful fashion. And if we're not careful, those who have infiltrated these peaceful, righteous groups are going to put these young people in a very harmful state. GROSS: What's your reaction, as a former police officer, to seeing police precincts in Brooklyn under attack? I mean, protesters tried to breach and enter a police precinct in Brooklyn, and outside Brooklyn's 88th Precinct, there was another large clash with crowds. What's your reaction to that? Like, how do you think police should be handling it when their precincts come under attack? ADAMS: And that's so important because look at the last series of marches that really put in place serious changes across the country. When you looked at those marches, you did not see people go into the 88th Precinct and other precincts in this city; you saw the organizers, the marches, you saw them stop businesses, stop traffic, maybe stop transportation. They were doing die-ins. They were doing real things to allow their voices to be heard. And that's why we have to ask, what's different here? How did we go from those extremely important ways of being heard to a point that we are actually trying to take over precincts, that we're firebombing vehicles? I was out last night at 1:30 in the morning on Flatbush Avenue and saw the number of businesses that were destroyed. And as I went into Clinton Hill, I saw property owners, people who actually own homes, I saw their homes damaged as well. And so we must make sure that we have the right balance between public protection from our police officers and to weed out those who are damaging what these young people are doing. I've been speaking with the Black Lives Matters organizers of Brooklyn and others who are part of the righteous pursuit to end police brutality to show them how to distance themselves from those who are trying to hijack their movement. GROSS: Would you like to see people from Black Lives Matter speaking out against the violence and distancing themselves from it? ADAMS: Yes, I would. And that is part of the conversation that I've had with some of the leaders. And I understand their concerns because they don't want to give a pathway. Sometimes when you speak out against something, it's manipulated in another fashion, and so they are extremely concerned about that. And we're trying to find a way that they can effectively distance themselves from what they're seeing but, at the same time, keep the focus on the mission of turning around police abuse. But I guess I would like to do that, and that is part of the conversations I've been having with them. GROSS: And let's get back to the police. I know - like, because we talked about this once before on the show - when you were a police officer, there were times when, during the day, you would be joining protesters against police abuse, and then in the evening, you'd be policing the protesters in your job as a police officer. And people would make assumptions about you as an officer, assumptions that were often not true, about where your sympathies lay. So let's talk about policing right now. I suspect that a lot of police officers sympathize with the protesters, yet at the same time, cannot allow violence in their cities. They can't allow the destruction of property, although all of that has happened anyways. Talk a little bit from your perspective as a former police officer what you think the police are up against and the kind of difficult decisions they have to make. ADAMS: That's a great question because - and you're right. The - remember; we recruit police officers from a society that is filled with healthy and toxic individuals. And when you come into the law enforcement arena, many of the individuals who are not suitable to be a police officer, they find root in a culture that really protected even the toxic individuals. The police department - actually, the police departments across America - they have never been good at immediately weeding out those who are not suitable. To have two of the most important rights that a human being can have in a country like America - the right to take freedom and the right to take away one's life - those are rights that not even the president - thank God, with this president - a president doesn't even have. So when you give someone those rights, you need to have an awesome amount of oversight, an awesome amount of obligation, and we have not done that historically. And when you look at the video footage - I've been closely watching the video footage, and I've been - I have intentionally went to many of the protests last night. I was - like I said, I was on Flatbush Avenue watching some of the interaction. When you look at the video footage, there's something that is glaring. There is a body of officers who are really suited to do this type of enforcement, and then there's a body of officers that are really not suited to do it. Now, what do I mean by that? And, Terry, we really need to reexamine how we assign police officers in our country. Everyone who is in the occupation is not suitable for every role in the occupation. There are officers that I, as a platoon commander, I enjoyed having with me when I had to kick in a door to go after someone that was committing a crime, had a gun. But I wouldn't want that same person with me if I was speaking to someone that was trying to talk someone off a ledge or dealing with a hostage situation. And so we don't assign officers based on their abilities to carry out the crafts that are needed in a particular time. Policing basically just brings everyone together. Saying, if you have on a blue uniform, you're suitable to do all the jobs - that is a big mistake, and we need to change that. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams. He's the borough president of Brooklyn. He's a former New York City police officer who co-founded 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, which was a police reform group against racial profiling and police assaults. He was also assaulted by the police when he was 15. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams, and we're talking about the protests over the weekend. At age 15, he was beaten by police. And in the hope of helping reform the policing of black people and neighborhoods, he joined the New York City police and, after 22 years, retired as a captain. He became a state senator in New York and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn Borough president, the CEO of Brooklyn. Brooklyn has been a site of large protests against the death of George Floyd in police hands. It's also been a hot spot in the pandemic. Were you ever, as a police officer, patrolling a protest that turned violent? And if so, what was that like for you? What were some of the most complicated actions and decisions you had to make? ADAMS: Extremely complicated, extremely frightening. Even when you put on a blue uniform, you do not take away the fright and flight hard-wiring inside you. And the goal is I go in with the mindset - or whoever I'm working with, I'm asking them before I start it - as a football team goes into a huddle, I go into a huddle and say, listen; we are our brother's keeper. That was the No. 1 thing I told my officers at several protests. I was here in the midst of many of the stop-and-frisk protests, the Abner Louima protest, the Dorismond protest - some of the real height - and I policed under Giuliani's administration and under Bloomberg and Commissioner Kelly. We had protests all the time. What I learned was that if you make sure that the officers know that you are my brother's keeper and if I am going over the edge, if I'm not doing the job the way it's supposed to because my adrenaline is flowing and I am responding instead of being the professional I ought to be, stop me, pause me, pull me to the side, take me, disengage me. And there were times when a person was extremely difficult to deal with - in some cases violent dealing with them - that you have to do the necessary force to terminate the condition. What you're seeing in some of the videos, you're seeing people handcuffed, and officers are still swinging their baton, and no one is stopping them. We're not teaching de-escalation. We teach de-escalation of the person who's committing the act; we're not teaching de-escalation of the officers who are trying to terminate the act. And I always instructed my officers when I was a sergeant, a lieutenant and a captain the skill of de-escalation and being your brother's keeper to prevent an incident getting out of hand. GROSS: We've all seen in times during the protests over the weekend when protesters were intentionally provoking the police - throwing things at them, setting their cars on fire. From your perspective as a former police officer who opposes police brutality, who opposes racial profiling, who opposes these murders of black people, what is the response a police officer should have when they are intentionally being violently provoked? ADAMS: It's so important. And my history - this is my life's work, dealing with police abuse, from being arrested as a young man, being told by civil rights leaders to go into the police department. I'm committed to having effective policing, but I'm also committed to something else. I'm committed to public safety. And in those cases where you see police vehicles being burned, where you see rocks being thrown, those people should be immediately apprehended and arrested. And we have to be swift about it, and we have to be - have a zero-tolerance. So that zero-tolerance of not allowing police to be abusive must also be a zero-tolerance not to allow people to attack police because that uniform is not the person in the uniform; it's the symbol of our stability. I know it has been a symbol of pain, but it also has been a symbol of the stability of this country and this city. And we need to reform it, but we can never tear down that stability that we use. So I don't go - I'm not part of that group that says disband the police departments. I'm not part of that group that says we can live in a society with no police at all. You do need some form of law and order and not unlawfulness and disorder. GROSS: Let's talk about what happened to you when you were 15 and that - how that affected your view of the police. I mean, you had been charged with trespassing. Just give us a brief sense of what the charge was. ADAMS: I was a 15-year-old child. I grew up - part of my childhood was in Bayside High School, when I left Brooklyn before returning. And my brother and I, we were arrested for criminal trespassing. Once the officers took us to the precinct - they picked us up from school, took us to the precinct. And they were filling out the paperwork, and out of nowhere, they said, you feel like a beat down? And they brought the two of us - we thought we were being transported somewhere. But they took us to the lower part of the 103rd Precinct, the same precinct Sean Bell was killed in. And they just started kicking us in the groin, you know, repeatedly. It was unbelievable. I remember acting like I passed out to get them to stop. The pain was just excruciating, if you can only imagine. And we - you know, I know I urinated blood for a week after that. And I remember every day saying to myself, Terry, that, you know, I'm going to tell my mother if it doesn't stop after the next day, the next day. And eventually, it concluded. And we never talked about that, my brother and I, until we were adults. And I think until this day, he still is suffering from mental health illness because of that because I experience PTSD. I could not see a police car go by without reliving that moment. I could not see a police show on TV. Every time I heard a siren - can you imagine just having that part of the wiring in your brain? And I think oftentimes police officers that have bad intentions do that to young people to - almost like slave masters used to do horrific things to instill fear into slaves. And it wasn't until after Randolph Evans was shot and killed that a group of leaders in Brooklyn from the Black United Front told me and 13 others to go into law enforcement. I didn't want to do that. I was a computer programmer. I wanted to open my own firm and become Cisco qualified. But I felt obligated, and it really was a life-changing experience for me, and it allowed me to turn that pain into purpose. And you know what? I finally found the refuge I needed, that I no longer felt the trauma from that beating. I felt as though that demasculation (ph) was behind me because I was using that pain in a way of turning around the lives of people. GROSS: So you're in a position of understanding the pain that a lot of black people feel when they think about the police. Were police ever a good force in your life before you became an officer? Did they ever help you or protect you? ADAMS: No. And it's unfortunate that there was always this adversarial relationship with law enforcement. And remember - you know, you don't call the police in South Jamaica, Queens, or Brownsville or East New York to invite them to a party; you call them when someone shot up the party. So when you have a relationship with an entity in your community that is only built on when there is something terribly wrong, you begin to associate pain with the profession. And so that is why proactive policing is so important in changing - how we utilize our law enforcement community is so important because I didn't have those good stories that some of my colleagues - when I attended Bayside High School and I used to hear - some of the students in the class talked about the good things they did, you know, with the police, how some of them were in the Boy Scouts or was part of the DARE program and just these interactions. And I was like, what are you talking about? They're cops. Who - (laughter) you know, who has these relationships with cops? And it was difficult because there was nothing, no point of reference of the beauty of having a good relationship with your law enforcement in your community. GROSS: My guest is Eric Adams, a former NYPD police captain. In 1995, he co-founded the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care to work from within the NYPD against police brutality and racial profiling. He now serves as Brooklyn bureau president. We'll talk more after a break. And then later, Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel by Brit Bennett, whose first novel, the bestseller ""The Mothers,"" was optioned by Kerry Washington. And David Bianculli will review three TV shows, one from the new streaming service HBO Max. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DARRELL GRANT'S ""FILS DU SOLEIL (FOR TONY WILLIAMS)"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams. At age 15, he was beaten by police. In the hope of helping reform the policing of black neighborhoods, he joined the New York City Police and, after 22 years, retired as a captain. He became a state senator and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn borough president, the CEO of Brooklyn. Brooklyn has been the site of large protests against the death of George Floyd in police hands. Brooklyn is also a hotspot for the pandemic. You know, I really do think there's a lot of police officers around the country who are really angry and really furious about what happened to George Floyd. And they're probably suffering too because now they're out on the streets in the middle of a pandemic fighting with people that they don't want to be in confrontation with. What do you think police can do or should do to show their anger at police who behave badly or brutally, or who are, you know, responsible for the deaths of people? ADAMS: We have to really change the culture of policing. We have police here in the city that put up a white power finger sign. And all the other police officers started cheering and laughing with them. When you have some of the actions of - we almost have to rebuild our law enforcement community because the recruitment effort we did, we focus on law enforcement, again, and not on how we deal with social issues - and build this symbiotic relationship between our policing community. And then you have to change the culture of really supporting a climate, a healthy climate, where an officer could come forward and report abuse without any form of reprisal. We must refocus and revamp police. And I think this is an opportunity to do so, as we saw in New Jersey some of the police chiefs marching with some of the demonstrators. And something else happened with the Floyd case that some people may have overlooked - it was a significant moment - one, the expeditious fashion in which the police officer was fired, second, how fast the prosecutor indicted. Now, the indictment itself is troubling to me, which is another conversation. But they moved quickly. The third - the other officers were fired. They should also be arrested. But the mere fact they were fired was a cosmic shift in policing, because the tone is now set that your actions will also - you're responsible for not only for your actions, but the actions of the person who you are near. Standing around watching someone choke to death, you should be held accountable the same way as someone participated in a robbery. They acted in concert. That is how we should treat those officers that are carrying out these actions. GROSS: I know a lot of people would agree with you that there's been, you know, progress made in how fast these actions were taken. But that doesn't seem to have had any effect on the protests. ADAMS: And it shouldn't. We have to keep the pressure on. We have a long way to go. And I am - as I stated, I'm excited about these protests because it is as though I've come full circle. I've marched in these protests when we were fighting against stop-and-frisk. I remember looking beside me and seeing these different ethnic groups who peacefully joined with me. I recall that the - in the protests, as you indicated, taking off my jeans and shirt and putting on my police uniforms and feeling as though my day was fulfilled. I felt accomplished. I felt as though I was able to protect the city and, at the same time, force them to allow our police agencies to become who and what they are. And I think these protests play a significant role, because let's face it, a absence of the Dr. Kings, the SNCCs, the Rosa Parks and so many others, America would not have moved in the area that it should have moved. We would've never signed civil rights bills. We would have never done some of the things that we did. If it wasn't for the women's suffrage movement, we would still probably not have women voting. Hitting the streets and showing you're outraged and not comfortable is something that's part of America as apple pie and Chevrolet. And we need to continue to hit the streets to move America where it ought to go. GROSS: Right now, given how hot the situation is, do you want to see people continuing to hit the streets? ADAMS: It's a very delicate balance. I'm really afraid about the COVID-19. As you know, I spent the last 50-plus days sleeping in my office from the time that COVID hit the shores here in New York City. And what we have done around this issue - and the same communities that are dealing with police abuse are the communities that were negatively impacted disproportionately by coronavirus. And so I'm afraid that many of our young people are going to take the infection home to their loved ones, their seniors, their grandmothers. And it is a true concern. And when I saw people participating in the protest, I did see some who were wearing face mask. But clearly, an overwhelming number of them were not practicing social distancing. I am concerned that, you know, body fluids, being in close proximity is going to have family members that are going to be infected. Young people who are going to leave the protests and go home, they are going to infect their loved ones. And COVID virus is serious, is real. And the same communities that are dealing with police abuse were disproportionately impacted by the lack of government response to coronavirus. GROSS: I'm obviously really worried about that, too. And, you know, Brooklyn has been a pandemic hotspot. And, you know, in Philly, Philly's preparing to reopen on Friday. Philly was preparing to go yellow. And now, like, who knows what the consequences for the pandemic will be from all the protests over the weekend? And I'm sure that's true for many cities. Like, we know what happened in New Orleans after Mardi Gras. And this was not a celebratory parade. These were protests. But it's still, in terms of the virus, it can have the same impact of thousands of people in the streets, shoulder-to-shoulder. Many of them were wearing masks. But at that close proximity, you know, who knows? How much of a setback do you fear this will be for Brooklyn, where you are the Brooklyn borough president? ADAMS: I think it's going to be a significant setback. But what I've learned - I recall after 9/11. And when the Trade Center was attacked and the buildings collapsed, I remember going out to Brownsville, a predominately black community, to talk to the young people and deal with the trauma of the buildings collapsing. And they were playing basketball and just hanging out. And I've told them, did you hear what happened? They said, Eric, we were catching hell when those buildings were up. We didn't have heat at night. We had lead paint. Crime was high. We were unemployed. Those buildings have nothing to do with us. People can feel so much pain that they become numb to the reality of danger. And I think that's what you're seeing here. Many of these young people have been living in a state of just total hopelessness and don't feel as though another level of trauma is going to do anything to dissipate the trauma that they're experiencing already. And somehow, we have to convince them that life is not about being hopeless, but about being empowered. And while we do that, we have to understand that that is why they are in the streets, not because they want to expose themselves to coronavirus. But they've reached a level of desperation where they're no longer believing society's ability to protect them from a virus or from the virus or police abuse. GROSS: Were you glad over the weekend that you are no longer a police officer? ADAMS: No, not at all. I looked forward to being in the eye of the storm. I looked forward to those difficult days when I had to talk someone down from showing a level of anger and understanding what they felt. I was the type of person that I wanted to be the platoon commander that was inside of - in charge of the detail that went out. I knew we were going to allow officers to come back safely. And I knew that the protesters were going to get home safe. And that's the type of leadership we need right now. And I think that in the police department, we have some amazing men and women who have taken upon this occupation. We need to start rewarding them for their commitment - and not only looking at how good they are at fighting crime, but how good they are at building relationships within the community. GROSS: Eric Adams, thank you so much for talking with us. And I hope Brooklyn comes through all of this OK. ADAMS: OK. Be well. GROSS: Eric Adams is the Brooklyn borough president and a former NYPD police captain. He co-founded the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care.

Protests have erupted in dozens of cities over the past week since Floyd, a black man, died after a police officer was seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck for minutes on end. ""I think the public is getting to a place that it's never been before in understanding a lot of this,"" Biden said at the event. ""But it's going to take a whole hell of a lot of hard work. A lot of hard work. But I'm confident it can be done."" Fourteen faith leaders and local lawmakers attended the event at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Del., as they donned masks and sat seated two to a pew to help maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus. Biden spent more than half of the event listening to the concerns of community leaders rather than delivering remarks. He could be seen taking notes as each attendee got up and spoke. Despite being in a room full of supporters, the group offered critical feedback to the former vice president, with some saying the black community didn't get the economic boost it needed under the Obama administration and that Biden's role in passing the 1994 crime bill makes some young black voters skeptical of him. There were recommendations to create a czar dedicated solely to the study of police brutality within Biden's first 100 days as president. Several speakers urged Biden to pick an African American woman as his vice president. U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., spoke emotionally of a recent exchange she had with a 23-year-old protester in Wilmington, who told her he was ""willing to die."" ""He said, 'I have so much rage.' And I said, 'How old are you? What's your name? How old are you?' And I just tried to hold him, COVID or not,"" the congresswoman said. After about an hour, Biden rose to address the church gathering. ""I want to make something clear: I don't expect anything from the black community,"" he said. ""It has to be earned, earned every single time."" Biden said he's spent time speaking with black thought leaders about how to move forward as a country and said people who ""don't think of themselves as having a prejudiced bone in their body"" are now reckoning with the discrimination endemic in some American institutions. ""The Band-Aid's been ripped off by this pandemic and this president. No one can pretend any longer what this is all about. Nobody can pretend who has been carrying us on our backs — it's the minorities,"" Biden said. Biden listed specific plans for his would-be administration, including heightened federal oversight over local law enforcement, additional training for police officers and increased economic opportunity for African Americans. He teased the announcement of a new economic proposal in the coming weeks, which he said will have a strong emphasis on housing, education and access to capital. ""The ultimate answer for every other group has been access to economic opportunity,"" Biden said. ""What is the future? The future is you gotta be able to get out of bed and think, 'I can make it, I can do something. The deck's not completely stacked.' "" He also stressed what he characterized as a critical need to change leadership in the Senate, particularly as it relates to confirming federal judges. ""If we don't win back the United States Senate, we're going to be in real trouble,"" Biden said. ""Presidents come and go. But I tell you what, justices don't. They last a long time."" The event ended with a prayer and Biden saying he'll rely on the group for advice throughout his campaign. ""I know I'm going to make mistakes,"" he said before quoting the expression, ""What comes from the heart goes straight to the heart."" ""It's going to come from the heart. But I'll need help,"" the former vice president said. ""I need help and advice as we go along as to what you think I should and shouldn't be doing."" The event marked Biden's third public appearance in a week, his first trips away from his home since mid-March. He has been campaigning from his house due to coronavirus lockdown orders. Biden left his home on Memorial Day to lay a wreath at a veterans park near his home, and on Sunday he visited a site in Wilmington where protesters had gathered the night before in response to Floyd's death.

Barr has directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to dispatch riot teams to the nation's capital and to Miami to assist local authorities in responding to protests there, according to a senior Justice Department official. The attorney general also sent an FBI hostage rescue team to help authorities Sunday in Washington with demonstrations, the official said, adding that the federal law enforcement presence will be ""maximized"" in the city on Monday evening. The moves come as protesters continue to take to the streets in cities across the country in outrage and grief over Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis while in police custody. Video of Floyd's arrest shows him handcuffed and pinned facedown on the street. A Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, is shown kneeling on top of him with his knee pushing on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Barr has called the outrage over Floyd's death ""real and legitimate"" but said the criminal justice system must be the venue to hold those responsible to account. And he argues that is already happening. Chauvin and three other officers involved have been fired from the police force. Minnesota authorities also have charged Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter. On a parallel track, the FBI and Justice Department are conducting a separate investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated. Some of the protests against Floyd's death have turned violent and destructive. Shops in Washington, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and elsewhere have been looted, burned and destroyed. Police stations and police vehicles have been attacked. It is unclear at this point who exactly is behind the violence, but Barr and President Trump put the blame squarely on what they have labeled far-left radicals and extremists. ""Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements,"" Barr said over the weekend. ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda."" He said that in many places, the violence appears to be driven by ""anarchistic and far-left extremists, using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence."" It is unclear what Barr meant by ""antifa-like tactics,"" and he did not offer any evidence to support his assertions. A Justice Department official later said it was based on information provided by state and local authorities. On Sunday, the president went a step further and threatened to designate antifa a terrorist group, although experts said there is no legal authority that allows a domestic entity to be labeled a ""terrorist organization."" On top of that, antifa, short for anti-fascist, isn't an organization but rather a diffuse movement of activists on the far left. While Barr and Trump have put the blame on them, some state authorities, such as Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, have blamed white nationalists. He, too, did not offer evidence to support his assertion. For now, state and local police and other authorities are leading the law enforcement response to the protests. They make the arrests, although the FBI is conducting interviews to determine whether any federal laws — such as crossing state lines to conduct violence —have been violated. ",0.0

Police have cited concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. The rally has been held each year since 1990 to commemorate the lives lost in the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The Chinese military opened fire on citizens who were calling for economic and democratic reforms. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil, told the South China Morning Post that alliance members still planned to enter Victoria Park to observe a moment of silence that night. The alliance also asked the public to join an online gathering and light candles across the city. NPR's Emily Feng reported that the move to deny the demonstration comes amid controversy surrounding China's proposed national security law that could limit Hong Kong's autonomy. The potential law has concerned pro-democracy advocates, and as Feng noted, ""Legal scholars question whether Beijing has the authority to impose this law on Hong Kong."" In justifying an earlier extension of restrictions to June 4, police cited a lingering threat of the spread of the coronavirus, The Guardian reported. ""Police believe the event will not only increase participants' chances of contracting the virus, but also threaten citizens' lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others,"" police said, according to the newspaper. Lee Cheuk-yan, who chairs the alliance that organized the event, told the South China Morning Post that he believes the government was using the pandemic to shut down the demonstration. ""We believe this is totally unreasonable and unscientific, because everything is normal in Hong Kong. They are just using this excuse to suppress our rally,"" he said, adding that many other facilities had already reopened. ",0.0

But some health experts, even as they urge caution, said they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat. Tens of thousands of people, masked and unmasked, have thronged the streets of Minneapolis, Atlanta, Louisville, Ky., and other cities in the week since George Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. They are the largest public gatherings in the U.S. since the pandemic forced widespread shutdowns, and many local officials warned of a possible spike in new cases in one or two weeks. ""Risk of transmission is lower in open spaces, but wherever there is a gathering there is still the risk of transmitting the virus,"" said Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. Health experts urged protesters not to sing and shout to reduce the threat of person-to-person transmission. And they cautioned that police tactics such as tear gas and pepper spray could exacerbate the situation by prompting people to cough and gasp for air. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a list of tips for demonstrators to lower their risk of contracting COVID-19, such as covering their faces and staying in small groups. ""Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead,"" the department advised. Nsoesie said that while she agrees with the sentiment, ""I can see how some of these tips can be difficult to follow. For example, if you are angry or frustrated about an issue, you want to express that feeling, and speaking is one way of doing that."" She added, ""It's also hard to keep 6 feet of distance at a protest."" Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she's worried about how consecutive days of protests could trigger an influx of COVID-19 cases. Huge demonstrations began in the nation's capital on Friday — the same day Bowser lifted stay-at-home orders and eased shutdown rules. The city is still limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people. But in the streets around the White House, that cap is regularly exceeded by orders of magnitude. ""I'm so concerned about it that I'm urging everybody to consider their exposure if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested, because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve,"" Bowser said on NBC's Meet the Press. But the risks of congregating during a global pandemic shouldn't keep people from protesting racism, according to dozens of public health and disease experts who signed an open letter in support of the protests. ""White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,"" the letter said. Initially written by infectious disease experts at the University of Washington, the letter cited a number of systemic problems, from the disproportionately high rate at which black people have been killed by police in the U.S. to disparities in life expectancy and other vital categories — including black Americans' higher death rate from the coronavirus. ""Data is showing that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in many states,"" said Nsoesie, who was not among the letter's signatories when NPR contacted her. ""Racism is one of the reasons this disparity exists."" She continued, ""Racism is a social determinant of health. It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn't weigh these crises separately."" Local governments should not break up crowded demonstrations ""under the guise of maintaining public health,"" the experts said in their open letter. They urged law enforcement agencies not to use tear gas, smoke and other irritants, saying they could make people more susceptible to infection and worsen existing health conditions. The medical professionals also acknowledged the potential for COVID-19 cases to rise in the days to come, and they called for public health agencies to boost access to care and testing in affected communities.

Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One — Derek Chauvin — has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits."" : 6/03/20 A previous version of this Web story incorrectly said all four police officers present at the death of George Floyd are white. Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. AILSA CHANG, HOST: The viral video that sparked nationwide protests this weekend captured an individual tragedy - the death of a black man at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. But George Floyd's death is set against a backdrop of economic inequality that has long shadowed race relations in this country. We're going to talk about that now for a few minutes with NPR's Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So we've been hearing an enormous amount of frustration in the last week about yet another black man dying in police custody. Can you just break down for us how economics plays into that frustration? HORSLEY: There is certainly frustration with the deadly tactics of police. But there's also frustration about the underlying circumstances that in the richest country on Earth, a man could lose his life because he's suspected of passing a counterfeit 20-dollar bill. We know that African Americans are worse off than whites in this country by almost every economic measure. Andre Perry, who studies race and inequality at the Brookings Institution, says that means blacks in general are more vulnerable to any kind of economic downturn. ANDRE PERRY: Black folk live in communities where a single economic shock can really send the entire economic hopes astray. HORSLEY: And, of course, right now, we're all living through a giant economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. CHANG: Right. HORSLEY: People throughout the country are on edge. And that has just added more dry kindling to the woodpile where this match has landed. CHANG: Well, about the pandemic - I mean, we know that African Americans have suffered disproportionate health problems during this entire outbreak. But economically, how are they faring, relatively speaking, during this time? HORSLEY: Not well. Of course, workers of all races have seen a spike in unemployment during the pandemic. The black unemployment rate has jumped into double digits, as have other rates. But the black-white gap hasn't gotten noticeably worse during the last couple of months. CHANG: Interesting. HORSLEY: We do know, however, African Americans who are working are more likely to be in essential frontline jobs. And that puts them at greater risk of infection. CHANG: So how does Minneapolis, where this all started, stack up when it comes to inequality or when it comes to discrimination? HORSLEY: The racial divide in Minneapolis is pretty stark both in terms of income and homeownership. In fact, the gap between white and black homeownership in Minneapolis is one of the largest in the country. And that matters because for a lot of families, owning a home is the main building block of wealth and stability. If blacks aren't able to buy homes, they're missing out on an important stepping stone. Nationwide, African Americans did make some gains in homeownership in the '90s and early 2000s. But those were really wiped out by the subprime mortgage crisis. And Andre Perry says that kind of structural inequality feeds into the frustration of the people who are protesting George Floyd's death. PERRY: That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters. It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities. HORSLEY: Now, Perry notes these demonstrations are taking place five months before a national election. And he says this is a good opportunity for policymakers to talk about how they see policing and how they would address these longstanding economic challenges. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

During a press conference on Monday morning, O’Connor and Frederick Police Department Acting Chief Patrick Grossman said they are united with protesters across the country outraged by the killing of George Floyd after Minneapolis Police officers restrained him. “We are dismayed and angered by the wanton disregard for human life seen in the recent deaths of so many people of color including George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor,” O’Connor explained, “We join those in our community calling for justice.” Grossman called out officers in the video and said their tactical response went against proper police training. “To the case in point of the actions that were observed on a video in Minneapolis, we’d just like to point out is a direct violation in contracting to our existing general order,” Grossman said. Frederick Police officers reviewed the video of officers restraining Floyd as an example of poor police action. Now the city and police officers are supporting a local protest even as permits for large gatherings are unavailable at this time. “A delicate balance has to be maintained between the permitting process for a parade and a safe expression of first amendment liberties,” Grossman said. A protest, organized over social media, is scheduled to begin on Friday at 4:30 p.m. at Mullinix Park. And in the days after, O’Connor pledges additional community conversations. “We need to open up a dialogue like we’ve done before and we need to find a way to move the conversation in directions it’s never moved before because enough is enough,” said O’Connor.

(WDVM) — COVID-19 has been challenging for many people, especially for those who need constant medical supplies. Fahrney Keedy Home and Village has been a part of the Boonsboro community for years. The family oriented staff works hard to keep their residents safe, so when the pandemic began, they wanted to ensure the upkeep of their supplies to keep their residents healthy. Many staff members worked together to come up with creative ideas to ensure everyone had masks everyday. But even with a decent stock piled up, they still needed more. “We have a hundred thirty something residents, and we’re constantly going through multiple sets of PPE, everyday, so we’re using a lot, so anything helps and is much appreciated,” said delegating registered nurse Melanie Bishoff. Downsville Church of the Brethren became aware of the need for masks at the living facility. Members of the church came together with the help of Modern Woodmen of America, a community service organization. Both groups worked together to show their support by making over one hundred mask for the workers and residents. “To take these mask and hand to people that I know will need them, is great. It definitely opens your eyes, about what’s happening, because I don’t really see what’s happening at the nursing homes, but being able to talk to people that work there, and interact with them, makes me realize that it’s a dire necessity for them to have mask these days” said youth group member Nichola Maynard Although there’s been some obstacles, the staff at Fahrney Keedy Home and Village make it their mission to keep residents safe and with the help from community member they remain positive.

Other local shops (below) also were boarded up the day before a scheduled protest, which will be at Bethesda Library at 1 p.m. Tuesday. Photos by Matt McDonald Some Bethesda Row merchants were boarding up their businesses this week as they anticipate a peaceful protest on Tuesday — and whatever might happen that isn’t planned. Bethesda is the latest place scheduled to hold a protest over the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis. A white police officer investigating a call about someone using a fake $20 bill at a store pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck on the ground for several minutes, as shown in a video shot by a bystander. The officer has been charged with murder and manslaughter. A peaceful protest in response to Floyd’s death and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement is planned in Bethesda at 1 p.m. Tuesday in front of Bethesda Library at 7400 Arlington Road. Montgomery County police Second District Commander Sean Gagen, whose district includes Bethesda, wrote in a message to the Greater Bethesda Chamber of Commerce on Monday that he contacted a student organizer to discuss the protest and assure organizers that they are free to protest peacefully. “Police officers from the Montgomery County Police Department 2nd District and I will be at the Bethesda Library throughout the protest and there will be an increased police presence throughout the Bethesda Central Business District over the course of the protest,” Gagen wrote. Gagen added that businesses and others in the community should be aware of the increased number of officers in Bethesda’s central business district. In an interview Monday afternoon, Gagen said that there would be a “large presence” of officers throughout the Second District for the “foreseeable future.” “Out of an overabundance of caution, businesses are taking it upon themselves to protect their property. We plan on having an increased presence with our police officers down in the CBD (central business district) in Friendship Heights area and throughout the commercial establishments in the district,” he said. “So people should see a larger number of police cars than they normally would. But that’s us being proactive.” There have been days of protests in Washington, D.C., and cities across the country over Floyd’s death. In some cases, there have been confrontations between protesters and police. Some tense protests have devolved into rioting and looting. One example was in Friendship Heights in D.C. on Sunday night, at the Maryland-D.C. line. Rioters looted several businesses, including the Mazza Gallerie shopping mall on the D.C. side. Montgomery County police lined up to keep rioters out of the county. Gagen said on Monday that about 50 Montgomery County officers were at the scene on Sunday night. The officers included a mix of uniformed officers and others in riot gear from the department’s Special Events Response Team, or SERT. Gagen said he didn’t know of any violent protests expected Monday evening. John Fitzgerald, the chief of the Chevy Chase Village Police Department, near Friendship Heights, wrote in a statement Monday that he had communicated with both Montgomery County and D.C. police about planning for more possible protests. “Rest assured that Chevy Chase Village officers will be actively on patrol and monitoring the streets along the DC line, and the County Police will be sending multiple officers into the area as evening approaches to deter and respond to any criminal activity that might arise,” he wrote. Carolyn Weinberg, a part-owner of Quartermaine Coffee Roasters at 4817 Bethesda Ave., said in an interview Monday that her businesses would be boarded up starting at 4 p.m. “We’ve been watching the news and what’s happening in D.C. and many of us in Bethesda don’t want our businesses damaged, so we’re taking every precaution we can,” she said. Weinberg said her business will be open Tuesday morning, then will close when the protest starts. “We’ll close at 1, put the boards up and hope for the best,” she said. Weinberg said the nighttime protests that are violent are what she is worried about the most. “Mazza Gallerie is literally seven minutes from us. Not even,” she said, referring to Sunday night’s looting in Friendship Heights. The owner of Pampillonia Jewelers, at 7114 Bethesda Lane, also boarded up the storefront on Monday afternoon. A representative of the store said that even though everything is in a vault, large windows could get broken if protests get violent. “We’re just taking precautions, that’s all,” she said. Someone who identified herself as one of the organizers of the protest wrote in an email to Bethesda Beat on Monday morning that it will be peaceful and an important way to raise awareness. “We can no longer sit by and watch innocent black lives being taken,” she wrote. She had not responded as of Monday evening to an email seeking comment. Dan Schere can be reached at Daniel.schere@bethesdamagazine.com",0.0

Floyd, who was black, died on May 25 after a white police officer investigating a call about someone using a fake $20 bill at a store pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes, as shown in a video shot by a bystander. The officer has been charged with murder and manslaughter. Floyd’s death has sparked protests and violent confrontations in many cities. Col. Zadok A. Magruder High School student Nicole Badobre said she helped organize a peaceful protest in Gaithersburg on Monday as a way for students to have a platform. “I wanted to do this because I felt like none of our voices were being heard,” Badobre said. Around 200 students were there for a march that started at Rio and moved through Gaithersburg. They stopped in major intersections to chant “Black Lives Matter” and “No justice, no peace.” They also chanted “Say their names,” then would list the names of black people killed by police. The Target department store was closed in anticipation of the demonstration, police said. During their march, as the group chanted “Black Lives Matter,” a white man called out to the group, “All lives matter.” This turned into a confrontation between the man and the students. Police who were on hand got involved and got between the man and the students. As the group chanted “black lives matter” behind her, Badobre spoke to the man: “When we say black lives matter, all lives matter is a way to discredit everything that we’ve been through in this country.” The incident was brief and was resolved without incident. In contrast, nearby residents clapped for the protesters from their balconies and porches. Some raised their fists in support. Several times, the crowd walked through stopped traffic and were greeted with honks of support. One car turned up its music and the crowd gathered around and cheered. The protest followed a peaceful demonstration in Germantown on Sunday afternoon. Other protests are planned in Bethesda on Tuesday and Rockville on Friday. The Gaithersburg event was still underway three hours after it started.",0.0
1622711239,2020-06-01 19:01:00,USC Professor On How Protests Have Changed Since LA Riots In 1992,https://www.wypr.org/post/usc-professor-how-protests-have-changed-la-riots-1992,en,False,,245165,wypr.org,http://wypr.org/,"Looting, fires, vandalism and the National Guard on the streets — for many, the unrest of 2020 evokes memories of the destructive riots of 1992 in Los Angeles. Both times the protests began in anger over police violence against black men — in 1992, when four police officers were acquitted of the brutal beating of Rodney King; now, when George Floyd died in Minnesota after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. ""We keep telling ourselves that somehow technology or training will end police misconduct,"" says Jody David Armour, a law professor who studies the intersection of race and the criminal justice system. ""But in this case, we saw that in Minnesota, the police department did a lot of that stuff. And still here we are."" Armour, who has taught at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles since 1995, talked with All Things Considered about how protests have changed in the 28 years since the Rodney King riots. Interview Highlights On the people who are protesting now vs. in 1992 The protests and marches today you see are multiethnic, multicultural, even multigenerational. And the allyship is something that is more pronounced now than it perhaps once was. I think a lot of people, when they saw that video of George Floyd, who weren't in the black community, felt agony. And I think this time around, more people feel that sympathy and empathy for members of the black community and are standing in solidarity with them. On empathy for Rodney King vs. George Floyd I think at the time of the Rodney King beating it was easier to view it as an isolated incident or as a few bad apples. But now, over time, we see a persistent and pervasive pattern. Over years and years. We see Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, 25-year-old black man jogging and is shot dead. Two prosecutors look at the facts and don't bring any action. Breonna Taylor in Louisville. No-knock raid, wrong house; she's killed. The procession of hashtags that made up the Black Lives Matter movement in the 2014, 2015, 2016 years. I think more and more people are seeing that it isn't just isolated incidents, that there's something more pervasive and more ingrained in America that we have to address. The police officer's knee on the neck of George Floyd for many was a grim symbol of, kind of, America's knee on the neck of black America. On where broader protests go from here My sense of where the protests can go from here, hopefully will go from here, is we'll have a serious reckoning with the racial injustice that has really provoked and continues to provoke these kinds of eruptions. This is this really kind of a generational upheaval. We can either make some serious structural changes, redistribute power and wealth in a way that we haven't been willing to consider in the past. I think more people are willing to consider things like, even just as a result of the coronavirus crisis, things like universal basic income and ""Medicare for All."" I think that as a result of this other kind of crisis — I think that racism is a kind of virus, too, that mutates and changes from time to time, but continues to persist — that we will take on the necessary work of redistributing wealth and power in such a way that we don't have Skid Rows, 75% of which have black faces in them. That we don't make the faces at the bottom of the well always black faces. And we do start to act as a society like black lives matter.

WJZ COMPLETE COVERAGE: George Floyd’s Death And Its Impacts In Maryland The full statement reads: “There is nothing I can say to ease the pain felt by African-American communities across our country. No words will repair the damage that has been done. “Like many people, I am sickened, disheartened and shaken by the acts of racism that continue to overwhelm our society. The most recent killing, involving George Floyd, is yet another tragic example of the discrimination that African-Americans face each day. “Now, more than ever, we must all strengthen our pursuit of positive change, as we stand with peaceful protestors around the country. We must all seek to understand by listening better and learning more. We must all discover new ways to unite. We must all work to break the cycle of systematic racial injustice. “Our players have been – and will continue to be – at the forefront of this change. We believe in their commitment to furthering social justice and invoking meaningful change. We stand side by side with them, in full support. It is for this reason that I have asked a group of former and current Ravens players to decide which organizations should receive proceeds from the $1 million donation we are making today.” Read the latest coverage of the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis from WCCO-TV | CBS Minnesota.",0.0

Barr released a statement explaining that he has directed federal law enforcement actions aimed at apprehending and charging the violent criminal agitators who have taken over peaceful protests and are engaging in violations of federal law. According to the statement, The U.S. Attorneys from the Northern and Southern Districts of West Virginia, along with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are employing the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) to identify criminal organizers and instigators, coordinating federal resources with state and local partners, and seeking federal prosecutions where applicable. “The death of George Floyd understandably caused outrage and protests. Our democracy was built upon the exercise of free speech. I am proud of our West Virginia citizens who chose to congregate in peaceful demonstrations. Please allow those peaceful protests and constructive dialogue be an example to the rest of the nation. Some have chosen to act with violence and endanger their fellow citizens and law enforcement. Such criminal conduct does nothing to further the issues surrounding the death of George Floyd and will not be tolerated by law enforcement or the citizens of our state. We will continue to monitor the situation, but are prepared to act immediately to enforce the rule of law,” said U.S. Attorney Bill Powell, Northern District of West Virginia. United States Attorney Mike Stuart released this statements about the violence and looting that is happening in protests. “Let me be clear- this is a nation grounded in the right to protest. This nation is also grounded in the rule of law,” said Stuart. “The right to protest is not a right to loot, riot, commit property destruction or to engage in or incite violence. It is wholly unacceptable and it defies those who protest peacefully. Peaceful protest can be powerful. Violence, looting and criminal behavior undermines the cause and, if it happens in West Virginia, we will enforce the rule of law.” Other officials, such as FBI Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge, Mike Christman added to the response of the violence happening at protests. “The FBI is dedicated to upholding the Constitution, including protecting all citizens’ rights to peacefully protest,” said FBI Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Mike Christman. “The FBI respects the rights of individuals to peacefully exercise their First Amendment rights, but when people abuse those rights to invoke violence, federal law will be enforced.

They want to shoot us… They want to arrest us… Sit us down and ask questions… They just assume we do something because you see us in the streets.” Montgomery County Department of Police, Chief of Police, Marcus Jones released a statement Monday in regards to the death of George Floyd, he wrote: “I was saddened and angered to watch the video circulated recently which depicted the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. To watch a person’s life be slowly and callously taken away before our very eyes shakes the core of committed and dedicated police officers. I am also frustrated. I am frustrated because I know this incident will be a brush by which our entire profession will be painted and it was an inhumane act. The acts of these officers in Minneapolis are not representative of our profession and they are certainly not representative of the values of our department as a whole.” “Myself, and the rest of the Montgomery County Department of Police, stand with those seeking peaceful discourse at the local and national level on race relations, policing and reform.” Two more peaceful protests are scheduled for this week in Montgomery County. One will be held in Bethesda on Tuesday, June 2nd at 1 p.m. A second one is scheduled for Friday, June 5th at 1 p.m. outside of the Montgomery County Circuit Court.",0.0

My fellow Americans, my first and highest duty as president, is to defend our great country and the American people. I sworn oath to uphold the laws of our nation, and that is exactly what I will do. All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that for George and his family justice will be served. He will not have died in vain, but we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protesters to be drown out by an angry mob. The biggest victims off the rioting are peace loving citizens in our poorest communities. And is there President? I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you. I am your president of Law and Order and an ally of all peaceful protesters. But in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, riders, antifa and others. A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents. Innocent people have been savagely beaten, like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street or the woman in upstate New York viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed. New York's finest have been hit in the face with bricks. Brave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct has been overrun. Here in the nation's capital, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War Two Memorial has been vandalized. One of our most historic churches was set ablaze. A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero, was shot and killed. These air not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against God. America needs creation, not destruction. Cooperation, not contempt. Security, not anarchy. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos. This is our mission, and we will succeed 100%. We will succeed. Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America. I am mobilizing all available Federal resource is civilian and military to stop the rioting and looting to end the destruction and arson and to protect the rights of law abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights. Therefore, the following measures air going into effect immediately. First, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now. Today. I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard insufficient numbers that we dominate the streets. Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington, D. C. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement offices to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property. We're putting everybody on warning are seven oclock curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I want the organizer's of this terror to be unnoticed, that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail. This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence. One law and order and that is what it is. One law. We have one beautiful law and once that is restored and fully restored, we will help you. We will help your business and we will help your family. America is founded upon the rule of law. It is the foundation of our prosperity, our freedom and our very way of life. But where there is no law, there is no opportunity where there is no justice, there is no liberty. Where there is no safety, there is no future. We must never given to anger or hatred. If malice or violence reigns that none of us is free. I take these actions today with firm resolve and with a true and passionate love for our country. By far our greatest days. Lie ahead. Thank you very much. And now I'm going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. Thank you very much. Advertisement GOP senators critical of President Trump's response to unrest following Floyd's death Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: President Trump vows to deploy U.S. military if states can't control violent protestsTop GOP senators are calling on President Donald Trump to take a far more compassionate approach amid the deep unrest following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, raising concerns that the president's handling of the crisis so far threatens to divide a badly bruised nation further.""I think the country is definitely looking for healing and for calm, and I think that's the tone the president needs to project when talking about what is happening around the country,"" Senate Majority Whip John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, told CNN. ""I think he needs to strike a tone that fits the level of frustration country's experiencing right now, and I hope in the future, he'll do that.""Thune added that Trump's tweets about the situation have been ""not helpful.""Sen. John Cornyn, also a member of Senate GOP leadership, told CNN that ""I think it's important"" for Trump to offer more of a unifying message in the midst of the deep unrest across the county.""I presume at some point he will address the nation,"" said Cornyn of Texas. ""If I were advising him I would say we need it sooner rather than later.""At a time when Trump could be consoling the nation, Republicans — who rarely break from Trump — are voicing their disapproval that the president has offered little in the way of condolences and instead taken to Twitter to incite divisions and cast blame.""Some of his tweets have not been helpful,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said at a news conference Monday. ""It would be helpful if he would change the tone of his message.""The message from his own party comes as protests have grown and spread throughout the country from Los Angeles to Washington.""We are obviously in a divisive situation right now that is escalating. ... He needs to make more unifying comments,"" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia.Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, speaking on the Senate floor, called on Trump ""to help heal the racial division.""""The president should help to heal the racial divisions in this country,"" Collins said. ""It is at times like this that a president needs to speak to the nation, to pledge to right wrongs and to calm inflamed passions.""Asked later if she thinks the president needs to offer a unifying message, Collins said: ""I do.""Sen. Cory Gardner, who like Collins is facing reelection next year, didn't criticize Trump directly but added: ""We all have to do better every day — we have to.""On Friday, the president's handling of the situation came under more scrutiny after he tweeted, ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase that originated from controversial Miami police chief Walter Headley at the height of the civil rights movement. Headley, who defended practices like using police dogs and force, said at news conference ""We don't mind being accused of police brutality,"" according to an article from the period in The New York Times.""Those are not constructive tweets without any question,"" Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate, told Fox on Sunday. ""I will say this, I spoke with the president (Saturday) morning, and he and I had a good conversation about the next steps. I told him, what I am going to tell you. I told him 'Mr. President, it helps us when you focus on the death, the unjustified in my opinion, the criminal death of George Floyd.'""On Monday during a private call with governors, the president continued to blast others for what has unfolded, accusing some states of being weak and arguing that law enforcement needed to ""dominate"" protestors in order to contain the demonstrations in cities across the country.""You have to dominate or you'll look like a bunch of jerks, you have to arrest and try people,"" the president told the governors in a call from the basement White House Situation Room, according to an audio recording of the call obtained by CNN.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn't answer questions Monday about whether he believed Trump had struck the appropriate tone in his handling of the unrest. Others also declined to comment about Trump's tweets, including Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, who faces voters in the fall.""Well, obviously this is an evolving situation — I think this is a difficult position the president is in,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida when asked if Trump should shift his tone to emphasize unity. On Monday, McConnell demonstrated a starkly different tone from the president from the floor of the Senate.""In no world, whatsoever, should arresting a man for an alleged minor infraction involve a police officer putting his knee on a man's neck for nine minutes while he cries out 'I can't breathe' and then goes silent,"" McConnell said. ""To me, to a great many of my fellow Kentuckians and to many outraged Americans, these disturbing events do not look like three isolated incidents, they look more like the latest chapter in our national struggle to make equal justice and equal protection of the law into facts of life for all Americans.""",0.0

Protesters tell 47ABC that even though the event was cancelled, they still felt the need to show their support. “Black lives matter. We cannot let the injustices that are going on in the nation today go on. We have to speak out and we have to speak for them,” said peaceful protester Jehan Riar. The bandstand hosted a group of dozens calling for justice for George Floyd. Protesters at the rally say they wanted to stand in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. “Enough is enough. I think everybody should come down here anyone who is protesting. Go to them. They’re showing that they can take a stand to this,” said peaceful protester Angela. Some protestors brought their children with them. Riar says she wants to set an example for her daughters. “I want them to know that they can stand up for their rights. If they see their parents doing that, that’s modeling right? So I want them to see that this is something they should do if it is a protest that is peaceful – that is allowing everyone to come out and speak for what they believe for,” said Riar. Down the street – some businesses could be seen boarding up windows. They tell 47ABC that they support the protesters, but don’t want to take any chances when it comes to looting. Protesters tell us that while they understand the business owners’ fears, not enough is being done when it comes to making change. “People have kneeled. People have silently protested, and anger will build up, and there will be a time when it comes out in unhealthy ways. This is because people have not been taught how to healthily cope with anger, and that’s nobody’s fault but the systemic injustice of racism in this country,” said Riar. Another protest is slated to happen here in Rehoboth Beach on June 4th. Friday’s protest is being organized by Southern Delaware Alliance for Racial Justice. During that protest, people are expected to gather along Route 1 for a vigil.",0.0

Tanner, a social worker who supports LGBT families experiencing homelessness, said the ceremony — hosted by Jewish Community Action, a local social justice group, Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, a national organization and Edot Midwest Regional Jewish Diversity Collaborative — conveyed a powerful message for black Jews like him. “As the Jewish community reaches in and says how do we support their cause and how do we support the black community, it’s really important that people reach in to black Jews and other Jews of color and realize that we’re here,” Tanner said. “And we need our community.” We reached out to black Jews like Tanner to understand their feelings at this wrenching moment and what their message is for the broader Jewish community. Here’s what they told us. Answers have been lightly edited for length and clarity. April Baskin is a diversity consultant and racial justice director of the Jewish Social Justice Roundtable. Personally in terms of my energy right now, I’m just exhausted. Just seeing all the suffering particularly in light of the people going out into the streets without a plan or adequate protections in place (friends, march marshalls, legal aid contact info, etc.), the poignancy of people whose politics otherwise have them mostly sheltering in place during the worst pandemic we’ve seen in over a hundred years, that they are compelled to take action — at their and our own peril. But it seems their thought is, “How can we not stand up?” As a Jewish social justice leader, I have a visceral, fundamental concern for people’s well-being in this moment — that people are very triggered and that this is all in the context of pre-existing heightened anxiety and stress because of the pandemic. And for black folks, whether it’s conscious or not, the sense of terror we feel for when is the shoe going to drop for someone we know, someone in our town, for us? I am experiencing more white Jews sending me private messages. A lot of them are saying “What can we do?” and in time I hope we can advance our collective knowledge and education enough so it can become more of “I’ve been proactively learning from people of color and here is what I am doing,” or “These are the things I’m considering. I’m mostly leaning towards this one, does that sound like it’s in alignment with your vision?” That said, it’s a step forward and it’s good, but it’s asking more of us as Jews of color to not only figure out how to maintain our jobs and do additional leadership and activism in this moment, but then also being asked to support and manage white Jews’ work during a time in which many of us are traumatized and heartbroken. But this is progress, and I would rather people reach out, however they best know how, than apathy and not doing anything or paralysis from fear. Ginna Green works in the Jewish community and the progressive movement, and sits on the boards of the Jews of Color Initiative, the Jewish Social Justice Roundtable, and Political Research Associates. The current moment, for me, is one of numbness. I rejoined the rest of the world in grief and rage a little bit late, as I was scrambling toward Shavuos as things in Minneapolis and all over were reaching a flashpoint on Thursday. I went into lighting candles that evening with a sense of weight and trepidation, because I did not know what would be true come motzei Shabbat two days later. I was on edge the entire chag. Listening to my 16-year-old black Jewish son leyn Megillat Ruth and playing Shavuot Spot-It with my 5-year-old daughter brought me moments of joy, but not enough to ease my spirit. I knew it would come, but how I had not imagined. I am deeply appreciative of the fact that when Shavuos ended, I was overwhelmed by texts from white folks — Jewish and not — offering support, and checking in. The last several days have been exhausting, but the truth is that the last five years have been exhausting, and the last 400 years have been exhausting. Every black person is tired. What I need from white Jews and white people is yes, please keep calling, keep texting and asking how I am, and all the other black people you know. And also call and text your fellow white Jews and people: Ask them what they did today to dismantle white supremacy. Give them three places to donate, three black people to learn from; three new classes to take or books to read. The work of beating back the white supremacy is a burden that can’t be left to black folks. We all need all of us. And every black person is tired. I also want to see the Jewish community embrace radical possibility. A month ago, folks were pointing out the major change a pandemic had made possible. Radical shifts in work. Expectations. Air quality. But racism has been an American epidemic for 400 years, and it is against the backdrop of this transformational pandemic — and one that is taking black lives disproportionately — that we see the grief and rage and impact reach epic proportions. And there are solutions of varying radicalness that black folks have been proposing for years to right the systemic wrongs of a nation that black people built: reparations; universal basic income; mass decarceration; defunding police. Hammers and nails won’t be enough to build what must come next for us all to thrive — we need bulldozers and forklifts. Embrace the radical possibility, and help make it true. At the risk of belying the danger and concern and fear and worry that are real and present, I am also hopeful. The United States is breaking, painfully, visibly but not irreparably. The cracks have always been there for us to study. Perhaps now we can create the place that holds us all. Yitz Jordan is the founder of TribeHerald, a publication for Jews of color, and a hip hop artist also known as Y-Love. What am I feeling? Anxiety. That’s what I’m feeling. I had an anxiety attack on Friday. I live in the ‘hood, I live in Bushwick, so I’m not really geographically in the Jewish community, but I know that somebody on Friday for instance was shot not too far from me and I was terrified as to what the response to that was going to be, were cops going to respond and was rioting going to happen in my neighborhood? And in the Jewish community, this is the kind of fight that I’m having: “This didn’t happen after the Holocaust, why are black people acting like this?” It’s that role of explaining over and over again to people who quite often don’t want to listen. I feel like there’s the same split that’s going through America in ideological lines, is going through the Jewish community … whatever percent of Orthodox Jews that support Trump, you see it more from these people. When we say the Jewish community in general that also consists of people like JFREJ [Jews for Racial and Economic Justice] and Jewish Voice for Peace and these other organizations, but in the Orthodox world, the pro-Trump wing is where I’m hearing these types of conversations. And I’m seeing this, ranging from lack of knowledge to callousness regarding people of color. There are some people who genuinely don’t know, and to whom a lot of these issues are very new. Especially Hasidish people, for instance, this just isn’t part of the Shabbos-table conversation — police brutality, inequality, systemic racism. But you have some people who just show callousness. Gulienne Rishon is a diversity expert and chief revenue officer for TribeHerald Media. I am thankful for true allies, who understand that this is not the time to center their own experiences. I am thankful for true allies, who understand that the experiences they and their ancestors have had are to be used in this moment as empathy, and that no one is denying them their experiences in asking them to listen and learn. But mostly, if one more white-presenting Jew tries to tell me today that they don’t have white privilege (not that they aren’t White, but that they don’t have white privilege) because they’re Jewish/the Holocaust/Jews got kicked out of schools, I might lose my mind. I should not have to deal with people telling me that my story (the Black part) doesn’t exist because my story (the Ashkenazi experience) exists. But I do. And I am confident that part of why G-d put me in the skin of a biracial Jewish woman descended from a kindertransport survivor, a WWII veteran who was kicked out of his Hamburg Gymnasium for being Jewish, and two Southern Black Virginians, is to help us as a people face our sinat chinam and take responsibility for being the light unto the nations by helping, not closing our ranks and denying the pain others feel because of the freshness of ours. Facilitating difficult conversations about race is literally my profession. Yet, some days, I’m just a person behind a keyboard on Facebook who came out of our day of rest hearing that the world erupted in flames, and I look at the beautiful brown skin of my daughter and her parents, and I’m angry and afraid. I’ve worked so hard to have these conversations with grace when you’re caught up in your feelings about the complexity. On a day when it’s not about the complexity, but processing and mourning actual death, can you please give the same grace to mine? Isaiah Rothstein is a multiracial rabbi who serves as the rabbi-in-residence at Hazon. Both sides of my ancestry hold a lot of pain of being othered and being oppressed. During these moments it’s sometimes hard to process and it’s a lot to integrate, but it’s a time where we’re expected to stand up and to speak up so I’m trying to find my voice every single day. On the one hand, I feel restless and frustrated and fed up. On the other hand, I think that like anyone who’s reading or seeing the headlines, I feel frustrated because so many people don’t care enough, or they care adjacently or from the outside. So there’s those emotions but then on the flip-side, I think that this moment is calling on all of us as Americans to stand up. If I could say in short what do I think the Jewish community should be doing, I would want every community to have an educational platform for communities to contextualize discussions around race, specifically as it relates to the Jewish community. I would want to have platforms, summits, days of learning. I would want every community to sign on to have educational campaigns around racial equity and racial awareness and racial sensitivity, so that we could find a bridge to understanding and perspectives through history, through knowledge of the past, so that we could better create a stronger, healthier bridge for the future. Anthony Mordechai Tzvi Russell is a musician who blends traditional Yiddish and African-American music. Let’s get real here, American Jews: You are living in an Old Country, whether you choose to recognize it or not. The state-sanctioned violence visited upon Black communities happens in ghettos you can easily pronounce, in towns you visit without the aid of a tour guide and cities you reside in without a granted law of return. So, who are you in this narrative, this country from which there is no real option of flight, this century which is your own, your heartless ruler, hands slick with the blood of children and refugees, the cavalries, maintaining “order” on your behalf over a people whose mere existence for centuries has been deemed disorderly? Solidarity with Black people doesn’t require a radical act of historical imagination. You are here. We are here. You know what to do. Do it. Now. Tema Smith is a writer and the director of professional development at 18Doors, an organization for interfaith families. I’m deeply upset about George Floyd and also that he is not the first and not the last, and that it’s taken a murder so egregious to really get people out into the streets in this way, and get a lot of people to wake up to what happens unfortunately too frequently. I also have deep gratitude for the moment that we’re in, for so many people who hadn’t previously spoken out are speaking out. As far as the Jewish community, the number of people who either have spoken out publicly or who have reached out privately as people who just care and want to make sure that me and other Jews of color are feeling OK right now — and I think most of my friends who are Jews of color are experiencing similar things from their friends — is huge. Frankly, I’ve gotten messages from people who I’ve never corresponded with beyond public tweets, just reaching out saying ‘Are you OK?’ and a recognition that is in many ways at a new level. This isn’t the first time that something like this has happened. This is the first time I’ve received messages from so many people and that makes me hopeful for that grassroots community level being there to support each other, and that is huge. And the fact that there is a growing chorus of voices in the Jewish community speaking up, that’s huge, and that people are showing up at protests, I can’t say enough of how meaningful it is to see that. Enzi Tanner is a social worker in Minneapolis and works with LGBT families experiencing homelessness. Yesterday we hosted a havdalah with JCA [Jewish Community Action] and JFREJ and I did a little talk and for me the thing that is really real for me is black Jews and Jews of color all across the country during this time have been incredibly supportive and amazing and just speaking for me, it has made this time so much more doable and bearable. I also say that because at this time, it’s also important that as the Jewish community reaches in and says how do we support their cause and how do we support the black community, it’s really important that people reach in to black Jews and other Jews of color and realize that we’re here. And we need our community. And the other thing is: believe us. When George Floyd said I can’t breathe, he was not believed. When black women tell doctors and nurses during childbirth that they’re in pain, they’re not believed which is why they die at a higher rate. We don’t want to have to give a dissertation when we say we’re experiencing racism in our communities. We want to be believed. And in this moment now, it’s really important that, in those situations, that we’re able to be believed. When we say our elected officials aren’t doing the best job they could be, we want that to be believed, we don’t want to be told that they’re doing the best they can because we’ve been here for far too long and our cities are literally burning and we just need folks to believe us and to support us. And to reach out to the Jews of color, the black Jews within the community as well as reaching out and being in it for the long haul. This isn’t about just one person, this is about all these different people and different things. And it’s hopefully not just about right now, it’s so that a different world will be possible. Evan Traylor is an educator, activist and soon-to-be rabbinical student at the Hebrew Union College — Jewish Institute of Religion. Right now, Black Jews are grieving. We’re grieving for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. But we’re grieving for so many more lives, Black lives, that have been taken from this earth far too early because of brutal, systemic racism. And that pain isn’t going away tomorrow, or next week, or next month. It’s going to last for generations to come. And, if we want a better world, we have to change the system. I’m grateful for so many white Jewish allies who have reached out, comforted me, supported me not just over the last week, but for years now. And right now, we need more from our white Jewish siblings, and more from our Jewish institutions — we need support, allyship, resources, and strategies to confront racism in our community, and in our world. We are all created in the image of God — it’s time to build the Jewish community and world that makes our Torah true in this age. Shira Hanau contributed reporting. Similar Posts:",0.0

It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke.Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. Biden also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.”Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid March.His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.”Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.”Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer.Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans' memorial near his Wilmington home, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd.In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke.“The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer.Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.”Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in.Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now.“I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”",0.0

The crowd of thousands rivaled the protests that took place in April 2015 after the arrest and death of Freddie Gray while in police custody. “It ain’t start with us, but it will end with us,” the banner at the head of tonight’s march read, as it began at the Baltimore Convention Center. It was the fourth day of protests in Baltimore, sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black Minneapolis man who died after a police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. Tonight’s crowd was sprawling and diverse but focused and on message. “Destroy White Supremacy,” one sign read. “Who do we call when the police murders?” asked another. “Justice for our slain.” A five-year-old girl, Nevaeh Aspden, held up a sign that said, “White allies: use your privilege to amplify black voices.” Held the day before the primary election, the march drew two mayoral candidates, who appear to have had very different experiences judging by social media. One showed City Council President Brandon Scott wearing a mask with the logo for the violence prevention group Ceasefire as he praises the young organizers of the march. The other showed former prosecutor Thiru Vignarajah being mocked and chased off by a group of people. Local Activists Speak Starting mid-afternoon at the Baltimore Convention Center, the action was kicked off by protest organizers and speakers that included activist Tawanda Jones, the brother of the late Tyrone West, who died in police custody, and Kelly Davis, who’s the wife of Keith Davis Jr., the man who was shot by police in 2015 and was later convicted of killing a Pimlico Race Course security guard. One 16-year-old told the crowd that she and four other teenagers organized the protest via text messages. “This is possible, and change is not impossible, don’t let anybody tell you differently,” she said from a back of a truck to the sea of protesters. From the convention center, the protesters marched along Baltimore Street through downtown, taking stops to present spoken word poetry by several black artists, before reaching City Hall. Making their way along Gay Street, the crowd began filing up on the ramp to I-83, walking along until they reached the Central Booking and Intake Center, where protesters chanted, “We love you,” to the prisoners inside. For a time, the expressway was completely shut down in both directions. Pessimism and Hope Compared to Saturday’s protest, the crowd was more heavily composed of young adults and teens, several telling The Brew that after seeing the video of George Floyd’s killing in police custody they felt compelled to join. “I got so emotional when I saw the videos yesterday morning. Something has to give,” said 26-year-old Amber Carson, who works at Royal Farms. “I feel like police are listening, they hear us, but nothing’s going to change. I don’t know, I’m not confident it will improve at all.” Shanell Kearney, 31, was also pessimistic. “It’s ridiculous, my six-year-old daughter was worried about her dad coming out to this protest, thinking he might get shot because he’s a black man,” Kearney said. “Nothing’s going to change, no matter how many times we do this,” she said. “We can burn every building, fight, scream, cry, nothing will change.” David Thomas, a 26-year-old from East Baltimore, was more hopeful. Sitting on a jersey barrier beneath I-83 as protesters walked by, he said he was outraged by the death of Floyd and other black people at the hands of police. But Thomas, who is black, said he has had no bad interactions with police and would actually like to become an officer in order to fight against racism and improve the culture in police departments nationwide. “If I had the opportunity to change something and I could be a cop, I would, because I could change things for the better,” said Thomas, a commercial truck driver. “Right now, they have peoples’ lives in their hands, and some of them just don’t care.”",0.0

Dover Mayor Robin Christiansen said during a Monday news conference that he had been advised to leave the curfew and corresponding state of emergency in place after Sunday's events, which initially saw demonstrators gather at the Dover Police Department headquarters and Legislative Hall before marching through the streets of the city over the course of the afternoon. But Christiansen said he was forced to take action after an ""influx of people"" who were not involved in the initial demonstration began to join the crowd and eventually a large group made its way up U.S. Route 13, proceeding to the Dover Mall, and then ending up at Delaware State Police headquarters and, after troopers dispersed them from their property, the Capital Inn across the street. ""I will protect you, your property, your homes, your family, and your churches from other people from the outside and have other plans for the City of Dover,"" he said. Delaware State Police and protesters on Sunday night. Following the news conference, which also involved members of state and Kent County clergy and equal rights organizations, Christiansen could be seen speaking with DeAndre Valentine, who organized Sunday afternoon's protests following the death last week of Floyd, who was black, after a white police officer kneeled on his neck. Valentine said looting and vandalism that occurred at multiple retail locations at the Dover Mall and along U.S. Route 13 was uncalled for and not the intention of his protest, which was focused on peacefully drawing attention to issues like racism and use of force by law enforcement. ""I understand where they came from but they need to understand that we won't get anywhere with that. Violence has never solved violence. It only creates more violence,"" he said. Dover Police Chief Tom Johnson said there wasn't an officer in city law enforcement that would have thought what happened in the video recording of officers' fatal arrest of Floyd was ""normal."" In regards to protests, Johnson said there will always be time for peaceful and responsible demonstrations but officers would have to take action not over how long a demonstration acts but because of behavior. ""We will not let physical destruction occur where we can prevent it. We will not let assaults occur where we can prevent it. We will not let the Dover brand suffer if we can prevent it,"" he said. Rev. Rita Mishoe Paige with New Beginnings AME Community Church, a member of Dover's interdenominational ministerial alliance, said during the press conference that recent demonstrations across the country have highlighted inequities for black communities. Paige said it's important that both protesters and leaders of communities across the country engage in meaningful dialogue over equality.

In recent years, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the face of the movement. In 2016, he began kneeling before games, during the playing of the national anthem, to protest police treatment of minorities and social inequality. Since last week's death of George Floyd, an African American man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck, there's been a surge of sports figures speaking out. Some have even joined demonstrations that have swept the nation. True to its status as the most politically progressive of this country's major sports, the NBA has had many players and officials lend their voices – from Commissioner Adam Silver to Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James to legendary Lakers center and longtime political activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who wrote about what he believes is the motivation behind the widespread protests. ""The black community is used to the institutional racism inherent in education, the justice system and jobs,"" Abdul-Jabbar said in a Los Angeles Times essay last weekend. ""And even though we do all the conventional things to raise public and political awareness ... the needle hardly budges."" He added, ""Yes, protests often are used as an excuse for some to take advantage, just as when fans celebrating a hometown sports team championship burn cars and destroy storefronts. I don't want to see stores looted or even buildings burn. But African Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you're choking on it — until you let the sun in."" Even Michael Jordan weighed in publicly, which to many was a surprise. The recent 10-part ESPN documentary, The Last Dance, lionized the legendary Chicago Bulls star, although it touched on a few perceived shortcomings, including what some see as Jordan's unwillingness to speak out on political issues. ""I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in,"" Jordan said in the documentary, adding, ""but I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player. ""I wasn't a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That's where my energy was."" But now Jordan is speaking out, an indication of how deeply Floyd's death has resonated. ""I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,"" Jordan said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough."" There have been other heartfelt, and perhaps surprising, shows of solidarity. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz also has been largely apolitical in his four years in the NFL. But last week, Wentz was one of the first prominent white athletes to speak out. ""Being from North Dakota, I've spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I'm never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through,"" Wentz said on Twitter. ""I'll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color. ... ""I don't understand the society we live in that doesn't value all human life. It's heartbreaking and disturbing. My prayers go out to every man, woman and child that has to endure the effects of the racism in our society."" Former and current African American teammates praised Wentz. ""You didn't have to say a thing but you did,"" former Eagles receiver Torrey Smith tweeted, adding, ""Love you bro."" Traditionally, Major League Baseball has, as a sport, avoided politics. Not now. A number of big leaguers have weighed in, including Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle. He's white, and he offered historical context in a tweet with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. ""Racism is America's Original Sin,"" Doolittle wrote. ""It was here before we even forged a nation, and has been passed down from generation to generation. And we still struggle to acknowledge that it even exists, much less atone for it. The generational trauma of racism and violence is killing black men and women before our eyes. ... ""We must not look away from the racism and violence. ... We must take action and call it out for what it is. We must recognize our shared humanity and atone for our Original Sin, or else we will continue to curse future generations with it. ""RIP George Floyd."" Still silence Even though the current environment seems to encourage sports figures to speak out, there's also notable silence coming from the sports world. So says LeVelle Moton. Moton is the men's basketball head coach at North Carolina Central University. He said white basketball and football coaches from the most prominent college conferences in the nation — the Power Five — are not speaking up. And he said he believes they should be. In fact, he said, they're obligated to do so. ""The reality is, a lot of these coaches have been able to create generational wealth,"" Moton told ESPN Radio. ""Their grandkids' kids are gonna be able to live a prosperous life because athletes who were the complexion of George Floyd were able to run a football, throw a football, shoot a basketball or whatever have you, so they have benefited greatly from athletes that look like George Floyd and many more. But whenever people the complexion of George Floyd are killed, assassinated, murdered in the street in broad daylight, they're silent."" Not all. Prominent white college basketball coaches have spoken out against Floyd's death, including the University of Kentucky's John Calipari, Roy Williams of the University of North Carolina and Michigan State University head coach Tom Izzo. Nick Saban is the most famous active head coach in Division 1 college football. He also released a statement about Floyd. ""We're at an important moment for our country,"" the University of Alabama coach said in a message that cited civil rights icons Rosa Parks and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., ""and now is the time for us to choose kindness, tolerance, understanding, empathy, and most importantly ... it's time to love each other. Every life is precious, and we must understand we have so many more things that unite us than divide us."" Still, the complexity of Kaepernick Sunday's Houston Chronicle sports section went beyond the myriad athlete and coach statements of grief and resolve. It took a strong stand with a full-page editorial statement. The page had a picture of Floyd at the top and a kneeling Kaepernick at the bottom. In between, a section read, ""Imagine, if we had embraced Colin Kaepernick's peaceful protest and paid attention to the issue he was trying to address."" It wasn't the only connector between Floyd and Kaepernick. A dramatic meme circulating since Floyd's death shows a picture of the Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, next to a picture of Kaepernick kneeling in protest. The visuals have stirred up the not-too-distant memory of Kaepernick's protest, which began in 2016, and was politicized from the beginning. And it's prompting harsh criticism of the NFL, even as the league joins the massive sports outpouring of grief and anger. Last weekend, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement offering condolences to Floyd's family as well as those of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, young African Americans also killed in recent high-profile cases. ""These tragedies inform the NFL's commitment and our ongoing efforts,"" Goodell said, adding, ""There remains an urgent need for action. We recognize the power of our platform in communities and as part of the fabric of American society. We embrace that responsibility and are committed to continuing the important work to address these systemic issues together with our players, clubs and partners."" Critics blasted Goodell for what they called hypocrisy. ""Colin Kaepernick asked the NFL to care about the lives of black people and they banned him from their platform,"" said Michael-Shawn Dugar, an NFL writer for The Athletic. Instead of prompting a discussion about police treatment of minorities and social inequality, Kaepernick's protests prompted a debate about patriotism and the flag, fueled by President Trump, who used an expletive to describe Kaepernick and other players who joined the pregame protests. Even though the NFL ultimately endorsed social justice initiatives, Kaepernick still is considered a pariah — no NFL owner has hired him. And with the league dealing with a significant lack of diversity in important head coaching and general manager positions, Goodell's critics said his reference to the league's ""commitment and our ongoing efforts"" is insincere. On their face, Goodell's words seemed in lockstep with much of the rest of the sports world as it grapples with and grieves over Floyd's death. But for many, the renewed attention on Kaepernick and his experience present just as powerful a message about the powerful NFL, where, in the volatile realm of race and justice, words appear louder than actions.

But several states have primaries up and down the ballot: Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Washington, D.C. Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to do. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary with its 186 delegates). Steve King on the ropes. Controversial conservative Rep. Steve King of Iowa faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who painted King as ineffective in the House, given he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. State Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face off against either State Sen.

Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Fomer Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces challenge from the left.

Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white, male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000.

But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List.

It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take Torres Small on this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It's been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans.

They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired U.S. Admiral Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach, who has spent the second most — $1.4 million — on this primary.

The retirements of moderate Democrat Pete Visclosky in Indiana's 1st District and Republican Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in Congress, in the 5th District has opened up both of these ideologically divergent seats. More than half a dozen Democrats have competed in the 1st District, which is suburban and exurban Chicago, a place that went for Hillary Clinton with 54% of the vote in 2016. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET Loading... In the 5th District, a handful of Republicans have duked it out, including state Sen. Victoria Spartz, who raised and spent the most and got the backing of the Club for Growth, and Beth Henderson, a local businesswoman with the endorsement of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun. Democrats have rallied around one candidate, Christina Hale. This district has been in GOP hands for a long time, but it could be one to watch this fall.

1623117076,2020-06-02 05:56:10,Violence continues as Trump threatens military force against protesters nationwide,https://www.localdvm.com/news/violence-continues-as-trump-threatens-military-force-against-protesters-nationwide/,en,True,,433540,localdvm.com,http://localdvm.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Hours after a carefully orchestrated declaration by President Donald Trump to send out the military and “dominate the streets,” American cities were engulfed in more violence and destruction that overshadowed peaceful protests demanding justice after generations of racism. In New York City, largely peaceful demonstrations were punctuated by people smashing storefront windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors to the storied Macy’s store on 34th Street, leaving the major Manhattan thoroughfare littered with broken glass. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring at least two. Just happened: a protest in a car run over a group of cops in Buffalo NY…Some of them might be dead  #BlackLivesMatter #protests2020 pic.twitter.com/UraxbRhMuV — Yousef NH (@YousefNH2) June 2, 2020 Demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in Manhattan’s chic Soho neighborhood, explained the destruction this way: “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ’Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this … again.’” The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day that Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the location where a white police officer put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing last week. The death toll from the unrest began to mount, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. The police chief in Louisville was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by security forces during unrest early Monday. Military helicopters flying dangerously low over crowds in Washington, DC pic.twitter.com/KmjMhRjCY1 — Michael Pegram (@MichaelNBC12) June 2, 2020 An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas, where police have made 338 arrests during three nights of violence that followed peaceful protests earlier in the day. Police had no immediate word on the officer’s condition. The latest wave of protests came on the day that Trump portrayed himself as hard-nosed, law-and-order president and police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump emerged after two days out of public view and threatened in remarks from the White House Rose Garden that he would deploy “thousands and thousands” of U.S. troops. Then he made a surprise walk through Lafayette Park to a Washington house of worship known as “The Church of the Presidents” that suffered fire damage in the protests. The photo op was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. The nation has been roiled by violence over the death of Floyd for nearly a week. The protests come after years of seeking police reforms over repeated cases of minorities dying in police custody, and at a time when the country is already reeling from the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw, whose officers have made hundreds of arrests. The president, seeking his second term in office, demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos at the historic house of worship. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. He's using the American military against the American people.  He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.  For a photo.  For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him. But I mean it when I say this: we can only do it together. https://t.co/G1yE67q9Nz — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) June 2, 2020 Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press.",0.0
1623117073,2020-06-02 06:27:32,Death toll grows in national protests,https://www.localdvm.com/news/national/death-toll-grows-in-national-protests/,en,False,,433540,localdvm.com,http://localdvm.com/,"One man was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who made sure to provide free meals to officers. Another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,” a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest. They are among the people who have been killed as protests roiled American cities in the week since 46-year-old George Floyd died when a white officer jammed his knee into the back of the black man’s neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of chaos engulfing cities across America, from heavy-handed riot police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black families to lose more members of their community amid the unrest. Dozens more have been hurt in various altercations — vehicles plowing into crowds, police officers suffering head injuries and broken bones and protesters ending up in emergency rooms with a variety of injuries from the melees. The death toll and circumstances surrounding the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know about the cases so far: LOUISVILLE As local police and the National Guard sought to disperse a crowd early Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing the owner of a barbecue restaurant, David McAtee. The mayor has since terminated the city’s police chief after finding out that officers on the scene did not activate their body cameras. The state police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. The 53-year-old McAtee was an African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by. “We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known Barbecue man.” The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd’s killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home. OAKLAND A federal law enforcement officer was providing security at the federal courthouse in Oakland during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically injured in the shooting. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers and employed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service; they were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional district north of Los Angeles. INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed over the weekend amid unrest in Indianapolis, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as “Mr. Indianapolis” and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after his graduation. He also was a prominent businessman in the city and ran multiple nightclubs. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.” The circumstances of his shooting weren’t immediately clear but some media reports said it happened near an apartment where he lived. It also occurred the same night that an 18-year-old man also was fatally shot as protests broke out in the city. MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, a 43-year-old black man was fatally shot outside a pawn shop as rioting broke out last week in Minneapolis and then spread nationally. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Calvin L. Horton Jr. Police say they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during unrest. OMAHA, NEBRASKA A 22-year-old black man was killed after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two bars in downtown Omaha. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including James Scurlock, approach bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people are seen on the video tackling Gardner, who ended up on his back and fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen tackling Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges, calling the shooting self-defense. DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot. CHICAGO Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania did not provide details about those who were killed but said it happened amid protests there.",0.0

He accused the president of creating an “incendiary moment” by threatening to do just that to quell violence that has arisen as demonstrators have taken to the streets in reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois,” Pritzker said on CNN after Trump urged governors to deploy the Guard. If they did not, he said he would send in “thousands and thousands” of soldiers. Pritzker was among the first governors to react to Trump’s comments, which came hours after the president called governors “weak” and urged them to take a more aggressive response to weekend violence. It came as Americans gathered to protest police brutality against black Americans following the killing of Floyd, who was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with people breaking into and stealing from businesses, smashing car windows and setting fires. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not deployed the state’s National Guard to New York City, although he said earlier Monday the state had 13,000 troops that “we can use at any moment.” “I say thank you but no thank you,” Cuomo said on CNN about Trump’s call to send military troops to the states. At least 23 states and the District of Columbia had already deployed guard troops as of Monday morning, according to a statement from the National Guard. It wasn’t clear whether the action would be enough to satisfy the president. Trump took no questions from reporters and did not say how he would decide whether a state’s response was sufficient. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has activated the state’s guard, said in a statement he prays “no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.” “This president has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office,” Inslee said in a statement. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat, said any suggestions the state’s National Guard is ill equipped to handle the states needs is “misinformed.” “As the Commander In Chief of the Nevada National Guard I can state, categorically, that they have done their duty to protect all Nevadans, and will continue to do so.” In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of demonstrators. She refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation, but on Monday activated 50 unarmed guard members in support roles. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” Brown, a Democrat, said earlier Monday in reaction to Trump’s comments about governors being weak in their response. “Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform.” She didn’t immediately comment on Trump’s remarks about deploying the U.S. military. Nor did California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has deployed thousands of guard troops to Los Angeles and other cities. He called Trump’s morning comments “noise” and avoided addressing them directly, although he said the nation is desperate for leadership. Guard members can assist law enforcement and perform duties such as traffic control, communications support and extinguishing fires.",0.0

1623157260,2020-06-02 05:57:00,Governors Push Back On Trump's Threat To Deploy Federal Troops To Quell Unrest,https://www.wypr.org/post/governors-push-back-trumps-threat-deploy-federal-troops-quell-unrest,en,False,,245165,wypr.org,http://wypr.org/,"Updated at 10:33 a.m. ET President Trump, in a conference call Monday with the nation's governors, threatened to deploy the U.S. military to restore order unless states hit by days of unrest ""put down"" violent demonstrations, urging leaders to ""dominate"" lawbreakers or risk looking like ""a bunch of jerks."" The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you; you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" ""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard."" ""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly."" Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal."" ""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way."" In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

1623157259,2020-06-02 06:08:00,What We're Reading About The Past Week Of Protests,https://www.wypr.org/post/what-were-reading-about-past-week-protests,en,False,,245165,wypr.org,http://wypr.org/,"If you've been trying to keep up with news about the nationwide protests against police brutality, the stream of stories can be overwhelming. In the days following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody, reporters have been covering the protests in more than 140 cities across the country, trying to make sense of this tumultuous moment. Here are some of the most illuminating stories that we've read this week to help us understand how we got here, and the larger issues driving the protests. Minneapolis in context This is hardly the first time that Minneapolis has erupted into protests about police brutality and the killings of black people. In 2016, people took to the streets after police shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in a nearby suburb, Falcon Heights. And in 2015, Minneapolis police shot and killed Jamar Clark, which ignited two weeks of protests. In the Boston Review, Elizabeth Hinton relates the current protests in Minneapolis to the ones that followed the deaths of Clark and Castile. She also looks at the nationwide unrest that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Similar to the uprisings that took place more than half a century ago, she writes, Minneapolis residents are fed up with the ""buildup of unanswered grievances and the lack of concrete changes to their immediate living conditions."" ""Rather than responding to violent political rebellion with policy—such as addressing mass unemployment, failing public schools, and inhumane housing conditions—policymakers and officials, from Richard Nixon's War on Crime to the bipartisan War on Drugs to Donald Trump's embrace of 'Law and Order' politics, have consistently sought to manage the material consequences of socioeconomic problems (e.g., urban decay and drug abuse) with more police, more surveillance, and, eventually, more incarceration. We as a nation still fail to reckon with the wisdom King prophetically offered toward the end of his life: that only 'social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention. There is no other answer. Constructive social change will bring certain tranquility; evasions will merely encourage turmoil.' "" Policing Over at Slate, Joel Anderson writes that while many police chiefs are condemning the excessive use of force by the police officer who killed Floyd, it's important to pay attention to what police are doing during protests: ""The initial response of police leaders may have felt like progress, but video footage of police and protesters clashing in the streets reveals the truth: Officers are much closer to what we see in viral videos documenting their brutality than in the well-intentioned words of their leaders. Despite the shift in public statements, police haven't changed since the protests of 2014 and 2015."" Many protesters, including journalists, have captured police on tape pointing guns, shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at them. Matthew Dessem compiled a list at Slate of the ways police incited violence: ""Police all over the country tear-gassed protesters, drove vehicles through crowds, opened fire with nonlethal rounds on journalists or people on their own property, and in at least one instance, pushed over an elderly man who was walking away with a cane."" Existing while black The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging during the protests, and as we've reported, black people are dying from the virus at disproportionate rates. And as Annalisa Merelli at Quartz writes, police brutality is also a public health crisis that affects black people at a much higher rate than others: ""To give a sense of the magnitude of the crisis, the APHA reported that in 2016 alone (the latest year for which the organization could get reliable data, in itself a telling sign of the lack of priority accorded to the issue) at least 1,019 people were killed due to police intervention, and 76,440 were injured. This resulted in nearly 55,000 years of life lost, and had a large price tag, too: Police brutality costs $1.8 billion per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control's most recently available data (2010)."" Many argue that these two crises for the black community — police brutality and the coronavirus — aren't independent of each other. In fact, in both cases, the extent of the death toll stems from systemic discrimination, and in both cases, the solution may require a deep rethinking of the overall system. In The Atlantic, Ibram X. Kendi examines an 1896 document by a statistician that says black people were naturally selected for disease and death, and would gradually become extinct. Kendi goes on to write that ""too many Americans have been waiting for black extinction since Hoffman,"" and that black Americans are ""living in a nightmare"" rather than the elusive American dream: ""A nightmare is essentially a horror story of danger, but it is not wholly a horror story. Black people experience joy, love, peace, safety. But as in any horror story, those unforgettable moments of toil, terror, and trauma have made danger essential to the black experience in racist America. What one black American experiences, many black Americans experience. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the toil and terror and trauma of other black Americans. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the souls of the dead. Because they know: They could have been them; they are them. Because they know it is dangerous to be black in America, because racist Americans see blacks as dangerous."" Stories of solidarity Our NPR colleague Leila Fadel wrote about a Somali immigrant, Safia Munye, who opened a restaurant in Minneapolis more than two years ago — only to close her doors because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the community rallied behind her business and raised more than $180,000 to reopen this weekend — that is, until it was burned down during the protests. But despite her loss, Munye says she wants justice for Floyd and change for Minneapolis. "" 'My heart is broken. My mind is broken,' she says. 'I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice.' "" And The New York Times brought us another story about resilience and solidarity, about a Bangladeshi family in Minneapolis who also lost their restaurant after it was burned down during one of the protests. Yet they support the uprising, and even opened the restaurant's doors as a medical haven for protesters. "" 'We were just trying to do what we could to help our community,' said [Hafsa] Islam, who helped treat wounded protesters. 'Sure, we had our business. Sure, we were trying to keep our kitchen open. But more than anything, we were concerned for our people.' ""The tension in [Ruhel] Islam's adopted city reminds him of his childhood in Bangladesh, when he lived through a dictatorship. Two of his fellow students were killed by the police, he said. 'We grew up in a traumatic police state, so I am familiar with this type of situation,' he said.""

Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful. But looting and vandalism in some areas along Van Nuys Boulevard prompted a response from officers, who fired bean bags. Authorities also responded to a fire at a strip mall, according to the Los Angeles Times. San Francisco Bay Area Some 15,000 people marched peacefully in downtown Oakland, according to a police spokesperson quoted in the East Bay Times. Most dispersed prior to the start of the city's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. More than 40 people were arrested for violating the curfew, according to the Oakland Police Department. The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said. Police said some protesters had vandalized a handful of vehicles, according to NPR member station KQED. More than a dozen San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions have imposed curfews in the wake of protests sparked by Floyd's death.

David McAtee was shot and killed by law enforcement as they broke up a crowd early Monday morning in Louisville, officials said.Steve Conrad, who was Louisville Metro Police Department's chief at the time, went to the scene shortly after it happened to give details. He said the incident happened around 12:15 a.m. in the parking lot of Dino's Food Mart, located at 26th and Broadway.McAtee owned a restaurant nearby called Yaya's BBQ.Mayor Greg Fischer called McAtee a wonderful citizen, and said many knew him as ""the BBQ man.""Conrad said LMPD and the National Guard were breaking up a large group at that location when someone fired at them. Law enforcement then returned fire, police said. Police said they have several persons of interest being interviewed and it is still unclear who fired the first shot and who struck McAtee.“It’s very clear that many people do not trust the police. That is an issue we’re going to work on and work through,"" Conrad said during an early morning news conference.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear held a news conference around noon saying to his understanding, there was significant footage of what happened, including from body cameras. He called on all of it to be released quickly.“I’m not asking people to trust our account (of what happened). I want to see the video for ourselves,” Beshear said.It was later learned that none of the LMPD officers present had their cameras activated. Two LMPD officers on the scene who police confirm were involved, Kate Crews and Allen Austin, have been put on administrative leave.The governor said he has heard the crowd at that food mart was not demonstrating at the time, but police responded because they were violating curfew.A curfew went into effect Sunday night at 9 p.m. for the whole city. That curfew has since been extended through June 8.It was an attempt by the mayor to settle unrest that has gone on for several days in the city over the Breonna Taylor case and other cases causing protests and riots across the country.Beshear also had Taylor's mother speak Monday, during which she said, ""We can't get justice with violence.""Seven people were shot the first day of protests in Louisville.

And, we found a national underground network to cause chaos. Multiple law enforcement sources tell the I-TEAM they’ve gathered more evidence showing the vandalism and looting downtown Saturday didn’t just happen to break out. They believe organized troublemakers helped set it off. FOX 8 I TEAM: Cuyahoga co sheriff now says the number of arrests from weekend rioting/looting/curfew violations is up to 99…as of yestersay the official number was 66….unclear at this point what accounts for the rise in total numbers — Ed Gallek (@edgallekfox8) June 1, 2020 Investigators say they could tell by what some people in the crowd wore or by what they said to each other in the streets or by how they started the chaos. It all began with a protest over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minnesota, but that protest exploded. Eric Feinberg is not surprised outsiders disrupted that protest. Feinberg researches the fringes of the internet for a group called the “Coalition for a Safer Web.” He showed the I-TEAM an underground network to track protests and police. He said clearly the people who came here to riot have no interest in justice for George Floyd. “No, they’re here to cause havoc,” he said. He spoke about the information getting shared on back channels. “You can see what’s going on in Atlanta, Chicago, New York, and say, ‘Hey, I want a piece of it.’ Started out as a national page of protests or riots. They’re now separating them out.” “And, they’re patching into police scanners. So, basically, giving tactical information to the protesters or rioters to either avoid or engage with law enforcement.” The I-TEAM has learned the protest here turned into rioting and looting when people carrying backpacks showed up. Investigators even heard some giving instructions to others” ‘Do this” or “Don’t do that.” *Read more on the protests, here.* And listen to what the Cuyahoga County Sheriff says happened right outside the Justice Center. “They started throwing, like, heads of lettuce and broccoli. Then, the bottles started coming. Water bottles, glass bottles,” said Sheriff David Schilling. The sheriff says investigators are now trying to identify the instigators. “We believe these are individuals that travel throughout the country to these types of events where they’re intent on causing trouble,” he explained. Now, it will take a very long time to recover from the trouble in downtown Cleveland Monday afternoon, the sheriff said the number of arrests tied to the disturbance had risen to 99. The I-TEAM checked dozens of addresses of people arrested, and we found them all from NE Ohio. Sources tell us by the time police started making arrests on Saturday evening, the instigators had disappeared. *See our latest investigative stories, here.*",0.0
1623319784,2020-06-02 10:06:00,Protesters Invoke Different Names to Decry Police Treatment,http://www.wboc.com/story/42200599/protesters-invoke-different-names-to-decry-police-treatment,en,True,,1585,WBOC-TV,http://www.wboc.com,"CHICAGO (AP)- In Baltimore, protesters shouted the name of Freddie Gray. In Topeka, Kansas, T-shirts were emblazoned with the name of Dominique White. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, people gathered in a spot where white mobs killed hundreds of blacks a century ago and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher.  Across the U.S. as protesters poured into the streets to voice anger about last week's death of George Floyd, they also marked the occasion with reminders that the handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as on officer pinned him to the pavement with his knee on his neck is simply the latest addition to a grim roster.  Their stories have substantial differences, but protesters used their names and faces on posters to drive home the point that Floyd is part of a larger story about the dangers of being black in the United States.  ""George Floyd is causing people in their own communities to recall, reflect and then get angry all over again about their own police killings,“ said Marshall Hatch, a Chicago minister who eulogized Bettie Jones, who was struck by a bullet from an officer responding to a domestic dispute at a neighbor's house that also left 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier dead in 2015.  Hatch said Floyd’s death has served as a reminder to continue to push for justice in deaths throughout the country. He said that on Wednesday, he and other religious leaders plan to gather outside police headquarters to demand the officer who was fired after fatally shooting Jones and LeGrier also face criminal charges.  “There is a lot of feelings of incomplete justice all over the country,” he said.  Allisa Findley, whose brother, Botham Jean, was killed in 2018 inside his apartment by a white Dallas police officer who said she mistook his apartment for her own told WFAA television in Dallas, ""It is like pouring salt into an open wound every time there is another case.”  “Yes, it’s a different name, but it’s the same situation,” Findley said  In New York, many protesters shouted, “I can’t breathe,” a reminder that the words Floyd said in his last moments of life echoed what Eric Garner, stopped by police in New York City’s Staten Island for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes, said when a police officer put him in what appeared to be a chokehold in 2014.  One of the first things Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said publicly about Floyd's death was that it brought back to her the pain that the city felt in 2015 when a video of a white police officer shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald was released.  In Oakland, California, protesters gathered at Oscar Grant Plaza, named for the 22-year-old who was pulled by police from a Bay Area Rapid Transit train early on New Year's Day 2009 and killed in one of the first police shootings captured on video by bystanders.  Grant's mother, Wanda Johnson, could not help but think of her son when she saw a bystander's video of Floyd's final moments.  “It brought back so many memories of them trying to demonize him, then trying to have other officers there and none trying to control the situation,” Johnson told KRON-TV in the Bay Area.  In Baltimore, it was impossible not to think of what happened in 2015 - from the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray after he suffered major spinal injuries while being transported in a police van to the unrest that followed.  “It was a stark reminder of our own city’s trauma,” Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young told the Baltimore Sun.  While Gray's name has remained part of the national conversation about police treatment of blacks, what has been striking is that demonstrations in every corner of the country tell their own piece of a larger story.  Terence Crutcher was fatally shot in 2016 by a white police officer, Betty Shelby, who was later acquitted of manslaughter.  “If you all could just scream at the top of your lungs and let Terence know that you still care, that you haven’t forgotten,” his twin sister, Tiffany Crutcher, told a Tulsa crowd.  Michael Ramos, described by friends and family as black and Hispanic, was fatally shot by Austin, Texas, police in April as the 42-year-old drove away from officers after first being shot with a beanbag. The shooting remains under investigation, and Ramos' mom, Brenda Ramos, questioned why the officer who shot him hasn't been arrested or at least suspended.  “Now I am in this terrible heartbreaking club,"" Ramos' mom, Brenda Ramos, told reporters over the weekend. ""It's a club of mothers of black Americans who have been murdered by police.”  In Topeka, protests included the shouts of, “Say his name! Dominique White.” The 30-year-old Topeka man was armed when officers, responding to a report of gunfire, confronted him and fatally shot him in 2017. While an internal police investigation found the officers followed department policies, protesters still have questions, as do relatives who have filed a lawsuit.  In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo posted a slide with the names of many black men killed or abused by police in cities around the nation.  “You are blind, or in denial, if you are still treating each one like a unique situation,” he said at his Saturday morning press briefing. “How many times have we seen the same situation?  ""Yes, the names change. But the color doesn’t.” ",0.0

Smith is training in Austin as he attends the University of Texas.

The Olympics and protests The Olympic Games themselves are no stranger to protests. One of the most famous examples was in the 1968 Olympics when black athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos each raised a fist on the podium after medaling in the 200 meter race while the Star Spangled Banner was being played. According to History.com, their raised black-gloved fists represented their “solidarity and support with black people and oppressed people around the world.” They also stood in “black-socked feet without shoes to bring attention to black poverty, [and wore] beads to protest lynchings.” The third man on the podium was Australian Peter Norman, who didn’t raise his fist but joined them in wearing a badge for the Olympic Project for Human rights All faced intense backlash. The Americans were suspended from the U.S. team and the Australian never competed in the Olympics again despite qualifying multiple times for the Australian Olympic team, History.com said. Dr. John Carlos said you see far more athletes stepping up now in the name of social justice and recently told WDVM’s Marcus Dash, “I sit back and smile with pride and say, ‘They are the fruit of my labor.'” Dr. John Carlos travels the U.S. talking many different kinds of groups.

Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George floors last words, but they didn't die with him. You're still being heard going all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin put your life at risk. They speak to the nation were more than 100,000 people have lost their lives a virus and 40 million have filed for unemployment. With the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated black and brown communities, they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. It's a wake up call to our nation. In my view, it's for all of us, and I mean all of us. It's not the first time we've heard those words. They're the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it's time to listen to those words, to try to understand, to respond to him respond with action. A country is crying out for leadership leadership that can you. Nine US leadership That brings us together. Leadership that could recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on the neck for a long time. There's no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches. There's during businesses. Many have been built by the very people of color who are first time in their lives, are beginning to realize their dreams and bill wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for police sworn to protect and serve all people escalate tension, resort to excessive violence, way need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunistic, violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president, to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. Would peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president, a president from the doorstep of the People's House, the White House, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op? A photo of one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, D. C. We can be forgiven for believing the president's more interesting in power, then in principle were just serving the passions of his based on the needs of the people in his care, for that's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at ST John's Church. I just wish he opened it once in a while, said a brandishing. If he opened it, he could have learned something. They're all called love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump is interested in doing that work. Instead, he's preening and sweeping away all the guard rails. Lo have protected our democracy guard rails. I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one. So for an economic hardship, wondering, can I feed my family tomorrow? What's gonna have suffering under the weight of a generation after generation after generation, I've heard inflicted on people of color black brown in native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means. Degree. My losses are not the same as loss is felt by so many. But I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also knew, but the best way to bear loss and pain to turn it into that anger and anguish in the purpose. And Americans know what our purposes is a nation. It has to be guided. Mr. Guided guided us from the very beginning. No, it's been reported the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her daddy's arms, said, Oh, Daddy, she said, Now we're never going to get our freedom. Daddy was reassuring, Strong, brave. He said, No, don't worry, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Amid the violence and fear, Dr King persevered. He was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then 19 68. Hate cut him down in Memphis two days before Dr Key was murdered. Hey gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington. No, he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long said, it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have. We have to believe that still, that's our purpose. It's been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only creating, but they're treated equally, not just credited, would treated equally to become a nation to find, in Dr King's words, not only by the absence of tension before the presence of justice, I'm not just a not attention but justice. Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of F. D. R. And Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Jonah Salt. Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty and courage, and above all, we should be in America that chairs each other each and every one of us. You know, we're a nation in pain. We must let let our pain destroys. We're nation and raged. We can not our rage consume us. We're a nation. It's exhausted. But we will not allow our exhaustion to fetus as presidents. My commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome. We stand together. Finally, is one America. We'll rise stronger than we were before. We'll move that art closer to justice. We'll reach out to one another for speak out for one another. And please, please do what's recently been happening. Take care of one another. This is the United States of America. There's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it. We've done it together together, united. That's we are at our best. God bless you all. May God protect our troops que Mr Mayor. Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe.

I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one. So for an economic hardship, wondering, can I feed my family tomorrow? What's gonna have suffering under the weight of a generation after generation after generation, I've heard inflicted on people of color black brown in native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means. Degree. My losses are not the same as loss is felt by so many. But I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also knew, but the best way to bear loss and pain to turn it into that anger and anguish in the purpose. And Americans know what our purposes is a nation. It has to be guided. Mr. Guided guided us from the very beginning. No, it's been reported the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her daddy's arms, said, Oh, Daddy, she said, Now we're never going to get our freedom. Daddy was reassuring, Strong, brave. He said, No, don't worry, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Amid the violence and fear, Dr King persevered. He was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then 19 68. Hate cut him down in Memphis two days before Dr Key was murdered. Hey gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington. No, he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long said, it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have. We have to believe that still, that's our purpose. It's been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only creating, but they're treated equally, not just credited, would treated equally to become a nation to find, in Dr King's words, not only by the absence of tension before the presence of justice, I'm not just a not attention but justice. Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of F. D. R. And Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Jonah Salt. Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty and courage, and above all, we should be in America that chairs each other each and every one of us. You know, we're a nation in pain. We must let let our pain destroys. We're nation and raged. We can not our rage consume us. We're a nation. It's exhausted. But we will not allow our exhaustion to fetus as presidents. My commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome. We stand together. Finally, is one America. We'll rise stronger than we were before. We'll move that art closer to justice. We'll reach out to one another for speak out for one another. And please, please do what's recently been happening. Take care of one another. This is the United States of America. There's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it. We've done it together together, united. That's we are at our best. God bless you all. May God protect our troops que SIGN UP FOR BREAKING NEWS Get local stories sent straight to your inbox as news breaks. Submit Privacy Notice",0.0

The bishop who oversees St. John's is among the critics. ""He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR's Morning Edition. ""He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation."" ""He did not pray,"" the bishop continued. ""He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate ... represent."" Every president since James Madison has visited St. John's Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday's visit. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" Budde told NPR's Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. ""I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,"" the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John's a few minutes after Washington's just-installed 7 p.m. curfew began. The federal force used against the demonstrators nearly 30 minutes before the curfew began incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""Shameful!"" Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after ""federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,"" the city's police force's job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult. I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!  DC residents — Go home. Be safe — Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020 When the federal force rushed at protesters outside the White House, journalists were also pushed out. Officers attacked Australian reporter Amelia Brace and also hit cameraman Tim Myers, prompting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call for an investigation. The scene played out on live TV, during Australia's breakfast-time Sunrise show. ""While live on air, Myers was struck in the chest by a riot shield and Brace was clubbed with a police baton,"" Australia's 7NEWS reports.

""Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,"" she says. ""We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to ... and then we ended up getting tear-gassed."" The situation, she said, was ""absolutely terrifying."" ""I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we'll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we're feeling perfectly safe,"" Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, ""Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously."" Trump's use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation's capital. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" ""All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,"" Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement. While Budde is thankful to first responders who put out that fire, she says she wants the focus to remain on the death of George Floyd and others who have died at the hands of police. ""I want to acknowledge the loss of property, but in no way equate it with the loss of life,"" she said. ""I want to be a church that stands in solidarity with those who are making peaceful protest."" : 6/01/20 An earlier version of this Web story mistakenly said that President Trump walked to St. John's Church nearly 30 minutes before Washington's 7 p.m. curfew began.

1623386148,2020-06-02 10:40:00,"Russian-American Masha Gessen Sees Putin In Trump, Trouble In Future",https://www.wypr.org/post/russian-american-masha-gessen-sees-putin-trump-trouble-future,en,False,,245165,wypr.org,http://wypr.org/,"Americans are suddenly consumed with multiple crises. Even before the outbreak of social unrest following yet another African American's death in police custody, the ravages of COVID-19 and economic free fall had disrupted the national life. All of which means conditions are ripe for President Trump to assume more power and move closer to the status of autocratic ruler, says New Yorker writer Masha Gessen in a new book Surviving Autocracy. Gessen's viewpoint may be head-spinning for many, especially those who believe today's maelstrom of disease, unemployment and racial violence represent failures by the incumbent president. Yet Gessen argues that Trump may see it all as an opportunity, not just in his pursuit of re-election, but in what Gessen believes is his longer-term concept of his own career trajectory. ""He may inadvertently have created perfect conditions for autocratic consolidation,"" Gessen writes, a climate of ""more anxiety and fear of change."" Gessen quotes the 20th-century scholar Hannah Arendt, author of The Origins of Totalitarianism, who observed how future dictators used instability ""while at the same time dangling the promise of stability."" In uncertain times, the aspiring autocrat promises a restoration, a return to greatness — all the while reaching for more power and permanence. Gessen suggests Trump will seek to use all that has happened in his tumultuous term to achieve a breakthrough to unlimited power on the model of Russian President Vladimir Putin. For many readers, comparing an elected American president to a Russian dictator is simply beyond the pale. But if the comparison seemed strained a week ago, it seems less so on the morning after Trump dressed down the governors of the affected states and brandished the threat of federal troops taking over their streets. Gessen clearly regards Trump not only as a Putin apologist and sometime collaborator but as a Putin impersonator. The author argues that Trump models himself on Putin, not because he expects to replicate Russian political culture here but because he wants America to see him the way Russia sees Putin — as someone who can return his country to the glories of ""an imaginary past."" Gessen says Putin and Trump were elected president without really wanting the job. They ran ""not for president but for autocrat,"" and they did not expect to settle for anything less. Putin has been in office 16 years, is on track for four more and is maneuvering to secure another eight thereafter. Trump has retweeted pictures of prospective campaign signs that say TRUMP 2024 and TRUMP 2028 and so on into the future. Born in Moscow in 1967, Gessen has won acclaim largely for writing on this native land, including winning a National Book Award for a 2017 examination of Putin's rise and suppression of democracy. And while the Putin-Trump link has been made elsewhere, it is forged here in Gessen's own personal history. Brought to New York by immigrating parents in the early 1980s, Gessen returned to this birthplace on journalistic assignment a decade later. Gessen then spent most of the next 20 years as a writer, editor and activist in post-Soviet Russia, observing the rise of the former KGB officer who now holds that nation's highest office. Gessen wrote books on a wide array of subjects, including a grandmother's struggles to survive the Nazis and the Soviet regime of Joseph Stalin. Another is about the female punk band Pussy Riot, sentenced to prison for its protest songs. Gessen cites an array of scholars in this, the writer's 11th book. One is Hungarian sociologist Bálint Magyar, who has described the present condition of his own country as a ""mafia state,"" ruled by a crime family in which ""one man distributes money and power to all other members."" (Viewers of The Sopranos will understand how this model works.) Magyar also identifies three stages by which a ruler is transformed into an autocrat: the attempt, the breakthrough and the consolidation. Gessen sees Trump's term so far as the autocratic attempt, his re-election as a prospective breakthrough and a second term as the green light to consolidate his power. ""The first three years [of Trump's term] have shown that an autocratic attempt in the U.S. has credible chance of succeeding,"" Gessen writes. ""Worse than that, they have shown that an autocratic attempt builds logically on the structures and norms of American government; on the concentration of power in the executive branch, and on the marriage of money and politics."" Gessen says the institutions and traditions Americans thought would protect them have proven ""weak"" because they were not built to withstand a personality such as Trump. The author had little faith that Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election would be ""the magic bullet"" that would rid Washington of Trump. Instead, Gessen writes, it drew attention away from what Trump was doing ""in plain view ... ignoring and destroying all institutions of accountability ... degrading political speech ... using his office to enrich himself ... courting dictator after dictator ... promoting xenophobic conspiracy theories."" Since 2013, Gessen has been back in the U.S., writing and also teaching at Amherst College. Although Gessen's been widely published, the writer's main main outlets have been in the Big Apple — The New York Times, The New York Review of Books and The New Yorker, where Gessen has been a staff writer since 2017. Regular readers of that magazine will recognize some of Surviving Autocracy from columns in The New Yorker. Gessen brings to all work a unique blend of intellect and manifold passions — for math and science, for language and politics, and for the cause of LGBTQ people in both homelands. (Gessen also identifies as nonbinary.) The writer flashes the fierce attitude and language of the partisan activist one moment, returning to the cooler mien of a public intellectual the next. Gessen is particularly sensitive to issues of linguistics and the subtle shifts of wording that can mean so much — noting how the words ""immigrant"" and ""refugee"" (both relatively sympathetic terms for most Americans) have been systematically replaced by such terms as ""migrant"" or ""invasion."" Gessen is also exercised about the change Trump has wrought in the perception of reality. In a chapter titled ""The Power Lie,"" Gessen explains the difference between an ordinary lie that may ""collapse in the face of facts"" and ""the Trumpian lie."" The latter is ""the power lie, or the bully lie ... the lie of the bigger kid who took your hat and is wearing it — while denying that he took it. There is no defense against this lie because the point of the lie is to assert power, to show 'I can say what I want when I want to.' "" The media generally assist in this, Gessen argues, even when serious news organizations ""fact-check"" the president, by presenting two notions of reality side by side and inviting the audience to decide. Right there, the president has won, Gessen says. The lie has been given equal standing with verifiable facts, and the concept of truth has been devalued. Gessen objects repeatedly to the reluctance of legacy newspapers and broadcasters (including NPR) to call the president a liar (or for that matter, a racist). Even when pointing out the inaccuracies and falsehoods the president peddles, traditional journalists balk at terms such as lie and liar. In part, the idea is to keep the door as wide open as possible to attract and retain as wide an audience as possible. Gessen understands this reasoning but says it allows the liar or the racist to persist and normalizes such behavior until it appears less objectionable — or simply not objectionable at all. But getting back to the word ""surviving"" and its implicit promise in the title, Gessen gives us this: ""Recovery from Trumpism — a process that will be necessary whenever Trumpism ends — will not be a process of returning to government as it used to be, a fictional state of pre-Trump normalcy. Recovery will be possible only as reinvention: of institutions, of what politics means to us, and of what it means to be a democracy, if that is indeed what we choose to be."" At this point, of course, one must wonder who Gessen means by ""we."" One impression easily taken from Surviving Autocracy is that Trump has been visited on Americans by some mysterious force or personal magic. There is a lack of focus on the manner by which Trump, as opposed to Putin, came to office. Gessen's perceptions about Russia's people and politics are surely more valuable than those of Americans who have never been there (or only visited briefly). But by the same token, average Americans might well ask how much Gessen really knows about the interior states or the interior life of most Americans. In a 2018 interview with The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, Gessen volunteered an empathetic reference to those Trump has called ""the forgotten man and the forgotten woman,"" the middle-aged and older members of the middle class who felt less at home in their own country in recent decades. What if Gessen had spent more time in the country these people feel they have lost? It would not likely change Gessen's mind about Trump. But it might alter the writer's perspective on Trumpism. It might help translate a deep empathy for the plight of ordinary Russians and relate it to the fears and frustrations of their American counterparts — the millions who voted for Trump and now accept his authoritarian tendencies as being in their own interest.

Some shared their Christian faith, asking for others of faith to support and advocate for change. “We recognize that Jesus’ death was both a sacrifice and a murder, and when you identify it as a murder we have a responsibility to be out here demanding justice for acts of cruelty and acts of violence.” said Russell Pointer Jr. a pastor. Activist and Reverend, Justin Jones said the turmoil won’t end until racist institutions are dismantled and new legislation protects against unjust policing. At one point during the event people walked in groups of two up to the state capitol. Some state representatives held up the barrier tape allowing protesters to pass through. Once at the top of the capitol, protestors asked the Tennessee National Guard to drop their shields and they did. The crowd exploded in cheers and someone said through a megaphone, “We want to thank our National Guard for being on the right side of history.” Jones called their actions, a divine occurrence, “it was a movement of faith for them to put down their swords and shields, because we came up here singing and we came up here prayerful. We are here to bring peace and change.”",0.0

You have. Advertisement Over 60 people arrested, 10 officers hurt during Rhode Island violence Share Shares Copy Link Copy A crowd of hundreds of people that the head of the Rhode Island State Police described as a “mob"" smashed storefront windows, broke into a closed mall and torched a police cruiser in Providence early on Tuesday morning.More than 60 people were arrested and as many as 10 police officers were injured when they were hit by rocks or bricks, authorities said.The people who caused the damage were not protesting the death of George Floyd, the Minneapolis man who died after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air, authorities said.“This was a mob,” state police Col. James Manni said. “These were not protesters. This was an intentional, coordinated attack on the city.""Police received intelligence several hours prior to the violence that people were coming from out of state armed with crow bars, flares and gasoline, Manni said.Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza on Tuesday morning said five of the people arrested were from out of state.Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven M. Paré said Tuesday that none of the hurt officers was seriously injured.The trouble started at around midnight when a crowd of 300 to 500 people gathered in the street outside the Providence Place mall, police said. At about 2 a.m. police deployed tear gas to disperse the crowd, but fireworks and sirens continued to be heard in the city for hours, according to media reports.At one point several people broke into the mall, and Manni thinks they intended to set it on fire.Manni and Elorza say the damage could have been much worse had the police not been prepared.“Last night’s incidents were devastating for our community who has already experienced so much unrest and pain,"" Elorza said in a statement. “Violence is never the answer and we need collective action - one that is productive, not destruction of our small businesses, who have been impacted so much already and by putting others safety at risk.""The mall, which reopened for the first time Monday since being closed in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic, was closed Tuesday, according to its website.",0.0

THERE’S NOTHING Advertisement Death toll grows in national protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Amid protests seeking justice for a black man killed after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck, several people have lost their lives. They include a well-known and popular owner of a barbecue spot in Louisville, Kentucky and a federal officer working security at a courthouse in Oakland. Many of these deaths have gone unnoticed, overshadowed by the turmoil roiling American cities.One man was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who made sure to provide free meals to officers. Another was a man known as ""Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest.They are among the people who have been killed as protests roiled American cities in the week since 46-year-old George Floyd died when a white officer jammed his knee into the back of the black man's neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of chaos engulfing cities across America, from heavy-handed riot police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism.Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black families to lose more members of their community amid the unrest.Dozens more have been hurt in various altercations — vehicles plowing into crowds, police officers suffering head injuries and broken bones and protesters ending up in emergency rooms with a variety of injuries from the melees.The death toll and circumstances surrounding the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know about the cases so far:LOUISVILLEAs local police and the National Guard sought to disperse a crowd early Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing the owner of a barbecue restaurant, David McAtee. The mayor has since terminated the city's police chief after finding out that officers on the scene did not activate their body cameras. The state police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating.The 53-year-old McAtee was an African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by.""We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. ""David was a friend to many, a well-known Barbecue man.""The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd's killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home.___OAKLANDA federal law enforcement officer was providing security at the federal courthouse in Oakland during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle.Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically injured in the shooting. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building's glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti.Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers and employed by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service; they were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional district north of Los Angeles. ___INDIANAPOLISTwo people were killed over the weekend amid unrest in Indianapolis, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University.Beaty was known as ""Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after his graduation. He also was a prominent businessman in the city and ran multiple nightclubs.""I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,"" coach Tom Allen said in a statement. ""Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.""The circumstances of his shooting weren't immediately clear but some media reports said it happened near an apartment where he lived. It also occurred the same night that an 18-year-old man also was fatally shot as protests broke out in the city.___MINNEAPOLISIn what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, a 43-year-old black man was fatally shot outside a pawn shop as rioting broke out last week in Minneapolis and then spread nationally.The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Calvin L. Horton Jr. Police say they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood.The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during unrest. ___OMAHA, NEBRASKAA 22-year-old black man was killed after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two bars in downtown Omaha. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including James Scurlock, approach bar owner Jake Gardner.Two people are seen on the video tackling Gardner, who ended up on his back and fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen tackling Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock.Authorities have declined to press charges, calling the shooting self-defense.___DETROITA 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver's seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot.___CHICAGO SUBURBTwo people were killed during unrest Monday in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania did not provide details about those who were killed but said it happened amid protests there.",0.0

You say you're against police brutality; will you do something humble and kneel with us?' and I said, 'Absolutely,' and I did and several of my officers joined me,"" Isaac said.Isaac spoke during a briefing Monday on the protests over the weekend, saying he and none of his staff believe what took place in Minneapolis was right and know law enforcement is more professional than that.""We have to move past this and those that have not made those necessary changes, they need to do that as well. I'm very proud of the work our men and women are doing,"" Isaac said. Protests in Cincinnati were largely peaceful Monday, scattered across the city's urban core and were relatively quiet, at least when compared to days prior.The protests are in honor of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, was killed after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota.A number of groups have been holding peaceful rallies to get the true message of their moment out, highlighting what they say are racial injustices and police brutality across the country. Organizers are asking participants to respect social distancing guidelines, wear masks and keep in groups no larger than 10 people.The protests have been followed by three nights of unrest in the city, with vandalism and looting during the first two nights.Isaac said he understands people are angry and he shares that anger and wants to talk about it.""It's never too late to talk. I understand that people are angry if we're not going to talk what's going to happen then, is this going to go on indefinitely. Yeah we need to talk; we need to talk about how to make things better; we need to talk about more reform; we need to listen to what the community is saying, particularly our young people; that's most important to me,"" Isaac said.Ohio State Sen. Cecil Thomas said his hope is that the protests continue peacefully in order for the true message to be heard.""The peaceful protesters. They done what they wanted to do. Obviously, they honored the curfew,"" Thomas said. ""Now there are people out who may be attempting to do things similar to what happened last night and the night before.""",0.0

Dover police said that at around 7:30 p.m. Sunday, as a large group arrived in the area of the Dover Mall on North DuPont Highway, officers were notified of several burglary alarms at the building. Police said looting suspects gained entry to the mall by breaking a glass door to Forever 21. Several people stole items from that location. Additional suspects entered the mall and damaged a security gate to gain access to other locations within the mall. Police said security gates and entry doors to T-Mobile and Foot Locker were both damaged, but the suspects did not gain access to those stores. According to police, suspects did gain access to the Villa Shoe store inside of the mall and stole a large amount of clothing and shoes from the business. Police said that at around 12:13 a.m. Monday, June 1, officers observed 40-year-old Corey Barlow, of Dover, in the downtown area with two new boxes of sneakers and a coat with tags still on it. Officers contacted Barlow and obtained his information as part of the ongoing investigation. At approximately 11 a.m. Monday, officers received another burglary alarm for Villa Shoe store. Upon arrival, it was learned that someone had entered the store through a damaged security gate. Police said it turned out to be Barlow, who was arrested inside the storage area of the store as he was attempting to steal more merchandise. Barlow was arrested on two counts of third-degree burglary, two counts of theft, and two counts of criminal mischief. A mugshot has not yet been made available. Sunday night's looting incidents followed a protest that happened in north Dover in which people called for justice in the death of George Floyd, who died in the custody of Minneapolis police. The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is asked to contact the Dover Police Department at 302-736-7130. Callers may remain anonymous. Tips may also be submitted to law enforcement through Delaware Crime Stoppers at 800-TIP-3333 or online at delawarecrimestoppers.com; a cash reward of up to $1,000 is possible for information leading to an arrest.",0.0

Throughout the history of the program, numerous primary ball handlers have put up big scoring totals, created highlight plays and led their team to greatness. But for a program loaded with point guard talent, who are the best of the best? Here's a look at a few of top point guards to ever be a Terp. Gene Shue (1951-54) Shue ranks No. 22 on Maryland's all-time scoring list, and while he put up some impressive numbers during his time there, his most impressive work was how he put the program on the map. Before Shue took his spot at UMD, the team had suffered losing season after losing season. That all changed when the point guard arrived. During his playing career, the Terps achieved their first 20-win season in program history, were nationally ranked and joined the ACC Conference. Thanks in large part to Shue, Maryland basketball began the journey toward national prominence. John Lucas (1972-76) Earning All-American honors once is an impressive feat for most college players, Lucas did it three times during his career at Maryland. The point guard earned second-team honors for the 1973-74 season while playing alongside Tom McMillen and Len Elmore. The latter two would graduate leaving Lucas to shine on his own in the following year. He did just that, earning First-Team All-American honors for the 1974-75 season. Lucas would do the same in 1975-76 for good measure. During that time he also led Maryland to an ACC regular-season title and an Elite Eight appearance. Lucas currently ranks No. 6 all-time in scoring at Maryland with 2,015 points. He also ranks No. 4 in scoring average, totaling around 18.3 points per game during his career as a Terp. Lucas wasn't just a scorer, as he also could pass with the best of them as a point guard. His 514 assists in college put him fifth on Maryland's all-time list. Lucas would go on to have a solid NBA career as well after being selected No. 1 overall by the Rockets in the 1976 NBA Draft. Keith Gatlin (1983-86, 1988) Gatlin embodied the floor general spirit of a point guard during his time at Maryland. Though surpassed 1,000 points in college, his real brilliance was seen when he distributed the ball to others. Len Bias and Adrian Branch ranked No. 3 and No. 5 on Maryland's scoring list, and that's largely due to Gatlin's ability to get them the ball and let them take over. Rather than force his own shots, Gatlin would find the open man and rack up assist totals. By the end of his Terrapin career, he had recorded 649 assists, good enough for third all-time in school history. Steve Blake (1999-2003) Blake, much like Gatlin, made his mark as a passer at Maryland. His 972 assists during his four-year college career are the highest mark in the history of the program and rank sixth all-time in NCAA basketball history. Blake's brilliance was seen from day one, as he started from his freshman to senior year at Maryland. His ability to control the flow of the game was instrumental in the Terps 2002 National Championship run. Greivis Vasquez (2006-10) The roar at the Xfinity Center when Vasquez tells the crowd he has ""Maryland Pride"" is all you need to know about how great his collegiate career was. The point guard showed promise in his first two seasons but really stepped up his game during his junior and senior years. In 2008-09, Vasquez led the Terrapins in almost every category on the stat sheet. The top spots for scoring, assists, rebounds, steals and minutes played all belonged to him. He followed that up with a senior year in which he scored close to 20 points per game and took home the Bob Cousy Award, given to the nation's best point guard. Vasquez currently ranks second all-time in points at Maryland with 2,171. Melo Trimble (2014-17) Trimble is one of the most recent guards to find success at Maryland. Bursting onto the scene as a freshman, Trimble averaged 16.2 points per game during his first season of college ball. His following two seasons were just as exciting, as Trimble became the go-to weapon for the Terps offense. Before it was all said and done, Trimble surpassed 1,600 points and 400 assists during his three years at Maryland. Numbers were great, but it was Trimble's heroic moments in the final seconds that he'll always be remembered for. Last-second game-winning shots against Wisconsin and Michigan State showed that there was no moment too big for No. 2. Anthony Cowan Jr. (2016-20) When Trimble left for the pros it became Cowan's time to shine at Maryland, and he did just that. After a solid freshman year, Cowan continued to grow and improve each time out on the court. From his sophomore to senior year Cowan averaged 15.8, 15.6 and 16.3 points, respectively. He now sits seventh all-time in scoring at the University of Maryland Cowan's biggest strengths, however, were his consistency and clutch. Maryland's newest 'Iron Man,' the point guard started 130 consecutive games during his four years as a Terp. No matter what was going on, everyone could rely on Cowan to be there and ready to make an impact. Clutch-wise, Cowan had a knack for stepping up in the big moments, especially during his senior season. A lethal three-point shooter, his performance on the road against Michigan State this past season showed everything there is to know about the Maryland native. With the Terps trailing late, Cowan knocked down two huge threes from way beyond the arc to take the lead and ice the game. Moments like that helped Cowan bring a Big Ten banner to College Park.

1623406899,2020-06-02 05:13:43,"UPDATED- With protest planned on Tuesday, Bethesda Row merchants board up businesses in advance",https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/bethesda/with-protest-planned-on-tuesday-bethesda-row-merchants-board-up-businesses-in-advance/,en,False,,316770,maryland.statenews.net,http://maryland.statenews.net/,"UPDATED: Protest planned on Tuesday; some Bethesda Row merchants board up businesses Black Lives Matter event will be at library at 1 p.m. By Dan Schere A crew boards up Pampillonia Jewelers in Bethesda Row on Monday. Other local shops (below) also were boarded up the day before a scheduled protest, which will be at Bethesda Library at 1 p.m. Tuesday. Photos by Matt McDonald Some Bethesda Row merchants were boarding up their businesses this week as they anticipate a peaceful protest on Tuesday — and whatever might happen that isn’t planned. Bethesda is the latest place scheduled to hold a protest over the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis. A white police officer investigating a call about someone using a fake $20 bill at a store pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck on the ground for several minutes, as shown in a video shot by a bystander. The officer has been charged with murder and manslaughter. A peaceful protest in response to Floyd’s death and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement is planned in Bethesda at 1 p.m. Tuesday in front of Bethesda Library at 7400 Arlington Road. Montgomery County police Second District Commander Sean Gagen, whose district includes Bethesda, wrote in a message to the Greater Bethesda Chamber of Commerce on Monday that he contacted a student organizer to discuss the protest and assure organizers that they are free to protest peacefully. “Police officers from the Montgomery County Police Department 2nd District and I will be at the Bethesda Library throughout the protest and there will be an increased police presence throughout the Bethesda Central Business District over the course of the protest,” Gagen wrote. Gagen added that businesses and others in the community should be aware of the increased number of officers in Bethesda’s central business district. In an interview Monday afternoon, Gagen said that there would be a “large presence” of officers throughout the Second District for the “foreseeable future.” “Out of an overabundance of caution, businesses are taking it upon themselves to protect their property. We plan on having an increased presence with our police officers down in the CBD (central business district) in Friendship Heights area and throughout the commercial establishments in the district,” he said. “So people should see a larger number of police cars than they normally would. But that’s us being proactive.” There have been days of protests in Washington, D.C., and cities across the country over Floyd’s death. In some cases, there have been confrontations between protesters and police. Some tense protests have devolved into rioting and looting. One example was in Friendship Heights in D.C. on Sunday night, at the Maryland-D.C. line. Rioters looted several businesses, including the Mazza Gallerie shopping mall on the D.C. side. Montgomery County police lined up to keep rioters out of the county. Gagen said on Monday that about 50 Montgomery County officers were at the scene on Sunday night. The officers included a mix of uniformed officers and others in riot gear from the department’s Special Events Response Team, or SERT. Gagen said he didn’t know of any violent protests expected Monday evening. John Fitzgerald, the chief of the Chevy Chase Village Police Department, near Friendship Heights, wrote in a statement Monday that he had communicated with both Montgomery County and D.C. police about planning for more possible protests. “Rest assured that Chevy Chase Village officers will be actively on patrol and monitoring the streets along the DC line, and the County Police will be sending multiple officers into the area as evening approaches to deter and respond to any criminal activity that might arise,” he wrote. Carolyn Weinberg, a part-owner of Quartermaine Coffee Roasters at 4817 Bethesda Ave., said in an interview Monday that her businesses would be boarded up starting at 4 p.m. “We’ve been watching the news and what’s happening in D.C. and many of us in Bethesda don’t want our businesses damaged, so we’re taking every precaution we can,” she said. Weinberg said her business will be open Tuesday morning, then will close when the protest starts. “We’ll close at 1, put the boards up and hope for the best,” she said. Weinberg said the nighttime protests that are violent are what she is worried about the most. “Mazza Gallerie is literally seven minutes from us. Not even,” she said, referring to Sunday night’s looting in Friendship Heights. The owner of Pampillonia Jewelers, at 7114 Bethesda Lane, also boarded up the storefront on Monday afternoon. A representative of the store said that even though everything is in a vault, large windows could get broken if protests get violent. “We’re just taking precautions, that’s all,” she said. Someone who identified herself as one of the organizers of the protest wrote in an email to Bethesda Beat on Monday morning that it will be peaceful and an important way to raise awareness. “We can no longer sit by and watch innocent black lives being taken,” she wrote. She had not responded as of Monday evening to an email seeking comment. Dan Schere can be reached at Daniel.schere@bethesdamagazine.com",0.0
1623406927,2020-06-02 03:04:29,Election Guide- Maryland Holds First Mail-In Primary On June 2 u2013 CBS Baltimore,https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2020/06/01/election-guide-maryland-holds-first-mail-in-primary-on-june-2/,en,False,,316770,maryland.statenews.net,http://maryland.statenews.net/,"  Maryland will hold its first mail-in primary on Tuesday, June 2. Marylanders will be casting primary ballots in the presidential race as well as some congressional and local races. In Baltimore, people will cast their primary ballots for the mayoral race (profiles below) as well as the 7th congressional district. The special election held on April 28 only covered the rest of the term left vacant by the late Rep. Elijah Cummings. Kweisi Mfume won that seat. >> LIVE ELECTION RESULTS << There are also six in-person voting locations in Baltimore for those who may not be able to vote via mail. RELATED STORIES: “We strongly encourage anyone who can vote by mail to do so,” said Linda Lamone, Maryland Administrator of Elections. “Voting by mail is safe, secure and free. There is no postage required to submit a ballot. Voters simply need to fill out their ballot, sign the oath on the envelope and place it back in the mail.” The returned ballot must be postmarked no later than June 2 but can be mailed at any time before election day. Voters should sign only the oath on the outside of the envelope but not the ballot itself. Eligible voters who have not already received a ballot in the mail may request a ballot by emailing absentee.SBE@maryland.gov or calling 1-800-222-8683. Here are the profiles for six of the mayoral candidates in Baltimore. The following locations will be open for in-person voting in Baltimore on June 2 from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mount Pleasant Church & Ministries, 6000 Radecke Avenue, Baltimore, Md. 21206 Edmondson High School, 501 N. Athol Avenue, Baltimore, Md. 21229 University of Maryland at Baltimore Community Engagement Center, 870 W. Baltimore Street, Baltimore, Md. 21201 Dr. Carter G. Woodson School #160, 2501 Seabury Road, Baltimore, Md. 21225 Northwestern High School #401, 6900 Park Heights Avenue, Baltimore, Md. 21215 Northwood Elementary School #242, 5201 Loch Raven Blvd., Baltimore, Md. 21239 On Monday, the hopefuls made their final pitches to voters. “This is the most important election in our lifetimes,” candidate Thiru Vignarajah said. “We’re in an unprecedented moment in our country,” candidate T.J. Smith said. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and unrest following the in-custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Smith, a former Baltimore Police Department spokesperson, said he’s prepared to work on de-escalation training for police officers and also strengthening community relations. “We saw a video of a police lieutenant reading off the names of people who have died in police custody. That’s a start, engaging with the community and empathizing with the community,” he said. With a stay-at-home order in place for much of what would have been the campaign season, candidates spent their time reaching out to voters through virtual debates and by phone. Former Mayor Sheila Dixon and former Obama administration official Mary Miller both cited the need to build upon the existing consent decree. “That is the blueprint for improving police practice, restoring constitutional and unbiased policing,” Miller said. “We also want to work towards resolving some of the issues we face between police and citizens. That trust has to be gained back,” Dixon said. Vignarajah argued he’s already proven he can deliver results at the state level. “When I was deputy attorney general, we became the first state in the country to issue new guidelines about how to end discriminatory profiling,” he said. City Council President Brandon Scott said he’s already leading the city toward better policing practices in his current role. He said he wants to open up internal affairs complaints and get local control over city police. “Where were my opponents five years ago when the city was burning? I know where I was; where were they?” he said. The state elections board said it will release some of the results by 8 p.m. Tuesday, including from ballots counted between May 21 and May 30. Each ballot received from May 31 on will be counted a day after the election up until June 12. Incumbent Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young canceled an interview with WJZ Monday, citing preparations for demonstrations in the city.

Photo by Dan Schere Chevy Chase residents gathered in Norwood Local Park Monday evening for a silent vigil in memory of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis last month. Floyd died on May 25 after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, pressed his knee onto the neck of Floyd, who was on the ground. A bystander’s video of that encounter showed that it lasted close to nine minutes. Chauvin was responding to a call for someone using counterfeit money at a store. The officer has since been charged with murder and manslaughter. Monday night’s peaceful vigil was one of several that have occurred throughout the country in the past several days. Attendees were silent for nine minutes to symbolize the approximate amount of time Chauvin pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck. Many knelt down on their knees to show solidarity with the African American community, in a gesture that has been used to protest police brutality. The crowd, which organizers estimated in the hundreds, included people of different ages gathered in small groups. They maintained social distancing as a precaution to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Many brought candles. Jessica Nassau, who came with her husband and her daughter, said she found out about the event earlier that day on a neighborhood listserv. “I know it’s not as big and vocal as some of the other protests. It just felt like something that was close to home and safe to bring kids to. Something to show a small sign of support,” she said. Susan Baron, who helped organize the vigil earlier that day, said organizers put out a flyer at noon asking people to come to the park for a silent vigil. They asked attendees to wear masks and maintain proper physical distancing. “A number of us in the last week have looked at each other and said, ‘What can we do, given COVID?’ You’re somewhat limited in what you can do to express your pain or sympathy,” she said. “It’s so heartening and awesome, and it really is an expression where people want to find a place to let it be known to the families that have suffered. This isn’t just about George Floyd. … It’s that his death is on the shoulders of so many others [whose deaths] before him were so senseless and tragic.” Baron’s daughter, Zoe Ibson, who brought a Black Lives Matter sign, helped her mother distributes leaflets at houses on Monday. Ibson said it’s important for people in Chevy Chase, a predominantly white community, to show solidarity with the African American community. “This specifically being a very affluent white community, it’s really important to come together and have a collective consciousness about the lives that are being lost,” she said.

It's president. Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. The president urging states to dominate the situation, calling the nation's Governors Week in a Monday conference call and going a step further during his prepared remarks. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. That message received immediate pushback. I say Thank you, but no, thank you. I care more about them. Then some of the noise I heard on a morning focal. Meanwhile, after protesters were cleared, the president walking across the street to ST John's Episcopal Church, which was damaged in a fire Sunday, stopping to hold up a Bible, a move condemned by church officials. I just can't believe what my eyes see tonight, Advertisement What you need to know about your rights if you're planning to take part in protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Every American has the right to demonstrate peacefully. It's right there in the First Amendment. But it's not as simple as showing up with a sign.There are some measures officials can use to limit protests, and it's easy to accidentally tiptoe into legally murky territory if you don't know the specifics.So before you go, read up.Timothy Zick is a professor of government and citizenship at the College of William & Mary Law School. He specializes in constitutional law and the First Amendment, and he's written several books about both, including 2009's ""Speech Out of Doors: Preserving First Amendment Liberties in Public Spaces.""Emerson Sykes is a staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Technology and Privacy Project, who studies free speech protections under the First Amendment. Previously, he worked for Africa at the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law to protect free speech.1. What are my rights as a protester?The First Amendment gives Americans the right to assemble peacefully and air our grievances. Historically, we've relied on protests to hold power to account — think the March on Washington in 1963 for civil rights or the March for Our Lives demonstration in 2018 for gun control.The government can't stop you from peacefully protesting, but they can impose some restrictions on the time, place and manner of the protest — for example, barring protesters from walking onto a public highway or instituting a curfew that affects when protests end, Sykes said.They can't block a protest simply because of its content, though.If protests are planned in advance, organizers may obtain a permit so law enforcement can block off public spaces for them to demonstrate, Sykes said.There are protections, though, for ""spontaneous protests"" that spawn in response to current events, like the protests that spawned after George Floyd's death, he said.The First Amendment does not continue to protect protests that escalate to violence or the destruction of private or public property, he said.That's when law enforcement has the right to end them and deescalate threats of violence, he said.2. Where can and can't I protest?A slew of public spaces are OK for protests — sidewalks, city parks, streets and other public forums are usually lawful, Sykes said.Some states require you file a permit to block off streets, and the right to assembly doesn't give you the automatic right to march on a public highway, Zick said.People can be arrested or cited for blocking passage, he said.On private property, you don't have the right to assemble.Zick called it the ""no man's land"" in terms of the First Amendment, and police can move you off the property and keep you from demonstrating there.They may even have that right to move you even if you're on public property. Special rules apply to government buildings because protests may disrupt business going on inside, Sykes said.If the protest was permitted, you should be allowed to stay where you are — but leaving the permitted protest site may unintentionally lead you into prohibited places, he said.3. Can police or local leaders tell us to disperse?It depends, Sykes said: If a mayor pleads with people to go home, you have no legal obligation to comply.But police and local government can order you to leave, say, if they've imposed a curfew, as long as they give you ample notice to leave safely, Sykes said.If you stay on the street past a curfew — or if you protest on private property — you may be cited or arrested.4. What can I record?You have the right to take photos and videos of what's happening at a protest in a public place, and you can record police, too.Different states have different rules about audio recording and sharing that without the consent of the people whose voices you recorded, but the visual portion of videos and photos are always protected by the First Amendment, Sykes said.If you're interfering with legitimate police operations, they can ask you to move. It's best to videotape them from a safe distance.Police can't ask you to give them your phone or forcibly confiscate it without a search warrant, which they would've needed to obtain from a judge, he said.If they demand your phone, though, comply to avoid escalating the confrontation. Afterward, you can file a police misconduct complaint or contact the ACLU, he said.5. Someone took a picture of my face at a public protest. Is that allowed?At a public protest in the United States, you consent to a photo just by being there. Anyone who photographs you protesting in a public place may have a right to use your image, and you may see images of yourself in the media or online, Zick said.6. What should I pack to stay safe at a protest?Pack light, Sykes said. He suggests you bring water and a snack at minimum. If you bring a bag, prepare for it to be searched.In a pandemic, wearing a mask can keep you from breathing in droplets containing coronavirus. Coming within close contact of other protesters could expose you to their spit or sneezes, which may carry the coronavirus.Of course, keep an ID on your person, too.And if you fear you'll be arrested and will need legal help, memorize the number to a local or national law organization that could assist you in getting out of jail and handling your case afterward, Sykes said.7. What can — and can't — police do during a protest?It's the responsibility of police to protect your right to peaceful assembly.They're also empowered to uphold law and order, which gives them broad authority to deescalate threats of violence how they see fit.How they deescalate that violence depends on local laws and the circumstances under which they use them, which can be difficult to prove in court if you believe they used force unlawfully, Zick said.Like Sykes said, police do not have the right to search your phone or personal devices without a warrant, which only a judge can grant them.They also don't have permission to delete content from your phone, so if they tell you to delete a video you took or delete it themselves, they're in the wrong, he said.8. What can I do if a police officer stops me?Be polite. Don't resist.Ask them if you're free to go after speaking with them, Sykes said.If they say yes, calmly walk away and rejoin the protest if it's safe to.If they say no, and they detain you, don't resist and keep calm, Sykes said. Ask them what crime you're suspected of committing.9. What can I do if I get arrested?Some people get arrested intentionally as a form of civil disobedience. But whether or not you planned to get handcuffed, you shouldn't resist arrest, Sykes said.It's the best chance you have to stay safe.During your arrest, you can remain silent, as is your right, Sykes said.In some states, police are permitted to know your name if they ask, but they don't have the right to know where you're from or your citizenship status, he said.You can also ask for a lawyer — remember that number you held onto for legal support.If you're booked into jail, call a lawyer immediately, Sykes said.Police can't listen in on your call if you're phoning a lawyer, but they can listen in if you're calling a friend or family member, so be aware, he said.10. What can I do if I feel law enforcement or other officials violated my rights?You can sue for civil rights violations.You're allowed to do that under Section 1983 of federal law, which covers violations by state actors and police who violate First Amendment rights to assemble, speak and petition.Some protesters file large class-action suits that are occasionally successful, and sometimes authorities can pay damages when they decide litigation isn't worth it, Zick said.But qualified immunity can shield officers from civil liability if they didn't violate a clearly established law, he said.Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that protects police officers accused of interfering with constitutional rights from being liable unless they violated a clearly established and defined law.The lines are blurred at protests of what police are allowed to do and what constitutes overreaching, so ""clearly established"" constitutional rights are difficult to determine, Zick said.In this way, many police officers are protected by qualified immunity, Sykes said.""Those cases are difficult to win and expensive in terms of personal time and resources,"" Zick said. ""Naturally, I think a lot of the protesters whose rights may well have been violated may not pursue cases.""11. Can my workplace fire me if they find out I attended a protest?That depends on the contract you made with your employer when you were hired, but yes, it's possible, Sykes said.You have stronger constitutional protections for what you do outside of work, but depending on what you agreed on when you were hired, a company may be able to terminate your employment, he said.",0.0

Hogan: Baltimore Protest Response An Example For Nation Gov. Larry Hogan said Tuesday he ""couldn't be more proud"" of what happened in Baltimore on Monday as hundreds of peaceful protesters marched through downtown, up the Jones Falls Expressway and to police headquarters. Only six people were arrested Monday night, four for failure to obey a lawful order, one for throwing fireworks and another for carrying a long gun. ""First of all, I think that the citizens of Baltimore, just having gone through that, the pain of that 2015, did not want to see it happen again,"" Hogan told C4. ""It was something you did not see around the country and there was so much cooperation. There was a handful of these extremists who had a violent agenda and most of the people, protesters were stopping them for days from doing the things they were doing in other cities, which was fantastic."" The days after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray were marked by clashes between protesters and law enforcement. The violence quelled after, at the request of then-Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency and dispatched the national guard and police agencies from across the state. Hogan didn't need to marshal that kind of response this time and said much of the credit lies with Mayor Bernard C. ""Jack"" Young, Baltimore police, state law enforcement agencies and the Maryland National Guard. On Monday, President Donald Trump chastised governors for being ""weak"" in responding to protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He then said he would invoke a 19th-century law to dispatch troops to states where governors have not yet activated the National Guard. ""I don't think that we need federal troops and I don't think that there are going to be federal troops and I don't think, I'm not sure that the president can send federal troops except if it's at the request of the governor,"" Hogan said. Hogan said the work of city police and involvement by community activists has helped keep property damage and other violence at a minimum. Hogan conceded that the mass protests run counter to the idea of social distancing during the COVID-19 crisis. However, he noted that many people out on the streets were wearing masks in line with state and federal guidelines. ""Hopefully, it's not going to be bad but it's definitely something our scientists and doctors are worrying about."" Besides the concerns about possible transmission during the protests, Hogan said coronavirus metrics remain on the downswing. The positivity rate of tests being conducted has dipped to 10.5%. Hospitalizations, deaths and intensive care stays are also down.",0.0

Advertisement Police take a knee, drawing cheers, support from protesters in Fort Worth, Texas Share Shares Copy Link Copy Despite some tense moments during protests in Fort Worth, Texas, officers and the police chief drew praise when they kneeled with protesters to show support.Protesters there voiced concerns once again Monday night, drawing attention to deaths of black people by police officers. But when a black police officer responding to the crowds kneeled to show support and other officers joined, a crowd erupted into praise, prompting protesters to shake the hands of police and hug them. Protesters in Fort Worth have been noting deaths such as George Floyd, who died on Memorial Day in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes. The officer, who was since fired, now faces third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.Crowds there also have called attention to Atatiana Jefferson, whose family said she was playing video games with her nephew when a Fort Worth officer shot her in her home in October. The officer resigned and has been indicted on a murder charge. Later Monday, police in riot gear responded to the crowds, causing confusion, but police chief Ed Kraus took a knee and prayed with people, and officers in riot gear later did, too, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.""I think it's a good step,"" Kraus said.

""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. ""More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that's what the presidency is: the duty to care — to care for all of us."" On Monday evening, Trump walked from the White House across Lafayette Square to hold a Bible in front of St. John's Church, after peaceful protesters were forcibly cleared from the park. (The U.S. Park Police say they used smoke canisters, not tear gas, though it's not clear if another law enforcement agency engaged there used other munitions.) The forceful dispersal began before the Washington, D.C., curfew had begun, and the bishop overseeing the church has harshly criticized Trump for appearing for photos without praying or addressing the racial issues at the heart of nationwide protests. Trump made the trip after making a speech in which he threatened to deploy the military to states and cities that do not quell violence. ""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it,"" Biden said. ""If he opened it, he could have learned something: that we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump isn't interested in doing that work."" Biden echoed the words spoken by George Floyd, the black man whose death while in custody of Minneapolis police has led to the widespread unrest. The words ""I can't breathe,"" Biden said, ""are a wake-up call for our nation."" Biden addressed police abuses and economic disparities that affect what he called ""communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time"" — alluding to the since-charged police officer who had his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. ""The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism,"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said. He asked Congress to take up measures he called ""a down payment on what is long overdue,"" including police reform bills outlawing chokeholds, banning the transfer of military weapons to police forces and establishing a uniform use of force standard. He said he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president. Biden also called for expanding the Affordable Care Act to millions more Americans, saying that Trump, who has long opposed the law, is ""consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to [former President] Barack Obama."" Obama's former vice president reiterated what he has long said on the 2020 campaign trail, that there is a ""battle for the soul of America."" ""Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears,"" Biden said. ""He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being that he leads. ""The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either,"" Biden said. ""But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate."" In a statement following his remarks, Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign adviser, said Biden has ""obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy."" She added: ""Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has used the politics of racial division when they suited his needs and he is doing it again."" On Monday, Biden held his first in-person campaign event since the coronavirus took hold in the United States in mid-March. He met with African American faith leaders in Wilmington, Del., listening to at-times critical feedback from the group. Many of the invited guests chided Biden for a political system that has delivered ""hopelessness"" to young African Americans. They told him the Obama administration had not done enough to economically lift black Americans, something Biden then promised would be a centerpiece of any recovery plan from the administration.

According to the news station, the owner of Firing Line Inc. told police that someone tried to break in over the weekend, so he decided to spend the night at the store. He was watching surveillance video around 4 a.m. Tuesday when he saw three or four people use bolt cutters to enter through the back door. When the group got to the second floor, the owner opened fire and hit one of the men in the head, police said. The man died at the scene. “One of the males pointed a gun at the owner, and that’s when the owner of the gun shop, who was in possession of one of his guns, fired several shots, striking the one male at least one time in the head,” said Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Scott Small. Police recovered a semi-automatic handgun near the man, reported KYW. The others fled the store. Investigators said one person who may be connected to the incident showed up at a local hospital with a gunshot wound to the shoulder. Investigators are working to determine if he was involved in the burglary. Nothing was taken, and the 67-year-old store owner was not injured, said police. Police said the men likely will face charges of burglary, but they could be charged with looting due to the current unrest over the death of George Floyd. MORE NEWS ON WDVM",0.0

(Photo: Tayla Cunningham) UPDATE 7:35 A.M. The fourth day of protests in Richmond started out peacefully, but quickly turned into chaos when Richmond Police officers deployed tear gas on a crowd near the Robert E. Lee statue on Monument Avenue. Video shows that tear has was deployed around 7:30 p.m. — Richmond’s curfew starts at 8 p.m. Shortly after 8 p.m., police tweeted that officers were cut off by violent protesters and that the gas was necessary to get them to safety. To our peaceful protestors: We are sorry we had to deploy gas near the Lee Monument. Some RPD officers in that area were cut off by violent protestors. The gas was necessary to get them to safety. — Richmond Police (@RichmondPolice) June 2, 2020 But later at 9:47 p.m., Richmond Police sent out another tweet saying that the tear gas was unwarranted. According to police, the officers were pulled from the field and will be disciplined. Chief Smith just reviewed video of gas being deployed by RPD officers near the Lee Monument and apologizes for this unwarranted action. These officers have been pulled from the field. They will be disciplined because their actions were outside dept protocols and directions given. — Richmond Police (@RichmondPolice) June 2, 2020 Mayor Stoney said on Twitter that he wants to apologize in person to the protesters who were tear-gassed. He is asking them to attend a meeting outside of City Hall today at noon. “Words cannot make this right, and words cannot restore that trust broke this evening,” the Mayor said on Twitter. “Only action. Only action will repair this community. Come to City Hall tomorrow at noon. I want to say sorry. I want to listen.” In response to the tear gassing, Congressman A. Donald E. McEachin said on Twitter, “…There is no excuse or justification for tear gassing a lawful, peaceable protest, a protest about stopping police brutality.” WATCH: Tuesday’s full event outside Richmond City Hall (Warning: Video contains profanity) Reporter Kerri O’Brien also contributed to this report.",0.0

Larry Hogan tweeted that the city continues to be an example for the nation on how to protest for meaningful change. He also acknowledged the country has some work to do to end systemic racism. “The senseless murder of George Floyd and so many African Americans throughout our history shows we still have a long way to go to live up to our nation’s highest ideals,” Hogan tweeted. “But I’m proud that Baltimore is showing the nation how we can begin to build a more perfect union.” He thanked Baltimore Mayor Jack Young, Commissioner Michael Harrison, state and local police, the National Guard and the MTA as well as Baltimore residents and community leaders “who are showing the power of a strong, compassionate, and united community.” The senseless murder of George Floyd and so many African Americans throughout our history shows we still have a long way to go to live up to our nation’s highest ideals.

The organizers simply known as “The Youth”, told WJZ they quickly mobilized after Floyd’s death to organize this event as a show of solidarity. “We witnessed a powerful display of Democracy as more than a thousand people took to the streets of Baltimore without any major incidents,” said Mayor Jack Young. Thousands gathered Monday to protest police brutality, systemic racism and to mark injustices against black Americans. The youth-led protest started with hundreds of people near the Baltimore Convention Center around 4 p.m. and swelled to thousands outside City Hall. Protesters chanted and spoke the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and others who lost their lives senselessly. George Floyd Protests: 6 Arrested Overnight, Including 74-Year-Old Woman And Man With Long Gun, After Protesters Clash With Police In Baltimore At one point, some Baltimore police officers took a knee to show solidarity with the protesters. But around 10:30 p.m., as the group dwindled in size, tensions began to rise as police tried to disperse crowds in riot gear. It stemmed from reports that some were throwing fireworks and water bottles at the line of officers and protesters. Maryland State Police was called in to help. “They were pointing out the people who had the stuff and dragging them over to police and saying arrest them,” Hogan said. According to police, the person who was arrested for allegedly setting off fireworks does not live in the city. Police tried several tactics to get the crowd to disperse, but around 2 a.m. they threatened to arrest anyone remaining. At least six people were arrested in total Monday.

Among those arrested was 74-year-old Anne Blumenberg, of the 3600 block of Greenmount Avenue, for failure to obey. RELATED STORIES: Thirty-year-old Tabitha Asten, of the unit block of Cross Falls Circle in Sparks, 28-year-old Jacob Vincent, of the 200 block of Michele Court, and 26-year-old Felix Bawo Gbubemi, of the unit block of Christina Lynn Court, were also arrested for failure to obey. George Augusta Patterson Jr, 37, of the 2300 block of KoKo Lane, was arrested without incident while carrying a long gun. Dyllan Hildebrand, 28, of the 1900 block of Stanhope Road in Dundalk, was arrested for allegedly throwing fireworks. The arrests occurred late Monday into early Tuesday when police and protesters clashed near City Hall. When taking into consideration the more than 1,000 demonstrators at events throughout the evening, Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said the low number of arrests “speaks volumes about the restraint displayed by both sides.” Officers saw people setting off illegal fireworks and throwing objects near other protesters and police downtown, prompting city police to call Maryland State Police for backup. Tuesday afternoon, police shared video of a group of demonstrators turning a person in to officers after setting off an M-80 firework near a line of officers, Harrison said. “Baltimore stood up and refused to let decisive and subversive agendas and actions hurt their city and cloud the message of peace and the message of change,” the commissioner said. WATCH: Protesters Turn In Person Who Threw Firework At Police Police were seen lined up in riot gear in a standoff with protesters. They tried several tactics to disperse the crowd and some worked as the crowd began to dwindle. But a smaller group of protesters remained, many still peaceful with their hands in the air, saying “Don’t Shoot.” It put a damper on a day that had been overwhelmingly peaceful. Thousands of protesters gathered peacefully downtown in Baltimore, shutting down major roadways Monday evening, as they marched through the city to protest police brutality and systemic racism after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd died on Memorial Day following an encounter with Minneapolis police. Cell phone video of his arrest showed former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for several minutes as he pleaded for help, telling Chauvin and other officers he couldn’t breathe. Gov. Larry Hogan tweeted that Baltimore set an example for our nation. “Thousands of young people and community leaders expressed their frustrations peacefully, while working with police to stand up to a handful of extremists with a violent agenda. This is how real, positive change happens,” Hogan tweeted. Yesterday, Baltimore set an example for our nation.

The city took down the more than 50-foot-tall obelisk following protests over the police death of George Floyd and a night of vandalism in the city. (AP Photo/Jay Reeves) BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — The base of a massive Confederate monument in Alabama’s largest city was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal and a bare flagpole. Workers hired by the city of Birmingham began removing the top portion of the 115-year-old monument from Linn Park late Monday. By daybreak, the pedestal was the only thing left, covered with graffiti and pock marks from protests against police brutality. Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in a racist church bombing that killed three other black girls in the city in 1963, came to see the remains. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the sight. “I’m glad it’s been removed because it has been so long. It’s a hate monument,” said Rudolph. She was seriously injured in the blast at 16th Street Baptist Church, and testified against Ku Klux Klansmen who were convicted in the killings. Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by the death in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Now even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham finally took action about a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests. Live video from overnight showed a flatbed truck hauling off the stone pieces in the early morning hours. It’s unclear where they were being taken. Crews were expected to return later Tuesday to finish the job, a city official said. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state. Alabama authorities said Birmingham would face a $25,000 assessment for violating a state law that bans the removal of such monuments. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the fine would be much more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Work to remove the monument began on Monday, which happened to be Alabama’s holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in on the steps of the state Capitol in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him, news outlets reported. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city’s only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled “Appomattox,” it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying “Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving.”",0.0

By the time the workers paused Tuesday morning, little was left of a spire that had become a lightning rod for controversy in recent years and a focal point for local protesters outraged by George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis. On Sunday, the obelisk — known formally as the Confederate Sailors and Soldiers Monument — was the site of a speech from Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, who pleaded with the crowd. Some protesters had already vandalized the monument and toppled another statue in the park, that one of former Confederate officer Charles Linn. Woodfin asked that demonstrators refrain from trying to tear down the much larger monument — so that his government could do it instead. ""Allow me to finish the job for you,"" the mayor told a crowd behind his mask and a megaphone. And he persuaded them to give him until midday Tuesday to pull the monument down. ""I wanted you to hear it directly from me. But I need you to stand down."" On Monday, Woodfin declared a state of emergency and implemented a curfew for the city, citing the previous night's protests during which police arrested at least two dozen people. Birmingham isn't the only city reckoning with its Confederate past in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Since the release of a video showing the black man's arrest in Minneapolis, during which a white officer plants a knee on Floyd's neck, protesters in several cities and towns below the Mason-Dixon Line have directed their frustration — and sometimes vandalism — toward local Confederate monuments. In Alexandria, Va., a statue commemorating Confederate soldiers came down Tuesday morning. It was removed a month earlier than scheduled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy due to fears of vandalism, according to The Washington Post. Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving. pic.twitter.com/CZTjlOkpfT — Justin Wilson (@justindotnet) June 2, 2020 This week's move likely isn't the final chapter in the Birmingham monument's story, which was knotty well before the latest spasm of unrest trained attention back on it. Woodfin's predecessor, William Bell, ordered the memorial partly hidden with plywood screens in 2017 following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued the city, citing a violation of a state law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, which protects against the relocation or alteration of Confederate symbols that have been up for more than four decades. A unanimous state Supreme Court decision last fall sided with the monument's supporters, bringing the plywood down and assessing a fine of $25,000 against the city of Birmingham. Now Marshall has threatened another lawsuit over the city's move. ""Should the City of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today,"" the attorney general said in a statement issued Monday, ""city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the [Alabama Memorial Preservation] Act to pursue a new civil complaint against the City.""

On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee begins the first of a planned series of hearings on the origins of the FBI's 2016 Russia investigation into possible ties with the Trump campaign. Republicans are particularly interested in the decision-making inside the Obama-Biden administration. Further, the Senate Homeland Security Committee late last month approved a subpoena along party lines for Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. ""The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the U.S. who is currently trying to be president got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $80,000 a month,"" said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, accused the committee's chairman, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., of abusing his power to aid Trump. ""We're in the middle of the worst public health and economic crisis in a century,"" he said, ""and what is Senator Johnson focused on? Running a political errand for Donald Trump by wasting Homeland Security Committee time and resources attempting to resurrect a craven, previously-debunked smear against Vice President Biden."" It is the allegation at the heart of Trump's impeachment — the president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and conspiracy theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and in December 2019, Trump was impeached for abuse of power by the House of Representatives for making the ask. The Senate acquitted the president in February after a contentious trial. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans using the Senate to try to help get Trump reelected. ""There are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee's attention but instead this committee is doing the president's personal bidding,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a potential contender to be Biden's running mate. During the first Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, senators will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., plans to subpoena 53 individuals, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former director of national intelligence James Clapper — all frequent Trump political targets. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had generally avoided weighing in on these investigations, but he fully embraced them in a recent Senate floor speech. ""No matter what some Washington Democrats may try to claim, you are not crazy or a conspiracy theorist if you see a pattern of institutional unfairness towards this president. You would have to be blind not to see one,"" he said. Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley, who testified against Trump's impeachment in the House, said investigations can be political and still have merit. ""I certainly believe that the oversight interests are stronger when you're looking at things like the Russia investigation. The Burisma controversy presents a more challenging question, however, I tend to favor some inquiry."" As vulnerable House Democrats experienced during impeachment, high-profile partisan inquiries can spark political backlash when voters have more urgent concerns — like the pandemic, the economy and social unrest.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Senate Republicans are launching investigations involving the Obama administration and President Obama's vice president, the presumptive Democratic nominee this time, Joe Biden. Today the Senate Judiciary Committee is beginning hearings on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. Republicans are also investigating what they claim is questionable dealings by the Biden family, although there's no evidence to support those CLAIMS. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis has this preview. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Senate Republicans haven't always shared President Trump's interest in investigating Joe Biden. Those days are over. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK SCOTT: The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the United States, who is currently trying to be president, got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $30,000 - or $80,000 a month. DAVIS: Florida Senator Rick Scott joined every Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month to vote for a subpoena of Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. A spokesman for the Biden campaign has accused Republicans of, quote, ""running a political errand"" for the president. This allegation is at the heart of Trump's impeachment. The president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and unfounded theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and Trump was impeached for abuse of power for making the ask. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans now using the Senate to try to boost Trump's reelection chances. Here's California Senator Kamala Harris. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: There are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee's attention. But instead, this committee is doing the president's personal bidding. DAVIS: Today, in the Judiciary Committee, Republicans hold their first oversight hearing into the decision-making process inside the Obama-Biden administration around the FBI investigation of Trump associates during the 2016 campaign. They will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham plans to issue subpoenas for 53 individuals, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, all frequent Trump targets.

At a Saturday afternoon press conference, Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young and City Council President Brandon Scott applauded the largely peaceful demonstrations and urged “outside agitators” to stay away. “There is an incredible amount of pain running through our country right now, and I understand that,” Young said. “I’m angry and frustrated and fed up.” “I want you to demand justice, I want you to speak up for change, I want you to hold us accountable,” he continued. “But you must do it lawfully.” It was a rare moment of collaboration for the two, who have frequently clashed as they compete in the June 2 Democratic primary. “Baltimore, I come before you today not just as your Council President, but as a tired young black man,” Scott said. “Being black in America is exhausting. If you’re outside of Baltimore thinking about coming, do us a favor. Stay home. We don’t want you here. You didn’t come to Baltimore after 2015. We don’t want you here now.” Scott was seen outside of City Hall last night as hundreds thronged the plaza in front of the building and maintained an edgy standoff with city police clad in riot gear. Young, who did not make an appearance at the scene, sent tweets last night condemning “agitators” and encouraging citizens to be “peaceful and productive” and finally to just “go home.” Here’s what some other Baltimore mayoral candidates had to say: Dixon: “I stand in solidarity” Former Mayor Sheila Dixon, writing on Twitter, said she is praying for the city and nation. She was one of the only candidates to address the need for physical distancing as the protests coincide with the coronavirus pandemic. “Protesting is a powerful tool for demanding justice and expressing dissatisfaction with systems that have failed black and brown communities far too many times,” she wrote. “I stand in solidarity with those protesting peacefully but urge participants to not destroy resources/stores that support our community.” “I will continue my commitment to work diligently to dismantle systemic injustices,” she continued. “Please stay safe and practice social distancing while out. Let’s lift each other up in these trying times.” Miller: “Thoroughly justified” Mary Miller, whose association with a PAC trying to get her elected by targeting the white vote has brought her under scrutiny, perhaps had extra pressure to issue a strong statement on Floyd’s death and police misconduct. In an email to supporters, she called the unarmed Minneapolis man’s death after a city police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes “murder.” “The thoroughly justified anguish and outrage Black Americans across this country – and in Baltimore – are feeling after the murder of George Floyd and centuries of oppression, serves to remind us that police brutality and racism are still with us.” She continued. “I support the right to protest for change. In the coming days, I pray for peaceful protest here in Baltimore, and I pray for justice for George Floyd. In the long term, I pray for a culture where Black people do not live in fear of their neighbors or those meant to protect them, where law enforcement coexists and engages safely with communities of color, and where Black Lives Matter.” “I’m also taught that faith without works is dead,” Miller said, pivoting to her familiar campaign pledge to promote “systems of accountability” as mayor, such as the current consent decree between Baltimore Police and the U.S. Department of Justice. Vignarajah: “Ruthless murder” Thiru Vignarajah, who has vigorusly campaigned on a pledge to reduce violent crime in Baltimore, had this to say on Twitter: “Some cases do not have two sides. The murder of George Floyd should be charged, prosecuted and discussed as what it was – a ruthless murder. The anger across the country is deserved. A man’s life was snuffed out on camera, echoing countless scenes as old as American history.” Vignarajah later touted his connection to Gary Tuggle, Baltimore’s “renowned” acting police commissioner for 11 months (May 2018 to March 2019) who has endorsed his candidacy. Smith: “I felt a lot of that pain” Former BPD spokesman T.J. Smith, who is also running in the primary, addressed Floyd’s death, saying, “I’m angry and sad at the same time.” “Even before George Floyd was murdered, this week has shown us how racism and implicit bias rears it’s ugly head,” he tweeted, linking to an earlier Instagram post in which he talks about the black man birdwatching in Central Park who a white female dogwalker called the police on. “I’ve been pulled over by the police as the police and questioned about why I’m in a certain area,” Smith said, also describing an incident 20 years ago in which he said he was “profiled” and stopped for alleged shoplifting. “I felt a lot of that pain,” he said.

They urged protesters to take a peaceful approach this time. Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young said he believes outsiders instigated the violence in 2015 and called on Baltimoreans to reject outside agitation to violence. “I can’t have our city turn into chaos,” he said. “We will not let outside influence come into the city of Baltimore and commit chaos in our city.” Protests Friday night in Baltimore were generally peaceful, though police say they are investigating a video showing an officer punching out a woman after she struck another officer. Saturday’s protests began in the afternoon and were larger. At one point, officers had to barricade City Hall as a crowd gathered outside.

Hogan: Baltimore Protest Response An Example For Nation Gov. Larry Hogan said Tuesday he ""couldn't be more proud"" of what happened in Baltimore on Monday as hundreds of peaceful protesters marched through downtown, up the Jones Falls Expressway and to police headquarters. Only six people were arrested Monday night, four for failure to obey a lawful order, one for throwing fireworks and another for carrying a long gun. ""First of all, I think that the citizens of Baltimore, just having gone through that, the pain of that 2015, did not want to see it happen again,"" Hogan told C4. ""It was something you did not see around the country and there was so much cooperation. There was a handful of these extremists who had a violent agenda and most of the people, protesters were stopping them for days from doing the things they were doing in other cities, which was fantastic."" The days after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray were marked by clashes between protesters and law enforcement. The violence quelled after, at the request of then-Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency and dispatched the national guard and police agencies from across the state. Hogan didn't need to marshal that kind of response this time and said much of the credit lies with Mayor Bernard C. ""Jack"" Young, Baltimore police, state law enforcement agencies and the Maryland National Guard. On Monday, President Donald Trump chastised governors for being ""weak"" in responding to protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He then said he would invoke a 19th-century law to dispatch troops to states where governors have not yet activated the National Guard. ""I don't think that we need federal troops and I don't think that there are going to be federal troops and I don't think, I'm not sure that the president can send federal troops except if it's at the request of the governor,"" Hogan said. Hogan said the work of city police and involvement by community activists has helped keep property damage and other violence at a minimum. Hogan conceded that the mass protests run counter to the idea of social distancing during the COVID-19 crisis. However, he noted that many people out on the streets were wearing masks in line with state and federal guidelines. ""Hopefully, it's not going to be bad but it's definitely something our scientists and doctors are worrying about."" Besides the concerns about possible transmission during the protests, Hogan said coronavirus metrics remain on the downswing. The positivity rate of tests being conducted has dipped to 10.5%.

The American Identitarian Movement says it prohibits violence and illegal activity.CNN has reached out to the group for comment.Twitter said it had shut down other fake accounts linked to Identity Evropa, too.The phenomenon of people on the right creating fake Antifa accounts predates the current wave of protests.

(AP)- An angry crowd shouted down Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney Tuesday after police lobbed tear gas at a group of peaceful demonstrators during a protest over the death of George Floyd. Several hundred people gathered outside City Hall, chanted “FIRE THEM!” and repeatedly drowned out Stoney as he apologized and promised that the officers involved will face disciplinary action. Video posted to social media of the Monday night incident shows a line of police launching tear gas toward a group of protesters, who appeared to be yards away from the officers and peacefully gathered on the grass near the statue. Police Chief William Smith also apologized and also took a knee briefly after being invited to do so by a woman in the crowd. ",0.0

Four people were charged with failure to obey, including a 74-year-old Baltimore woman. A Dundalk man was arrested for throwing fireworks, and a 37-year-old city resident was “arrested while carrying a long gun,” according to the statement released by Baltimore Police Department today. During a day in which large crowds chanting “No justice, no peace!” marched in memory of George Floyd – the black Minneapolis man killed after a police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes – Baltimore police stayed mostly in the background. Police messaging on social media, however, prompted some criticism, especially a Tweet posted by @BaltimorePolice at 2:29 p.m. that said: “The BPD is committed to protecting rights and facilitating peaceful protests to ensure the safety of everyone. Small stashes of potential weapons have been located. If you see something, say something.” Some questioned the reference to “stashes of potential weapons” having been located. “Show us,” Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson tweeted back. There was no reply from police. Protesters were able to march without incident through city streets, at one point shutting down I-83 in both directions. At War Memorial Plaza, the crowd continued the demonstration in front of City Hall, calling for an end to racist policing and reciting the names of other unarmed black people killed by police – Ahmed Aubrey in Florida, Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and many others. • A vivid description of last night, tweeted by activist @SefuChikelu . Drama on Baltimore Street About 9:30 p.m., a group of demonstrators headed south from City Hall toward the Inner Harbor, but were stopped at Baltimore and Commerce streets by city officers in riot gear. An uneasy truce ensued for the next two hours. Fireworks were thrown at police and, at one point, one of the throwers was chased by members of the crowd. “He was lighting fireworks. Lock his ass up,” said Kwame Rose, a prominent activist during the Freddie Gray “Uprising” in 2015. Rose grabbed the protester by his shirt and dragged him to the police past the barricades at City Hall. The incident was recorded by Brew photographer J.M. Giordano. About 11:45 p.m., a battered pickup truck with signs promoting the City Council candidacy of Rodney Hudson turned up on Baltimore Street. Rose commandeered the loudspeaker in the truck and spoke to the crowd: “If you do not want to go to jail, go home. . . Go home! We proved our points,” he said. “We did what we came here to do tonight. Do not turn this into something it does not have to be. “I’ve been when you at five years ago. I’m telling you, tomorrow we come back and show again. Don’t give them what they’re looking for. Don’t give them another excuse. Let’s go. Let’s get home!” Some later praised his actions saying Rose had prevented an escalation that could have turned violent, while others were horrified to see a leader of the action handing someone over to the very police being denounced by the protesters. As the crowd melted away on Baltimore Street, Rose ran to another knot of protesters on South Street. When this group failed to disperse, police charged, pushing about 100 demonstrators up Guilford Avenue to Lexington Street. Under the shadow of Courthouse East, most of the protesters left. The handful that remained lingered without incident at the intersection until after 1 a.m., according to Giordano.",0.0

It's a primary election date that was already going to be a challenge for election officials due to health concerns, even before nationwide unrest led to curfew orders in conflict with polling place hours in some places. In Washington, D.C., as well as the eight states voting Tuesday, the vast majority of ballots are expected to be mailed in. In Montana, for instance, election officials mailed every active registered voter a ballot. But the in-person voting options that are also required to be offered in many places create a unique problem. In Philadelphia, for instance, officials are trying to reassure voters they won't be arrested for voting in the Pennsylvania primary if the city decides to extend a 6 p.m. curfew to Tuesday. Polling places will stay open in the city until 8 p.m. ""Philly residents will not be arrested or prosecuted for going to or coming from voting tomorrow,"" District Attorney Larry Krasner told NPR member station WHYY on Monday. ""No curfew is going to interfere with any voter going to the polls. Please do not let these circumstances dissuade you."" Similarly, the District of Columbia's Board of Elections announced that vote centers, which are scheduled to be open until 8 p.m., would not be affected by a 7 p.m. curfew order in the city. ""Voters at Vote Centers and election workers are permitted to be at Vote Centers at 7, and are allowed a reasonable amount of time to get home,"" the board tweeted Monday evening. Across the country, jurisdictions are also having to adjust their in-person voting options to reduce health risks and accommodate massive poll worker shortages. The District is maintaining 20 polling places as a result of the pandemic, as opposed to its usual 144, and Philadelphia is also offering about a fifth of its normal locations. In Rhode Island, election officials are providing voters with ""one-time use stylus/pen combination devices"" to check in on electronic machines, and vote on paper. The secretary of state's office issued a seven-page report detailing how precincts should be organized and cleaned. Beyond the logistical concerns, the next question is simply whether people will be motivated to vote despite the obstacles, especially now that the Democratic presidential primary is all but wrapped up. ""We really are in uncharted territory for voting in America,"" Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the Voting Rights Project with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said on a call with reporters Tuesday. ""We won't know the impact of the challenges we're facing until much later."" Her organization runs a hotline (866-OUR-VOTE) that voters can call with questions or issues, and she said they received almost 3,000 calls in the past week. On Tuesday, the organization has fielded calls about Indiana voters facing long lines in Indianapolis, Maryland voters who say they did not receive their absentee ballots on time, and Pennsylvania voters confused by precinct changes. Johnson-Blanco called it the ""first super Tuesday of the COVID era,"" and she said that any problems encountered could be clues to issues that should be expected to sprout up again in the general election in November.

Police Chief Lisa Myers and several other officers joined in a protest in the county Tuesday evening, calling for an end to police brutality in the wake of Floyd’s death. WJZ COMPLETE COVERAGE: George Floyd’s Death And Its Impacts In Maryland Myers told WJZ she feels the protesters’ hurt and their pain, adding the way Floyd’s arrest and subsequent death were unacceptable. “These types of incidents embarrass our profession,” she said. “And we want to show them that we support them and their legal ability to be out and to protest and to have a forum to have their voices heard.” Howard County Executive Calvin Ball also protested. He said, in part: “The youth-led demonstration today had many calls to action and we must all work together to create the change we seek. Now, it is more important than ever that residents have the opportunity for their voices to be heard, the freedom to peacefully protest and organize, and the ability to demand we do better as a community. As a county that prides itself on inclusion and civility, it remains our responsibility to collaborate, encourage and create an open dialogue to improve race-relations and institute changes that improve the quality of life for not only current, but future generations. Change will only come locally if we work to encourage our friends and neighbors to do the same.” Hundreds of demonstrators took part in the youth-led march one day after a similar protest in Baltimore. The officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck during the arrest, Derek Chauvin, has since been fired and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.

Led by Baltimore City youth, the first part of the rally kicked off at 4 p.m. with words from Kelly Davis, wife of Keith Davis Jr., poet Mecca Verdell, and other youth organizers. “Do not let this be a one day occurrence,” Davis said, looking into the sea of people gathered at the Baltimore Convention Center. “We are not outnumbered, we are out organized. We have the numbers. We have the power.” “If you are a politician…use your platform, stick your neck out, put your reputation on the line for your people.” The protest was nonviolent throughout the day and included performance art from the very youth who say they organized the demonstration with five text messages. The anger and emotion in their pieces was palpable. The youth highlighted the country’s love of Black culture- but not Black lives or the struggle that accompanies them, and decried the many injustices that have led to violence across the country. “Don’t be mad at the voices, be mad at the choices that were made,” said Mecca Verdell, reciting a poem for the crowd. “Don’t be scared when we stop writing about this, and start rioting about this.” Protestors took to the Jones Falls Expressway at one point and were met by a police car that slowly backed off the interstate after a brief conversation. Marchers left I-83 and passed the Baltimore City Correctional Center on Greenmount Avenue before looping back to City Hall. At one point, several officers kneeled in solidarity with the crowd, as taunts of “coward” met those who refused the gesture. Calls to oust racist, power-drunk police officers and their silent partners echoed through downtown Baltimore all afternoon and into the evening. “If it wasn’t for social media posts there really wouldn’t be a light on the kind of crooked [expletive] that police are out here doing to us,” said Melvin Townes, 21, who supported the demonstrations early in the day. Though youth demonstrators and their supporters were peaceful, police officers were met with much rowdier protesters after the sun went down and the youth dispersed. After an arrest around 10:30 pm, the atmosphere became increasingly uneasy. The men of Baltimore’s COR, led by Munir Bahar, tried to keep order along with other citizens concerned about police punishing peaceful protestors in response to the actions of unruly “outsiders.” After fireworks were thrown at officers, the White culprit was marched to police by Black protestors. Others who were deemed “outsiders” were physically pushed out of the crowd. Flashbangs caused the crowd to panic at several points, but they continued to return and face off with police well after midnight. Calls to “hold the line” could be heard over other protestors imploring people to go home after the third ignored warning to disperse. Though he wants to create a positive narrative for himself and everyone around him, when asked what he thought about the rioting taking place in response to Floyd’s killing, Townes said he understands. “Every time something happens to a Black man we protest and we protest,” he told the AFRO, standing in front of Baltimore’s City Hall. “When we start to uprise, we make them feel our pain. That’s the only way for them to understand us. The only way is to show them and come together.”",0.0

The incident, during which officers used stun guns on the pair and pulled them from their vehicle, received national attention after bystanders recorded and posted video to social media. ""I agree with Mayor [Keisha Lance] Bottoms and I agree with our police chief, Erika Shields, when they both have conveyed in so many separate ways that the conduct in this incident — it is not indicative of the way that we treat people in the city of Atlanta,"" Fulton County, Ga., District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters Tuesday. Howard's office has filed charges — mostly assorted aggravated assault and battery counts — against a half-dozen officers involved in the arrest: Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Streeter and Gardner have been fired from the force since Saturday's confrontation, while three others have been placed on desk duty. Howard said the charges are backed up by extensive interviews with the young couple, Taniyah Pilgrim and Messiah Young, as well as video evidence from bystanders and the officers' body camera footage. The district attorney played one such video from a bodycam. During the video, officers on foot confront Pilgrim and Young, who had been passing them in a car. After the two black occupants appear to drive away briefly from the officers, Pilgrim and Young stop — at which point the officers swarm the vehicle. Stun guns are used on both occupants, who are ripped from the car over Pilgrim's screams to stop. Pilgrim was never charged; Young was charged with attempting to elude officers before the charge was dismissed at the request of the mayor, who apologized. ""We just need to see that all officers are held accountable, and that there really is change moving forward within the culture of policing,"" Young said at a news conference. Atlanta and other cities have seen widespread protests over the past week after another video — that of George Floyd's arrest in Minneapolis — catalyzed outrage over violence in policing. Floyd died after Derek Chauvin — who has since been fired from the Minneapolis police and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter — dug a knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Video of the incident involving Pilgrim and Young caused a stir of its own. ""We understand our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" the Atlanta mayor said Sunday, describing the video as ""disturbing on many levels."" ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.""  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In dozens of cities yesterday, large, mostly peaceful demonstrations devolved into chaos. In Nashville, Miami, Seattle and Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, New York and, frankly, too many other places to name, protesters expressed their rage at the death of George Floyd, police brutality and racism. There were violent confrontations with police, and police cracked down, also violently. There were also mass arrests and injuries among demonstrators, journalists and police. At least a dozen major cities declared curfews. Others called on the National Guard, which has been historically used in response to major civil unrest. There were scenes of National Guard marching through some residential neighborhoods, ordering people to stay inside. We go now to Los Angeles, where members of the National Guard were also deployed overnight and a curfew was put in place as a state of emergency was declared. NPR's Nathan Rott is in LA, and he joins us now. Nate, walk us through what happened yesterday. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: So there was a massive peaceful protest that started around noon yesterday. It was in the Fairfax district in west L.A., which is kind of a trendy neighborhood with high-end retail and a big outdoor mall. And people were protesting against police violence, as they are all over the country. They were memorializing George Floyd, the black man who died after being pinned to the ground by Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, by all accounts, it was peaceful, respectful until a little later in the afternoon, when we started seeing reports of police cars being set on fire and just a total breakdown in the situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This often happens at protests, right? When things shift as things go into the night. Do we know what happened? ROTT: Yeah. And that - honestly, that was a little surprising, Lulu. Usually, these, like, shifts do happen at night. And this started in broad daylight in mid-afternoon, which is, I think, very concerning to a lot of the city officials. So, you know, on social media, people were blaming the police for escalating tensions, for responding with tear gas and the sort of militarized riot gear that has become so commonplace around the country. City officials have so far blamed bad eggs in the crowd for setting things off, and that's something we've been hearing in a lot of places - that it's a small group of people who are agitating these situations. Of course, that's now been politicized, even with the U.S. attorney general blaming anarchists and leftists without, you know, providing any proof of that. But it's really hard to say what makes this situations shift. Tensions are obviously very high, so it doesn't take much to spark something. GARCIA-NAVARRO: No, it doesn't. We saw videos of looting and fires in many cities around the country last night. That was also the case in LA, right? ROTT: Yeah. A number of retail stores in that Fairfax area were broken into. Goods were stolen. Some were set on fire. I know firefighters were dealing with those fires throughout the night. That prompted LA's mayor, Eric Garcetti, to announce a citywide curfew, which caught a lot of people off guard because he announced it an hour before it went into effect. But here he is explaining why they did it and alluding to violent protests in 1992 following Rodney King. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: We've seen this before in Los Angeles. When the violence escalates, no one wins. And so everybody has to be responsible for owning this moment. Whether you wear a badge or whether you hold a sign, I'm asking all of Los Angeles to take a deep breath and to step back for a moment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does it seem like the curfew worked briefly? ROTT: Yeah, the crowds started to thin out even before the curfew started. I know in other parts of the state - Sacramento, San Diego - there were large confrontations between crowds and police. I think, you know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Nate Rott in LA. Thank you so much. ROTT: Yeah. Thank you, Lulu.

House Democrats are sorting through dozens of proposals to address policing issues, including excessive use of force and racial profiling. ""It is time, it is time for us to address the concerns that were being expressed by the protesters,"" Pelosi said at a press event at the Capitol Tuesday. ""This is not a single incident. We know this is a pattern of behavior. and we also know the history that brings us to this sad place."" Democrats hope to calm the increasingly incendiary atmosphere in the country over Floyd's death by finding ways to address the underlying systemic problems enraging protesters in the streets. There is some degree of bipartisan support for reviewing the tactics that led to Floyd's death. Many Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have acknowledged what McConnell called ""egregious wrongs."" McConnell said Tuesday there could be a role for Congress to play here. ""It's certainly something that we need to take a look at,"" McConnell told reporters. ""We'll be talking to our colleagues about what, if anything, is appropriate for us to do in the wake of what's going on."" But the discussion has often become entwined with public outcry over President Trump's handling of the unrest and his threat to use military force to quell protests. Pelosi said Floyd's killing ""happened in broad daylight, it happened for all the world to see. A knee to the neck, not only by the perpetrator of that murder but by three officers observing it."" Congress has often struggled to address policing issues. Many decisions about policing tactics, training and strategies are determined at the state and local level. Pelosi is asking members of the Congressional Black Caucus to sort through the ideas and find legislation that can pass the House where Democrats have enough votes for approval without GOP support. Among the options is a 2015 bill introduced by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that would outlaw the use of chokeholds in policing. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has endorsed that idea. Democrats are hoping to reach an agreement quickly. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters he could call lawmakers back to Washington to vote before their scheduled return on June 30. Hoyer said that he has been in contact with the Congressional Black Caucus over the last four days and that it is considering more than 50 pieces of legislation, including a proposal to end qualified immunity for police officers, or their legal protection shield for certain actions. Democrats also plan to try to force the Senate to go on record condemning Trump for ""ordering federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against Americans who were peaceably protesting"" Monday outside the White House. The resolution, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would also affirm the rights of free assembly and protest while condemning looting. The measure is unlikely to pass as it requires unanimous consent to be approved. Republicans, including McConnell, have largely focused on calling for protests to remain peaceful without directly discussing the conflict at the White House. ""It is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace in our streets and peace in our communities,"" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""We need to unite against these violent rioters who seek only to aggrandize themselves and further damage a nation that needs healing."" Most Senate Republicans declined Tuesday to discuss the tear gas incident at the White House when reporters on Capitol Hill asked them about it. Some avoided the question; others said they didn't see the incident. Those who did speak to reporters mostly focused on condemning violent protests. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has announced a June 16 hearing on police use of force. ""We intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd's death, with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation,"" Graham said in a statement Friday. ",0.0

(Christopher Harris via AP, File) Warning: Social media embeds may contain profanity WASHINGTON (AP) — Undeterred by curfews, protesters streamed back into the nation’s streets Tuesday, hours after President Donald Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by George Floyd’s death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As more demonstrations began taking shape around the country, and cities including Washington prepared for the possibility of more violence, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. We’re done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. 10:35 p.m. (ET) Beloved former St. Louis police captain killed by looters  For 38 years, Dave Dorn worked to protect and serve the public as a police officer, rising to the rank of captain in the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. Dorn was shot and killed by a looter overnight while working as a security guard at Lee’s Pawn and Jewelry on Martin Luther King Drive, KTVI reports. He was 77. “He was exercising his law enforcement training,” said St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden. “So, in his honor, we are wearing our mourning badge.” After retiring from the St. Louis department in 2007, Dorn became the chief of police in Moline Acres. No matter where Dave Dorn worked, people loved him. Retired St. Louis police Officer David Ellison said Dorn helped him out of poverty and into a life in law enforcement. “Dave Dorn was a great man. He was fair; the sharpest, cleanest guy,” Ellison said. “He came out of the car; his presence was well-known and observed. He meant business when it was time for business.” Chief Hayden said investigators have made no arrests and have not identified a suspect. 10:19 p.m. (ET) New York City HAPPENING NOW: Stand off.

Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. the night before, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard. After some people broke into a Zara on Broadway lots of police arrived, by car, bike, on foot. pic.twitter.com/B2UWZ5hLfR — Jan Ransom (@Jan_Ransom) June 3, 2020 “Everyone, time to go home so we can keep people safe,” he said on WINS-AM radio shortly after the curfew took effect. He was ignored by many around the city who continued marching throughout the city’s streets. In some areas, police let people continue on their way, while making arrests in others. “I’m surprised,” said Risha Munoz, on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where at points they were greeted with cheers and horns by onlookers in building windows. “I didn’t think they were gonna let us go on, but we just kept on moving and we’re not stopping.” In some locations, officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them. “Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change. We hear Cuomo and de Blasio everyday saying what’s happening is unacceptable but with no actionable plan from them.” The police department announced it would not allow vehicle traffic south of 96th Street in Manhattan after curfew, though residents, essential workers, buses and truck deliveries were exempt. “We’re going to have a tough few days. We’re going to beat it back,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said in announcing that the 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew would remain through Sunday. Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. While de Blasio insisted the city would put a stop to the violence and vandalism that have marred largely peaceful mass demonstrations surrounding Floyd’s death, both the Republican president and the Democratic governor laid into the city’s handling of the mayhem thus far. “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. “Look at the videos. It was a disgrace.” He said the mayor was underestimating the problem and the nation’s largest police force wasn’t deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Cuomo’s remarks infuriated the New York Police Department’s highest-ranking uniformed member, Chief of Department Terence Monahan. Officers are “giving their blood to keep this city safe,” he told the New York Post, adding that he’d been hit by a bike and bloodied himself while arresting suspects Monday night. Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi later said the governor “has respect and confidence in the NYPD” and felt the mayor should put more officers on the streets. Unprompted, Cuomo brought up the possibility of using his power as governor to replace the mayor and deploy the National Guard over de Blasio’s objections, then immediately shot down the idea as legally impractical and unnecessary. On Twitter, Trump urged a 7 p.m. curfew and National Guard deployment in his native city. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” he wrote. But de Blasio said the NYPD was “best equipped” to handle the lawbreaking, arguing that bringing in the National Guard risked fueling worse conflict in a city on edge. “We will regret it if we bring outside armed forces,” he said. “When you bring in people not trained for the circumstance but still with loaded weapons and put under horrible stress, really bad things happen.” The mayhem over the last four nights has clearly challenged the 36,000-officer police force, which has a reputation as a muscular, well-resourced agency that has driven down crime and faced down terror threats in the nation’s biggest city. On Monday night and early Tuesday, police again struggled to keep up with, let alone get ahead of, roving groups of people bashing their way into shops, including Macy’s flagship Manhattan store. De Blasio said officials expected problems farther downtown, as had happened the night before, and “adjustments were made” once officials realized that the hot spots had shifted. Nearly 700 people were arrested overnight, and several officers were injured. A sergeant was struck by a hit-and-run driver in the Bronx and was hospitalized in serious but stable condition, police said. Video also showed a group of people hitting a police officer with pieces of wreckage until he pulled his gun and they ran. 7:06 p.m. (ET) Officers taking a knee with protesters in Los Angeles Watch all of this. pic.twitter.com/YHq0QhXrnw — Gadi Schwartz (@GadiNBC) June 2, 2020 Sarasota, Fla.

FILE – This undated file photo provided by Christopher Harris shows George Floyd. Floyd died May 25, after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. (Christopher Harris via AP, File) Gov. Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights announced the filing of the formal complaint at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. The governor and Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said they hope to reach agreement with the city to identify short-term ways to address the police department’s history of racial discrimination, and use the investigation to find long-term solutions for systemic change. Lucero said their goal is to negotiate a consent decree with the city that courts could enforce with injunctions and financial penalties. There are precedents, she said, including a consent decree approved in Chicago last year after the U.S. Justice Department found a long history of racial bias and excessive use of force by police. Widely seen bystander video showing Floyd’s death has sparked sometimes violent protests around the world. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers involved were fired but have not been charged. “We know that deeply seated issues exist,” the governor said. “And the reason I know it is we saw the casual nature of the erasing of George Floyd’s life and humanity. We also know by the reaction of the community. They expected nothing to happen, and the reason is because nothing did happen for so many times.” Walz said the investigation into the police department’s policies, procedures and practices over the past 10 years will determine if the force has engaged in systemic discrimination toward people of color, and root it out. Lucero will lead the investigation. All 12 members of the Minneapolis City Council endorsed a statement read by Council President Lisa Bender at a news conference later Tuesday in support of the investigation. “We urge the state to use its full weight to hold the Minneapolis Police Department accountable for any and all abuses of power and harms to our community and stand ready to aid in this process as full partners,” the council said. Mayor Jacob Frey said the state’s intervention will help break what he called a stalemate on reform. “For years in Minneapolis, police chiefs and elected officials committed to change have been thwarted by police union protections and laws that severely limit accountability among police departments,” Frey said in a statement. “I welcome today’s announcement because breaking through those persistent barriers, shifting the culture of policing, and addressing systemic racism will require all of us working hand in hand.” A police department spokesman and the president of the officers’ union didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The FBI is also investigating whether police willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights enforces the state’s human rights act, particularly as it applies to discrimination in employment, housing, education, public accommodations and public services. Mediation is one of its first-choice tools, but the cases it files can lead to fuller investigations and sometimes end up in litigation. The Minneapolis Police Department has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African Americans and other minorities, even within the department itself. Critics say its culture resists change, despite the elevation of Medaria Arradondo as its first black police chief in 2017. Arradondo himself was among five black officers who sued the police department in 2007 over alleged discrimination in promotions, pay, and discipline. They said in their lawsuit that the department had a history of tolerating racism and discrimination. The city settled the lawsuit for $740,000. State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, who was neighboring St. Paul’s second black police chief, said good officers should welcome the investigation. He co-chaired a working group with Attorney General Keith Ellison that reported back in February on ways to reduce police-involved deadly force encounters. “I’ve been a cop for 40 years. I have lived in this system that they’re talking about reforming. … The cops I talk to, the cops I’ve worked with since 1977 to date will tell you, they want change,” Harrington said. “They don’t want to work in a flawed system. They don’t want to have to be wearing gas masks. They don’t want to have to be on riot control duty.” Earlier Tuesday, an attorney for Floyd’s family again decried the official autopsy that found his death was caused by cardiac arrest as police restrained him and compressed his neck. The medical examiner also listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use, but not as the cause of death. A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression. “The cause of death was that he was starving for air. It was lack of oxygen. And so everything else is a red herring to try to throw us off,” family attorney Ben Crump said. He said the Hennepin County medical examiner went to great lengths to try to convince the public that what was shown on bystander video didn’t cause Floyd to die. Ellison told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine whether more charges will be filed. 5:28 p.m. (ET) 14th St. in Washington, D.C. 5:13 p.m. (ET) Curfews give sweeping powers to cops, but are often flouted Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional. From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place — in some cases for the first time in decades — sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets. But the deadlines aren’t hard and fast — many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on violent unrest. A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. And curfews can be a deterrent to get law-abiding citizens off the street and allow police to focus their efforts on the unrest and not get bogged down in run-of-the-mill violations. New York City put in place a large-scale curfew for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years this week as groups vandalized buildings and stole from stores. The curfew was originally 11 p.m., but Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled it back to 8 p.m., before the sun goes down. “If you choose to protest today, do it in the daytime hours and then please go home because we have work to do to keep a peaceful city,” de Blasio said. Curfews have been installed in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit, Denver. Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities and communities across the country. Curfews aren’t unusual in the United States but are typically used in natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to allow law enforcement to stop anyone on the streets and prevent stealing when many homes and empty or damaged. New York City has used curfews in specific locations like parks — sometimes with controversial results. The 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot in Manhattan had to do in part with a then-newly imposed 1 a.m. parks department curfew in a bid to rid the park of drugs and crime. In enforcing the curfew, police flooded the park with officers and were accused of rampant abuses. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani ramped up enforcement of Central Park’s nightly closure after a string of robberies in the late 1990s. Giuliani was so strict about the curfew, he wouldn’t grant an exception for a late-night vigil to John Lennon, despite intercession from the lord mayor of Liverpool on behalf of aggrieved Beatles fans. During the unrest of the past week, police also want bystanders off the street during unrest — and the curfew solves that. “The curfew really is to keep people from coming sort of to gawk at what’s going on and keep the looky-loos away,” said Sacramento City Councilman Steve Hansen, whose city’s 8 p.m. Monday curfew appeared to help prevent the destructive demonstrations from the night before. The curfews also come on the heels of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, making for an unprecedented stretch in cities like New York. In Columbia, South Carolina, officials lifted a weekend curfew and the mayor joined an afternoon protest at the state capitol calling for police reform. But several dozen people stayed for hours after the protest ended as tensions with police grew as shadows got longer. Just before 7:30 p.m. Monday, Columbia, South Carolina , Mayor Steve Benjamin set a curfew for 7:45 p.m. for a small area of downtown and an areas of restaurants and shops. The city sent an emergency notice and protesters looked at their screens as their phones started to buzz and the curfew set in. The protesters immediately started to walk away. But some civil rights organizations think hastily issued curfews are unfair and against the First Amendment of the Constitution. “By making presence on public streets anywhere in these cities unlawful, these measures give police too much discretion over whom to arrest,” said the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California after a number of cities issued curfews. New York City on Monday found out an unintended consequence of a curfew is keeping away law-abiding protesters. The night before, they banded together to stop vandalism and help police find lawbreakers. It also sends a subtle message, said New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez. “Implementing a curfew and increasing the number of police officers patrolling the streets is a tactic to effectively silence the voices raised in protest against the abuse of power and looting of black and colored bodies by members of the police,” Rodriguez said. Curfews can cause other problems too. Charleston, South Carolina, had a curfew for three days after late night Saturday protests led to shattered windows for restaurants and businesses and stolen merchandise downtown. Monday night was quiet. And Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said he immediately heard from a certain group of people. “We want to give our businesses a chance to get back into business,” Tecklenburg told his City Council at a Tuesday meeting lifting the curfew. A curfew also allows police to separate people who want to protest while following the law from people who want to cause harm, said Tamara Herold, an assistant professor in the Criminal Justice Department at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. That makes it easier for law enforcement to decide how to use force to break up unrest. “One of the things police always want to avoid is using indiscriminate force against a large crowd,” Herold said. 5:04 p.m. (ET) George W. Bush issues statement on ‘brutal suffocation’ of George Floyd: ‘It is time for us to listen’ Former President George W. Bush issued a statement Tuesday regarding the “brutal suffocation of George Floyd,” saying it is “time for us to listen” and that it is time for America to “examine our tragic failures.” The full statement is below: “Laura and I are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country. Yet we have resisted the urge to speak out, because this is not the time for us to lecture. It is time for us to listen. It is time for America to examine our tragic failures – and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths. It remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country. It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future. This tragedy — in a long series of similar tragedies — raises a long overdue question: How do we end systemic racism in our society? The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving. Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place. America’s greatest challenge has long been to unite people of very different backgrounds into a single nation of justice and opportunity. The doctrine and habits of racial superiority, which once nearly split our country, still threaten our Union. The answers to American problems are found by living up to American ideals — to the fundamental truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by God with certain rights. We have often underestimated how radical that quest really is, and how our cherished principles challenge systems of intended or assumed injustice. The heroes of America — from Frederick Douglass, to Harriet Tubman, to Abraham Lincoln, to Martin Luther King, Jr. — are heroes of unity. Their calling has never been for the fainthearted. They often revealed the nation’s disturbing bigotry and exploitation — stains on our character sometimes difficult for the American majority to examine. We can only see the reality of America’s need by seeing it through the eyes of the threatened, oppressed, and disenfranchised. That is exactly where we now stand. Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions. We know that lasting justice will only come by peaceful means. Looting is not liberation, and destruction is not progress. But we also know that lasting peace in our communities requires truly equal justice. The rule of law ultimately depends on the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system. And achieving justice for all is the duty of all. This will require a consistent, courageous, and creative effort. We serve our neighbors best when we try to understand their experience. We love our neighbors as ourselves when we treat them as equals, in both protection and compassion. There is a better way — the way of empathy, and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice. I am confident that together, Americans will choose the better way.” 4:43 p.m. (ET) Barr vows ‘even greater’ law enforcement resources in unrest U.S. law enforcement officials vowed “even greater law enforcement resources and support” in the nation’s capital Tuesday night to respond to protests, as one local county pulled its officers out, saying they were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said she never requested help from neighboring jurisdictions to quell demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. She said D.C. officials flatly rejected a proposal floated by the Trump administration to take over the local police department and threatened legal action if they did. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city. “There will be even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region tonight,” Barr said in a statement. “The most basic function of government is to provide security for people to live their lives and exercise their rights, and we will meet that responsibility here in the nation’s capital.” Law enforcement officers, using flash bangs and tear gas, took aggressive action Monday night to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Donald Trump’s walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, which included officers on foot and horseback, Arlington County in Virginia pulled its officers out of the District of Columbia. The County Board issued a statement Monday night saying its officers were used “for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations.” County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she’s “appalled” that the mutual aid agreement was abused “for a photo op.” In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have provided aid to each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in the District on Saturday and Sunday without incident. In a call with governors Monday, Trump and Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The call raised questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Trump said he was “taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America.” The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.” A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. After speaking in the Rose Garden, Trump then walked slowly out of the White House gates, senior aides and security with him, across the park to the landmark St. John’s Church, where every president, including Trump, has prayed. It had been damaged Sunday night in a protest fire. Trump then stood alone in front of cameras and raised a Bible — and declared, “We have a great country,” he said. “Greatest country in the world.” Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation’s capital, a senior Justice Department official said. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies “confronting the lawless actions of rioters,” the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and in D.C. , Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other “anarchists.” Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the “violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups” as domestic terrorism. Although there isn’t a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. In addition to the National Guard, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0

""Violence has no place and violence must be addressed,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told NPR's All Things Considered. ""But there is no reason for the U.S. military to be called out for this."" Pelosi was referring to a threat Trump made Monday evening in the Rose Garden at the White House. ""If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents,"" Trump declared in a brief statement, ""then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" As the president spoke, federal officers in riot gear near the White House launched tear gas and pepper spray at peaceful protesters. Shortly thereafter, Trump strode through a park cleared of the demonstrators to pose with a Bible in front of St. John's Church, leading a group of officials that included Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Walking like lapdogs behind a five-time draft dodging coward who is more interested in looking like a leader than actually being one,"" Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who lost both legs in combat as a military helicopter pilot in Iraq, said of Esper and Milley, ""sends a horrifying message to our troops — including our black and brown troops — that our military's leaders will not protect them from unlawful orders."" In a statement on Twitter, Duckworth added, ""We cannot allow any Commander in Chief to put our Armed Forces' reputation as the last institution Americans can trust and respect at risk by using them unlawfully and putting them in a position of exacerbating the divisions driving our union apart. ... Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not Presidential, it's tin-pot dictatorial."" But Trump does appear to have the power unilaterally to dispatch active-duty soldiers to trouble spots in the United States. The 1807 Insurrection Act authorizes a U.S. president to deploy military forces for domestic emergencies. The law was updated in 2006 to include natural disasters and terrorist attacks as grounds for sending federal troops to restore order. While condemning looting and vandalism that rocked Providence, R.I., on Monday evening, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, called Trump's threats to use military force against American citizens ""irresponsible and destablizing."" ""The job of bringing calm will take law enforcement and the community working together,"" Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. ""It will not come from recklessly invoking the Insurrection Act."" The Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee told reporters Tuesday he plans to convene an in-person congressional hearing next week to press the Pentagon's top two officials on Trump's possible invocation of the Insurrection Act. ""We need to hear from Chairman Milley and Secretary Esper as to exactly how they intend to use the U.S. military trying to deal with this domestic crisis,"" U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said on a video conference call. ""If the president is basically threatening to use the U.S. military to go in and enforce the law in U.S. cities, that runs the risk of an extreme escalation in violence and of a hugely disruptive practice."" Asked about Milley wearing camouflage fatigues in public Monday night, Smith said the nation's highest military officer may have misread the message being sent. ""The optics of him being in uniform out there might not have been so bad if we didn't have the president out there talking about going to war with the country and using the military and using overwhelming force,"" Smith said of Milley. In a conference call Monday, Trump told the nation's governors that Milley was ""a fighter, a war hero, a lot of victories and no losses and he hates to see the way it's being handled in the various states, and I just put him in charge."" Milley, whom Trump said was on the call, said nothing.

According to a flyer distributed on social media earlier in the week, the groups planned to gather on the sidewalk of Route One near the Exxon station at 4 p.m. on June 5. The vigil was described as peaceful, and people were told to bring appropriate signs to carry and show to passing cars, all to ""unite against rate, racism, and police brutality."" On Tuesday evening however, both WMS-DE and the SDARJ announced on social media their withdrawal of sponsorship. Both wrote that the decision to pull out came after news and feedback of organized disruption of peaceful demonstrations. ""We do not want to give space and place to an organized group meant to disrupt and turn the focus from why people are rallying to how people are rioting,"" both groups wrote. The two groups said they are working with the League of Women Voters to host a virtual town hall also titled ""Enough is Enough."" SDARJ says the town hall will take place June 19 ""to begin a serious dialogue on police brutality and the dangers facing African Americans and others of color in America. SDARJ is committed to seeking and demanding solutions now."" It's unclear at this time if the vigil will take place without the two groups' involvement. A peaceful protest took place in Rehoboth Beach on Monday night. Both demonstrations were organized to protest the death of Minneapolis man George Floyd, who died in police custody.

Photo by Briana Adhikusuma Hundreds of protesters marched through downtown Bethesda on Tuesday afternoon, shouting, “Black Lives Matter!” and “I can’t breathe!” and waving signs. Bystanders held up their phones and took photos and videos of the crowd. It was the third straight day in Montgomery County of protests over the death of George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who was pinned to the ground by a police officer on May 25. Floyd, who was black, was in handcuffs and told Chauvin that he couldn’t breathe. During Tuesday’s protest in Bethesda, Montgomery County police officers blocked traffic with their cars and rode alongside the procession on bikes. The march lasted for several hours and weaved its way throughout the downtown area. Earlier, the protesters held a rally at the Connie Morella Library in Bethesda, where several people spoke to a crowd of more than 1,000 people about their experiences with racism or their feelings about injustice in the country. Protestors sat in the parking lot of the library and poured out into the streets as they cheered and chanted together. “Your silence is violence.” “This is what democracy looks like.” “No more murder.” Mareike Nebel, an 18-year-old recent graduate of Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, spoke to the crowd, along with several other local high schoolers who organized the protest. Her voice quivered as she held a microphone and said she shouldn’t have to follow in the footsteps of her grandmother, who participated in the March on Washington. “It makes me cry that all of the hard work that my grandfather and my grandmother did hasn’t made a difference,” she said. Tatiana Johnson, a 17-year-old student at Walt Whitman High School, said people across the country have started to notice the need and impact of the protests. “[A protest] like this doesn’t happen here,” Johnson said, gesturing to the crowd of protesters behind her. Nebel said people are starting to pay more attention to racism in their communities because they’re exhausted from seeing police brutality and black people being killed. The Rev. Dee Ledger of Bethesda United Church of Christ attended the protest with her 7-year-old twin sons. She said she’s had conversations with her sons to help them understand what is going on with racism in the community. “I grew up in an area that was racist,” she said. “I want them to grow up in a world that honors all bodies. … It’s painful to see our society ripped apart.” A group of friends, including Nebel and Johnson, organized the protest and started to circulate details about it on Instagram. As people began to share the event, more took notice, resulting in the hundreds who showed up on Tuesday afternoon. Joe Zengerle, a Bethesda resident and Army veteran, spoke during the protest as well. “I’m an old white guy. I’m around 78 years old and I just had back surgery,” he said, adding that he was advised to stay away from crowds because of concerns about COVID-19. “I wouldn’t miss this.” Zengerle said love needed to be the answer to racism and would “win the day.” “Think about the love you have for each other right now,” he told the crowd. “Keep the love that you have for each other here today.” Richard Deabreu, 31, of Silver Spring, said that bringing a large group of people together who are equally outraged by racism seemed to be the only way to get attention. Deabreu said he came to show his support. “I want [others] to see me,” he said. “I think people are getting fed up. Everyone is tired of seeing [the violence]. When are you going to stop it?” About 30 police officers were at the protest and another 30 to 40 were ready to respond if needed, according to Montgomery County police Capt. Sean Gagen, commander of the Second District station in Bethesda. Shortly after the march ended, another group of hundreds of protestors lined Wisconsin Avenue and then marched along the sidewalks in Woodmont Triangle. Many of those protestors were from the East Bethesda neighborhood, east of Wisconsin Avenue. Other Montgomery County protests or vigils over Floyd’s death have been held in Germantown, Gaithersburg and Chevy Chase, and others are expected this week.

We will not support a platform that incites violence, racism and lives hashtag black lives matter. Frank told CNBC the companies were in final negotiations on a six figure content partnership is at his company would have netted hundreds of thousands of dollars in the deal, which would have provided free therapy to some users. But Frank said he'd be willing to reopen discussions if Facebook improved its methods for moderating content. In the wake of the protests surrounding George Floyd's death, Trump shared a post saying. When the looting starts, the shooting starts. Twitter added labels saying it violated Twitter's rules about glorifying violence and move. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg openly disagreed with telling Fox News. I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbitrator of truth of everything that people say online. On Monday, there was a virtual walk out among Facebook employees who felt Trump's post violated their platform standards Advertisement Tensions rise among Facebook staff as Mark Zuckerberg gives explanation for inaction on President Trump posts Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: Facebook loses deal over its reaction to trump ‘looting’ post, employees stage virtual walkoutFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought Tuesday to ease employee outrage over his inaction on incendiary remarks recently posted by President Donald Trump.During a company-wide town hall, Zuckerberg struggled to explain his decision-making process as many of his employees, using a real-time feedback tool, reminded him of promises to remove content that calls for violence or that could lead to imminent physical harm.""It's crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us,"" Brandon Dail, an engineer at Facebook, tweeted as the town hall was taking place.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN Business that open and honest discussion ""has always been a part of Facebook's culture.""""Mark had an open discussion with employees today, as he has regularly over the years,"" Stone said. ""He's grateful for their feedback.""The meeting has threatened to ratchet up tensions at Facebook, which has been hit with allegations of right-wing bias from conservatives and criticized by others for tacitly condoning the spread of hate and racism.Another Facebook employee told CNN Business they found Zuckerberg's answers to staff questions at the town hall lacking, and said the CEO risked alienating more of his staff rather than addressing their concerns.During the event, Facebook staff shared links to a video of an exchange between Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zuckerberg last October when he said: ""If anyone, including a politician, is saying things that can cause, that is calling for violence or could risk imminent physical harm ... we will take that content down.""At one point, roughly 22,000 people had tuned into the live video feed, according to another Facebook worker who was watching the stream. The figure reflects nearly half of the company's 48,000 employees.The top question for Zuckerberg, which called for changes to the company's stance on political speech, received more than 5,400 votes from workers, the employee said.Not all employees disagree with Zuckerberg's position, however. One told CNN Business, ""Supporting free speech - especially when you vehemently disagree with what the person is saying - is a hard but important stance needed to make sure everyone can have a voice.""The employee said it is hard to be sure what portion of Facebook's staff supports Zuckerberg's decision. At least a few people with whom they have spoken do support it but are nervous to say so more publicly because they have seen the pushback within the company, the employee said.Tuesday's event follows days of employee activism over Facebook's handling of Trump's content.Some staffers staged a virtual walkout on Monday to protest decisions made by the company's leaders concerning posts by Trump. And at least one worker, software engineer Timothy Aveni, has quit his job, saying it is no longer feasible to ""keep excusing Facebook's behavior.""Facebook's workforce is known for keeping its disputes with executives largely private. But that changed on Friday, when Zuckerberg announced he would not act against content by Trump that Twitter had flagged earlier as having violated its own rules. The decision has prompted widespread criticism within Facebook that has spilled into public, with numerous employees expressing their disagreement on Twitter.One of Trump's posts had claimed, in reference to the demonstrations in Minneapolis, that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — a phrase with racist origins. Trump later professed not to know the history of the phrase, but he allowed the original remark to stand on Facebook and Twitter.Zuckerberg said the content provoked in him a ""visceral negative reaction."" But he justified his decision not to act against the posts, citing his responsibility as the ""leader of an institution committed to free expression.""In the eyes of his harshest internal critics, Zuckerberg had simply caved on prior principled commitments.""Mark can patch this one section of Facebook's policies, but if he derives his principle from the particular actions he wants to take, instead of taking action based on principle, it'll be fruitless in the long run,"" Aveni said in response to a CNN reporter's question on his post.",0.0

(WDVM) — Maryland Governor Larry Hogan has been in the national spotlight the past few months for his leadership role during the COVID-19 crisis. Hogan is a chairman of the National Governors’ Association. When his legislature packed up early because of the coronavirus, Hogan took command of pandemic public policy with business shutdowns and a jobless benefits system in disarray. Now he is hoping Maryland won’t have a repeat of the Freddie Gray riots, with the backdrop of last week’s killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. Meanwhile, the Maryland education community, beset with challenges during the public health crisis, is waiting patiently on the sidelines to reopen schools this fall. But it is anxious about the future because of Hogan’s veto of a landmark education bill right after legislators went home. “We put funding in jeopardy,” says Washington County Teachers’ Association president Neil Becker. “When the governor vetoed the [education] blueprint — which passed the General Assembly — he basically indicated through that veto that funding for education isn’t a priority in Maryland.” At $4 billion, it came with a hefty price tag. And now the state faces a $2 billion to $3 billion defict as a result of the pandemic. But special education advocates say they will be especially hard hit. Angie Auldridge is a Washington County special education advocate and says special ed has been historically underfunded. “That’s at the federal, the state and the local level, special education suffers the brunt of that shortage. Our students with disabilities require much greater support from teachers, from paraprofessionals, psychologists, social workers and service providers,” she says. Teachers Association president Becker says the blueprint already had provisions in it to pump the breaks if state revenues did not meet their target, making the veto unnecessary. And Auldridge says the funding is critical to meet federal education mandates. MORE NEWS ON WDVM",0.0

The Maryland city is no stranger to racial tensions, having experienced civil unrest after the 2015 police custody death of Freddie Gray. But demonstrations for George Floyd over the past four days have been largely peaceful, with no curfews issued and Monday’s youth-led march drawing more than 1,000 participants on the eve of Baltimore’s consequential mayoral primary election. Maryland’s Republican Gov. Larry Hogan tweeted Tuesday, “I’m proud that Baltimore is showing the nation how we can begin to build a more perfect union.” “We had thousands of people out expressing their very legitimate and real frustrations and anger but peacefully, working together in cooperation,” he told a local radio station. Baltimore Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young said at a press conference his city “leads the nation in setting the example of how to conduct peaceful protests.” Hundreds gathered around 3pm for a caravan demonstration, with cars and pedestrians marching to Baltimore's city hall.  There were tense moments after nightfall & 14 were arrested for unlawful behavior, but overall #GeorgeFloyd protests remained under control in the city. (6/6) pic.twitter.com/m99YwBqAmf — Julia Jester (@JulesJester) May 31, 2020 Even as protests grew tense Monday night after an “agitator” set off fireworks at officers and Maryland State Police activated reinforcements, both the police and the protesters avoided any violent escalation. Kwame Rose, an activist, was arrested during the Gray protests five years ago. His charges were dismissed, but his firsthand experience made him prioritize getting all the protesters home safely so that no one would have to be in jail -- especially during the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the nation. “Go home! We proved our point, we did what we came here to do tonight,” he told the remaining crowd late Monday after the police gave a second warning for them to disperse. “Do not turn this into something it does not have to be. I’ve been where you’re at five years ago … do not give them what they’re looking for.” Rose, 26, helped turn over a man lighting fireworks to the authorities, saying he felt compelled to protect the integrity of the protests and avoid chaos like that being seen in other cities. “When I see it, I understand it,” he said. “But I know what I want in my city. We’re going to do things in a way that brings about change in the most strategic way because we've been through this before.” Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha This is not to say there hasn’t been unlawful behavior -- Monday night’s protest resulted in six arrests, while Saturday night’s led to 14 arrests, eight reports of destruction of property and 11 burglaries. But these incidents pale in comparison to those in other major U.S. cities, 40 of which are under curfew. Hogan, who began his tenure a few months before the Gray riots, offered advice to leaders in other states: “peace through strength.” “Having the ability to keep the residents safe without becoming aggressive and without interfering with the peaceful, lawful protests,” Hogan told WBAL radio. “I think the community was much more involved and they didn't want to see it happen again -- and city police were much stronger and much more prepared.” Demonstrators face off with Baltimore Police as a CVS pharmacy burns at the corner of Pennsylvania and North avenues during violent protests following the funeral of Freddie Gray on April 27, 2015 in Baltimore, Md. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images file Gray, 25, died from a spinal injury suffered in a police van following an arrest. His death was later deemed a homicide. Six officers were charged in connection with his death, but they all later returned to the force after they were acquitted or their charges were dropped. Gray’s death sparked days of protests that resembled moments from the current unrest: officers in riot gear, protesters marching, police vehicles and businesses set ablaze, curfew orders issued, tensions spilling over. The Gray protests led to the Department of Justice and Baltimore agreeing on a consent decree to implement reforms in the city’s police department, including de-escalation training and enhanced transparency. But as flashbacks of Gray echo throughout the latest wave of protests, so does the unfinished work. “It's not about one city getting a handle on it because there were millions of dollars pumped into this city after the Baltimore uprising, but the community where Freddie Gray grew up still looks the same,” said Dr. Kaye Wise Whitehead, associate producer of African American Studies at Loyola University Maryland. “The issues they were having prior to the Baltimore uprising, with boarded-up housing, with the unemployment, those issues haven't changed.” City Councilwoman Shannon Sneed said Baltimore remains in a fragile state. “We still have a lot of incidents that have happened in Baltimore City since,” Sneed said, citing a local gag order bill she presented. “It just proves again that we have a lot of ground to cover.” While Rose says the department has “a long way to go” before making community policing a reality, he noticed that when protesters arrived at City Hall after the youth march, police were not yet wearing riot gear. The Youth, which organized Monday’s demonstration safely marching through I-83, released a statement Tuesday evening distancing its message from the actions of evening protesters and pushing back against Hogan’s comments. “We understand that the police establishment as a whole is too corrupt for reform, therefore we are calling for a complete restructuring of the system,” it reads in part. “We will continue to fight, until it is clear we no longer have to.” Whitehead, a mother of two sons, says the main difference five years later is facing a battle on dual fronts. “I've called it #BlackLivesMatter meets #BlackCOVIDStories,” she said. “Because even in the midst of trying to reconcile ourselves with the fact that so many people from our community have died from COVID-19, we also are back into the reality of what it means to deal with predatory police officers and would-be vigilantes who see black lives as something that can be disposed of, something that's not worth saving.” Rose thinks the peaceful nature of the demonstrations in the city is a testament to the respect that community leaders and activists have earned from its residents. “We won’t let outside agitators tell the story of Baltimore,” he said. “Baltimore is a city of resilience. Our main objective was to show the rest of the country that Baltimore is the place where we will be calm, we will display our anger and outrage in a productive and strategic manner, and also practice proper social distancing and protective etiquette during this COVID-19 pandemic.”",0.0

No matter where Dave Doran worked, people loved him. Retired ST Louis City Police Officer David Ellison says Dorn helped him out of poverty and into a life as a police officer. Dave Doran was a great man. He was fair there, sharpest, cleanest. We came out of the car. His presence was well known and observed, and he meant business when it was time to take care of business. The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in ST Louis, says Dorn was the type of brother that would have given his life to save them if he had. Too many of us younger officers looked up to him. He retired probably in 2004 so very well, like not very pleasant, and his wife still works here and a very sad time for our agency.

No arrests have been made.The shooting and theft apparently was posted on Facebook Live, but the video has since been taken down. It came on a violent night in St. Louis, where four officers were shot, officers were pelted with rocks and fireworks and 55 businesses were burglarized or damaged, including a convenience store that burned. Police also shot and gravely injured a burglary suspect who they say shot at officers.Cities across the U.S. have seen protests and violence since George Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleaded for air.Dorn, who was black, was a friend of the pawn shop’s owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, his wife, St. Louis police Sgt. Ann Marie Dorn, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.David Dorn served 38 years on the St. Louis police force before retiring in October 2007. He then became chief of Moline Acres, a small town in St. Louis County.Former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch knew Dorn for 30 years and said they became close friends when Dorn and his wife were leading the St. Louis police department's Explorers program for young people interested in law enforcement careers, while Fitch was leading the county's program.“He was very dedicated to youth, especially disadvantaged youth,"" said Fitch, who led the St. Louis County Police Department from 2009 to 2014. “He wanted to see them succeed. He wanted to be a role model for those young men and women to go into law enforcement.”Dorn' s personality was “bigger than life,” Fitch said. ""He was a fun guy, a happy guy. You never had to wonder what he was thinking when somebody did something incredibly stupid like a crime because he would just say it as he saw it.”When he took over as chief in Moline Acres, Dorn made it clear that his officers would be held to the strictest of standards, Fitch said.“He wanted them to do the right thing all the time,"" Fitch said.The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in St. Louis, said in a news release that Dorn was “the type of brother that would’ve given his life to save them if he had to.”St. Louis police Chief John Hayden called Dorn a ""fine captain.”“Many of us, the other officers, looked up to him,” Hayden said.

They may face adversity and racism one day from a source that is completely out of their control. Until my babies have their voice, I’m their voice right now,” said protester Shannon. The protest was organized through Facebook, and people who showed up say they wanted to make their voices heard and set examples for generations to come. “We’re standing here for equality. It’s too much injustice, and we really need to come together and actually make a point, and let us know that we’re all family. It doesn’t matter about the race. We just need to know that hey, wrong is wrong and right is right,” said protester Tanisha. Protesters tell 47ABC that gathering at Walmart and moving to Route 13 was the perfect place because of all the stores and restaurants that draw people to that area. “There’s Buffalo Wild Wings, Chick Fil A and everything. Main places that people eat, and come through. Plus Delmar is right there. So you have to come through here if you want to stop. So why not be right here?” said Tanisha.

Protesters marched through the streets of Dover and rallied outside locations like the Kent County Courthouse throughout Tuesday afternoon, eventually going to State Police Troop #1 during the evening hours. A crowd of people twice blocked U.S. Route 13 to draw attention to issues involving race and equality. David Haye, one of the organizers of the demonstration, said it was important to get the group's message across to Delawareans but also to be peaceful and avoid violence and unrest seen in other parts of the country over Floyd's death.

The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the months long state-by-state primary season.Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March.Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground.Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations.“Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said.Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.”Related video: Joe Biden addresses civil unrest over police brutality of black men and womenVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party.The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment.Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day.At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests.Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday.“Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.”Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines.Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year.“We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.”",0.0

The crosstown trip was excoriated by several Catholic leaders, including Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory of Washington, who said he found it “baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles” by allowing the visit. The Trumps’ visit to the shrine in Northeast Washington came on the 41st anniversary of the start of St. John Paul II’s pilgrimage to his native Poland, the first trip by the pope during which he repeatedly addressed religious and political freedom. The White House said the president offered no remarks during the visit. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accompanied the Trumps during the brief stay at the shrine. Over 100 people, including children and their parents, had gathered near the shrine and began chanting slogans calling for justice for George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis May 25. Archbishop Gregory said Catholic teaching calls the faithful to “defend the rights of all people, even those with whom we might disagree.” The evening before the shrine visit, Trump walked from the White House to St. John Episcopal Church, which was set afire during protests May 31 that called for the nation to address racism and police violence. Authorities fired flash-bang shells, gas and rubber bullets to disperse a crowd that had gathered in Lafayette Square across from the White House so Trump could walk to the church, where he held up a Bible as photographers captured the scene. The crowd was present in the park to protest the death of Floyd and other African American people at the hands of police. Archbishop Gregory in his June 2 statement questioned the decision to disperse the protesters in such a manner. “St. John Paul II was an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings. His legacy bears vivid witness to that truth. He certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.” The shrine issued a statement about the visit less than two hours after the president and first lady left. It said White House officials originally scheduled the visit “as an event for the president to sign an executive order related to global religious freedom.” “This was fitting given St. John Paul II was a tireless advocate of religious liberty throughout his pontificate,” the statement said. “International religious freedom receives widespread bipartisan support, including unanimous passage of legislation in defense of persecuted Christians and religious minorities around the world. “The shrine welcomes all people to come and pray and learn about the legacy of St. John Paul II,” it added. At least one other bishop was critical of the shrine visit. Bishop John E. Stowe of Lexington, Kentucky, tweeted early June 2 that he hoped during the visit “someone proclaims today’s Gospel (Mark 12:13-17) where Herodians and Pharisees are called out for their hypocrisy.” A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said the bishops would not comment on the event because it “was not ours.” Returning to the White House, Trump signed an executive order during the noon hour that the White House described as prioritizing U.S. support for religious freedom worldwide. The order calls for the U.S. to allocate at least $50 million annually for international religious freedom programs. It also would widen economic incentives to support countries that expand religious practice and address attempts to restrict religious practice. In addition, the order would align foreign assistance “to better reflect country circumstances,” restrict issuing visas and implement sanctions under the 2012 Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, which targets human rights abuses and global corruption. The law is named for Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer, who died in 2009 after being arrested and tortured in custody by officers of the Russian Ministry of the Interior. A final provision of the order would mandate more federal employees who work abroad to undergo international religious freedom training. Several observers questioned the president’s commitment to constitutionally protected freedoms given his efforts to limit the rights of refugees seeking asylum and past policies seeking to separate immigrant children from their parents. Trump said June 1 he supports the rights of nonviolent protesters seeking justice for Floyd but that it is necessary to quell rioters who have looted businesses and set buildings and vehicles afire during clashes with authorities that have resulted in millions of dollars in damage and left dozens of people injured. Patricia McGuire, president of Trinity Washington University, a short distance from the shrine, charged that Trump was misappropriating religious symbols for political gain rather than broadly supporting religious freedom. “He’s torn down the wall between church and state … and instead (is) weaponizing religion for his own political goals,” she told Catholic News Service. McGuire called on the U.S. Catholic bishops to stand “shoulder to shoulder at this shrine and tell him in no uncertain terms that this promotion of religion for political purposes is wrong.” Sister Simone Campbell, a Sister of Social Service, who is executive director of the Catholic social justice lobbying group Network, accused the president of having “no clue about the teaching of Pope John Paul II or of our Catholic faith.” “He refusal to acknowledge the racism and police violence that started this and has been rife in our nation, that he exacerbates show he has no evidence of insight or remorse,” Sister Campbell said. “This is crass politics at its worst,” she added. “It’s ignoring the reality of our nation. This is not about religious liberty. This is about human life, human dignity and police violence.” The Trumps’ stay at the shrine lasted about 20 minutes. At one point the couple exited the shrine and posed for pictures next to a statue of St. John Paul II bedecked with a wreath of red and white flowers and a red, white and blue ribbon. They turned to stand in front of the statue for a minute and faced photographers again before returning indoors.

Mike Ricci, Communications Director for Gov. Larry Hogan, said that Maryland has agreed to help the D.C. Guard. “Yes, we agreed to help the DC Guard protect the National Mall and our monuments. If you’re against that mission, I understand, but at least have the facts,” Ricci said on Twitter in response to Maryland Delegate Eric Luedtke’s criticism of the decision. Luedtke had said on Twitter Tuesday, “Turns out Hogan agreed to send Maryland guardsmen to DC despite the Mayor of DC not wanting them there. A disgraceful lack of backbone.” The ACLU of Maryland was also critical of the governor’s decision. They said in a statement on Twitter: “We condemn Gov. Larry Hogan’s decision to send Maryland’s National Guard to the District of Columbia. Emboldening President Trump’s incendiary response to public demands for George Floyd and an end to police brutality, is not only dangerous, but done over the objection of Mayor Muriel Bowser, the District’s elected leader.” President Trump told the nation’s governors in a meeting Monday to “dominate” violent protestors and use aggressive tactics. “If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run all over you, you’ll look like a bunch of jerks,” Trump said. Gov. Hogan, who was on the call, said “I couldn’t agree more with all of the things that you’ve said. We had this experience in Maryland in 2015 when we had the riots in Baltimore and we did exactly what you’re recommending.” According to United States Park Police acting Chief Gregory Monahan, during four days of demonstration, 51 members of the USPP were injured; of those, 11 were transported to the hospital and released and three were admitted. President Trump said during a press conference Monday that there was vandalism to the World War II and Lincoln memorials.",0.0

Floyd died on Memorial Day following an encounter with Minneapolis police. Cell phone video of his arrest showed former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for several minutes as he pleaded for help, telling Chauvin and other officers he couldn’t breathe. RELATED STORIES: Demonstrators held signs and chanted names of police brutality victims during the protest. People also took a knee for eight minutes and 46 seconds to honor Floyd, then chanted in unison. Among the crowd was Wanda Brown. Brown said she was marching for her father, who she said was a victim of police brutality “I feel the pain. I can feel the pain. I’ve been there, and it never ends,” Brown said. “And I hope and pray one day it will change.” Annapolis Police Chief Ed Jackson spoke with protesters before marching with them through downtown Annapolis. Many said they’re hoping their action turn to change. “It’s not about the color of our skin, because if you peel off the layers, it’s all blood,” Tanya Cooper-Johnson, a protester, said. “I’m not going to stop until I feel like my voice is completely heard,” Maya McCollum, a protester, added.

Four people were charged with failure to obey, including a 74-year-old Baltimore woman. A Dundalk man was arrested for throwing fireworks, and a 37-year-old city resident was “arrested while carrying a long gun,” according to the statement released by Baltimore Police Department today. During a day in which large crowds chanting “No justice, no peace!” marched in memory of George Floyd – the black Minneapolis man killed after a police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes – Baltimore police stayed mostly in the background. Police messaging on social media, however, prompted some criticism, especially a Tweet posted by @BaltimorePolice at 2:29 p.m. that said: “The BPD is committed to protecting rights and facilitating peaceful protests to ensure the safety of everyone. Small stashes of potential weapons have been located. If you see something, say something.” Some questioned the reference to “stashes of potential weapons” having been located. “Show us,” Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson tweeted back. There was no reply from police. Protesters were able to march without incident through city streets, at one point shutting down I-83 in both directions. At War Memorial Plaza, the crowd continued the demonstration in front of City Hall, calling for an end to racist policing and reciting the names of other unarmed black people killed by police – Ahmed Aubrey in Florida, Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and many others. • A vivid description of last night, tweeted by activist @SefuChikelu . Drama on Baltimore Street About 9:30 p.m., a group of demonstrators headed south from City Hall toward the Inner Harbor, but were stopped at Baltimore and Commerce streets by city officers in riot gear. An uneasy truce ensued for the next two hours. Fireworks were thrown at police and, at one point, one of the throwers was chased by members of the crowd. “He was lighting fireworks. Lock his ass up,” said Kwame Rose, a prominent activist during the Freddie Gray “Uprising” in 2015. Rose grabbed the protester by his shirt and dragged him to the police past the barricades at City Hall. The incident was recorded by Brew photographer J.M. Giordano. About 11:45 p.m., a battered pickup truck with signs promoting the City Council candidacy of Rodney Hudson turned up on Baltimore Street. Rose commandeered the loudspeaker in the truck and spoke to the crowd: “If you do not want to go to jail, go home. . . Go home! We proved our points,” he said. “We did what we came here to do tonight. Do not turn this into something it does not have to be. “I’ve been when you at five years ago. I’m telling you, tomorrow we come back and show again. Don’t give them what they’re looking for. Don’t give them another excuse. Let’s go. Let’s get home!” Some later praised his actions saying Rose had prevented an escalation that could have turned violent, while others were horrified to see a leader of the action handing someone over to the very police being denounced by the protesters. As the crowd melted away on Baltimore Street, Rose ran to another knot of protesters on South Street. When this group failed to disperse, police charged, pushing about 100 demonstrators up Guilford Avenue to Lexington Street. Under the shadow of Courthouse East, most of the protesters left. The handful that remained lingered without incident at the intersection until after 1 a.m., according to Giordano.",0.0

Amid large-scale civil unrest sparked by police violence and systemic racism, it’s a time to meet the moment. There’s the action of raising a voice, donating money if you can and, if you’re a Baltimore resident, voting. But, as leaders from Baltimore Corps and other local innovators often say, the people who are closest to the problem are the best positioned to figure out the solutions. When it comes to racism, that starts with amplifying Black voices. In a majority-Black city, it’s not a surprise that there is no shortage of such voices to follow. We’ve learned a lot from them in recent years. And we’re thinking a lot about those lessons now. This month was already Racial Equity in Tech Month in Technical.ly’s editorial calendar. As if that wasn’t reason enough, this weekend and this moment further reminds how important it is to support perspectives and messages from Black people. And it’s important to amplify their work, too: As we saw in Baltimore after the uprising that followed Freddie Gray’s funeral in 2015, working to end systemic racism also means extending economic opportunity and creating more intentional pathways into industries where Black people are underrepresented, like tech. Advertisement In that spirit, below, find a very simple, very small step: a list of 10 Black voices in technology who are active on social media and in the Baltimore tech community. They’re engineers, coders and designers. (Check out more community organizers in our recently published RealLIST Connectors.) Some of them we’ve reported on for years, and others we’ve seen speak at events. All are voices worth seeking out and following if you don’t already. I’ve learned a lot from them. Here are just a few of their quotes that are sticking with us: Brittany Young, founder of B360 Bringing together Baltimore’s passion for dirt bikes with opportunity that comes with teaching STEM skills, “it’s become my mission to better get people and organizations ready for STEM students of color,” she told Technical.ly last year. Baltimore is a Black city that you choose to be apart of. Empathize and know once again it’s people are hurting and now is not the time for silence from “allies” — B.Young (@cntknockBhustle) May 31, 2020 John Foster, COO of Fearless Working at the downtown digital services firm for more than a decade, Foster has played a leading role in a company that built a culture oriented toward civic tech and making an impact in Baltimore. He’s also been thoughtful about building companies. “Where we’ve always operated was understanding the strengths of the individuals and putting people in the roles that we know they can do and they can succeed in, and then trust in them to do that,” he told us last year as he and founder Delali Dzirasa transitioned to C-level roles. We all know the truth: more connects us than divides us. But in times of crisis, the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers.

In a conversation last year, it was clear he’s thinking just as much about the city’s economic footing as the technology behind the system. “When we’re exporting capital like that, it puts Baltimore at a further economic disadvantage compared to our neighbors,” he said of his push to keep internet traffic local, instead of sending it through points in other cities. Ashley Jean, software engineer at mdLogix The RealLIST Engineer is mentoring and organizing at events like the Baltimore Hackathon, Bmore on Rails and Code in the Schools. “I feel that it is my duty to give back to that same community because it has to be a domino effect — if we want more people, especially people of color, to be in the tech field we need to give back,” she told Technical.ly last year. Dr. Leshell Hatley, principal investigator for Coppin State Lab for Artificial Intelligence and its Applications Check out her keynote from Code in the Schools’ Girls in CS Summit and her computer science nonprofit, Uplift, Inc.

Brown, professor in Johns Hopkins’ Department of Mechanical Engineering and leader of JHU’s Haptics and Medical Robotics Lab Late in 2019, we heard his thoughts on career paths at Ingenuity Project’s Innovators’ Breakfast. Brown talked about the importance of mentorship from Dr. Willie Rockward, a former Morehouse College professor who is now on the faculty at Baltimore’s Morgan State University. “He told me, ‘You have what it takes to get a Ph.D.’ That stuck with me through the years, knowing that someone believed in me,” Brown said of Rockward.

But when the Canadian prime minister was asked what he thought of President Trump's actions to quash a wave of protests across the U.S., Trudeau paused before responding – for 21 seconds as the cameras recorded his awkward silence. During a Tuesday news conference in front of his Ottawa residence, the prime minister fielded this question from a reporter: ""You've been reluctant to comment about the words and actions of the U.S. president. But we do have now Donald Trump calling for military action against protesters. We saw protesters tear-gassed yesterday to make way for a presidential photo-op. I'd like to ask you what you think about that. And, if you don't want to comment, what message do you think you're sending?"" Before answering, the prime minister, sporting a beard and shaggy hair since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, glanced down at his lectern, opened his mouth as if to speak — then paused, shifted his weight and uttered a barely audible ""um"" as birds chirped in the background. ""We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,"" he finally said. ""It is a time to pull people together, but it is a time to listen. ""It is a time to learn what injustices continue despite progress over years and decades. But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges,"" he said. ""That black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day,"" Trudeau continued. ""There is systemic discrimination in Canada, which means our systems treat Canadians of color, Canadians who are racialized, as differently than they do others."" Trudeau typically displays reticence on Trump's actions, keeping in mind the centrality of the U.S.-Canada relationship and its huge cross-border economic interdependence. Canada in recent days has seen relatively small, peaceful protests in solidarity with U.S. demonstrations that first erupted last week in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. By contrast, the protests in U.S. cities have typically been much larger and have frequently devolved into clashes between police and activists. The Canadian protests supporting Black Lives Matter have sprung up in Montreal, Halifax, Toronto and Regina, the provincial capital of Saskatchewan. At the protest in Regina on Tuesday, when a few hundred people gathered, one of the organizers, Faith Olanipekun, told the CBC that, ""A lot of people here think that Canada isn't racist."" ""So it's important for us to come out, voice our concerns and let people know that we are suffering in Canada just as much as people in the U.S. are suffering,"" Olanipekun said. ",0.0

We want you to continue making your voice heard.”Thousands of protesters remained in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood well after the abolished 9 p.m. curfew Wednesday.

The report also noted Floyd’s lungs appeared healthy but he had some narrowing of arteries in the heart.The county’s earlier summary report listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use under “other significant conditions” but not under “cause of death.” The full report’s footnotes noted that signs of fentanyl toxicity can include “severe respiratory depression” and seizures.--------------------All of the former Minneapolis Police officers charged in connection with the death of George Floyd are now in custody.

Rosenstein told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he relied on lower-level investigators and attorneys to do the right thing in preparing applications for the secret court that authorizes surveillance on Americans. Now, he said, he recognizes via the subsequent investigations that those officials did not do the right thing — and accordingly, Rosenstein said he wouldn't have signed the application. The former deputy attorney general defended the overall need for an investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election and said he stood by its findings and much of its work. But he also acknowledged that it has since become clear he and other Justice Department leaders were acting upon incomplete information. In the case of former Trump aide Carter Page, Rosenstein said he remembered an application for renewal, one that that had been submitted before, and one that he then believed made a cogent case to continue the surveillance. ""My recollection of it was that it was actually fairly persuasive,"" he said. GOP vows more investigation of Russia investigation Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went ahead with a session Wednesday scheduled before the flare in protests and violence that followed the death of a Minneapolis man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in an incident that reignited long-simmering anger at police in cities across the country. The political context has evolved; Republicans want to tie former Vice President Joe Biden into what they call the abuses of power from the end of the Obama era. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said what he called the ""Obama-Biden administration"" had done ""went right up to the very top"" and was worse than the abuses of President Richard Nixon. Cruz also called Rosenstein ""grossly negligent."" He and Republicans sought answers about what Rosenstein and other Justice Department leaders knew at the time they were making fateful decisions about the FBI's investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which sought to hinder Hillary Clinton and help elect then-candidate Donald Trump. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., rejected Cruz's comparison between Obama and Nixon and said it would ""never stand the test of time."" She also said Graham was wasting everyone's time now. ""I have made it very clear that I think that it is absurd we are having this hearing."" Strange days Rosenstein found himself in the center of a political vortex in the spring of 2017, not long after he'd been nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. His boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was a Trump loyalist and had recused himself from the Russian matter. The president had fired FBI Director James Comey. In the midst of that febrile atmosphere, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as a special counsel and continue the Russia investigation. ""I was concerned the public would not have confidence in the investigation and that the acting FBI director [at the time] was not the right person to lead it,"" Rosenstein told senators on Wednesday. ""I decided appointment of special counsel was the best way to complete the investigation and promote public confidence in the conclusions."" Re-look after re-look has verified Mueller's findings about the Russian interference, but the work of the FBI and Justice Department wasn't found to be problem-free. Issues with the FBI investigators involved and their dealings within officialdom, especially with the secret court that oversees government surveillance, have embarrassed the top levels of federal law enforcement. Longtime target Many Republicans have faulted Rosenstein since his earliest days over his appointment of Mueller. Now, Graham brought Rosenstein back into center stage at a time when Trump and other allies want to link Biden with intelligence collection that involved members of the Trump camp. Graham said he also intends to conduct more interviews and hearings about the investigation, including with planned subpoenas. One future witness could include the former deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, Graham said. ""We're going to get to the bottom of it ... this stinks,"" Graham said. ""This is a sad episode on the history of the FBI."" Biden's camp has rejected the idea there were any abuses and pointed out that there was no way for administration officials to single out Americans in intelligence reporting because their names were hidden, or masked. They were only identified after requests for more information about who was talking with existing targets, Biden's campaign said. That practice is legal and takes place thousands of times per year. Trump and allies have made it the basis of political attacks against Biden and others from that era, as Cruz repeated at Wednesday's hearing. Biden, in turn, has blasted Trump and Republicans for what he calls their attempt to distract attention from the most pressing challenges of the day — first the coronavirus pandemic and now the national unrest over police violence. ""Sen. Graham sold his conscience in exchange for a better shot at winning his primary,"" a spokesman for Biden's campaign said Democrats, who are in the minority on the Senate Judiciary Committee, took up that theme on Wednesday, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. She also restated that the findings and much of the work of the Mueller era have been validated. Feinstein emphasized with Rosenstein that the infamous, never-verified Russia dossier was not used as the basis to charge anyone. And Rosenstein underlined what he called the important need to conduct investigations that might not necessarily lead to charges — and that in the case of the Mueller era, no Americans ultimately were charged with conspiring with the Russians who attacked the election. Republicans argue the mere fact of a continued investigation into Page — after evidence surfaced they argue should have quashed it — is improper even though Page was never charged. In Rosenstein's case, he signed a request to continue surveillance on Page based on work product that has since been repudiated by internal investigators and the secret surveillance court. Those details didn't become clear to the public — or Rosenstein, he said on Wednesday — until later. Graham said he accepts that explanation but wants to know why information being gleaned by lower-level investigators wasn't making its way to the leadership of the FBI or Justice. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., tried to emphasize with Rosenstein that although the Page surveillance application process was flawed, none of the other surveillance conducted in the Russia investigation suffered from the same problems. The Page problems don't invalidate the rest of the Mueller work, Leahy argued. Other Democrats complained about the use of the time and energy of the Judiciary Committee to execute what Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, R-R.I., called a political errand for Trump. Graham defended what he called the need to excavate the decisions in the Russia investigation and, meanwhile, has sought to show the Judiciary Committee can keep many plates spinning at once. The committee heard from witnesses on Tuesday about the deadly effects of the coronavirus within the federal prison system and Graham also has planned a hearing later this month about race and policing following Floyd's death.

It is unclear whether the group vandalizing businesses is the same group that gathered nearby in a demonstration earlier. Police say there were nearly 600 people that started to march on Mercury Blvd. around 9 a.m., and then returned to the Target parking lot where they prayed and took a knee with police. Black Lives Matter 757 posted on social media Tuesday saying the gathering organized at Peninsula Town Center was not one of their events.

(AP) — Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional. From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place — in some cases for the first time in decades — sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets. But the deadlines aren’t hard and fast — many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on violent unrest. In New York City, an 11 p.m. curfew was originally put in place this week for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years. Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled it back to 8 p.m., but thousands of people defied the curfew Tuesday night, continuing to march in parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan. After initially standing by and letting protesters continue, officers began ordering people to leave and some people were taken into custody. how NYPD handles curfew violations. tonight near union square pic.twitter.com/7xY7Ia65uR — anastasia proehl (@anastasiaproehl) June 3, 2020 On an overall calmer night in New York City, de Blasio said the relative quiet was due partly to the curfew. ” So far, the curfew is certainly helping, based on everything I’ve seen in Brooklyn and Manhattan over the last three hours,” de Blasio tweeted. A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. And curfews can be a deterrent to get law-abiding citizens off the street and allow police to focus their efforts on the unrest and not get bogged down in run-of-the-mill violations. They have been installed in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit, Denver, Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities and communities across the country. Curfews aren’t unusual in the United States but are typically used in natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes to allow law enforcement to stop anyone on the streets and prevent stealing when many homes and empty or damaged. New York City has used curfews in specific locations like parks — sometimes with controversial results. The 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot in Manhattan had to do in part with a then-newly imposed 1 a.m. parks department curfew in a bid to rid the park of drugs and crime. In enforcing the curfew, police flooded the park with officers and were accused of rampant abuses. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani ramped up enforcement of Central Park’s nightly closure after a string of robberies in the late 1990s. Giuliani was so strict about the curfew, he wouldn’t grant an exception for a late-night vigil to John Lennon, despite intercession from the lord mayor of Liverpool on behalf of aggrieved Beatles fans. During the unrest of the past week, police also want bystanders off the street during unrest — and the curfew solves that. “The curfew really is to keep people from coming sort of to gawk at what’s going on and keep the looky-loos away,” said Sacramento City Councilman Steve Hansen, whose city’s 8 p.m. Monday curfew appeared to help prevent the destructive demonstrations from the night before. The curfews also come on the heels of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, making for an unprecedented stretch in cities like New York. In Columbia, South Carolina, officials lifted a weekend curfew and the mayor joined an afternoon protest at the state capitol calling for police reform. But several dozen people stayed for hours after the protest ended as tensions with police grew as shadows got longer. NOW: police quickly escalated things a block from the Barclays Center, pushing and using batons on protestors, with arrests. #BlackLivesMattter pic.twitter.com/LNQKFKKTNA — Daniel Altschuler 🦋 (@altochulo) June 3, 2020 Just before 7:30 p.m. Monday, Columbia, South Carolina , Mayor Steve Benjamin set a curfew for 7:45 p.m. for a small area of downtown and an areas of restaurants and shops. The city sent an emergency notice and protesters looked at their screens as their phones started to buzz and the curfew set in. The protesters immediately started to walk away. But some civil rights organizations think hastily issued curfews are unfair and against the First Amendment of the Constitution. “By making presence on public streets anywhere in these cities unlawful, these measures give police too much discretion over whom to arrest,” said the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California after a number of cities issued curfews. New York City on Monday found out an unintended consequence of a curfew is keeping away law-abiding protesters. The night before, they banded together to stop vandalism and help police find lawbreakers. It also sends a subtle message, said New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez. “Implementing a curfew and increasing the number of police officers patrolling the streets is a tactic to effectively silence the voices raised in protest against the abuse of power and looting of black and colored bodies by members of the police,” Rodriguez said. Curfews can cause other problems too. Charleston, South Carolina, had a curfew for three days after late night Saturday protests led to shattered windows for restaurants and businesses and stolen merchandise downtown. Monday night was quiet. And Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said he immediately heard from a certain group of people. “We want to give our businesses a chance to get back into business,” Tecklenburg told his City Council at a Tuesday meeting lifting the curfew. A curfew also allows police to separate people who want to protest while following the law from people who want to cause harm, said Tamara Herold, an assistant professor in the Criminal Justice Department at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. That makes it easier for law enforcement to decide how to use force to break up unrest. “One of the things police always want to avoid is using indiscriminate force against a large crowd,” Herold said.",0.0

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) WASHINGTON (AP) — A day after threatening states that he would dispatch the military to quell protests, President Donald Trump appeared to be privately backing off his threat to deploy troops, with White House officials saying this week’s response to demonstrations across the country indicated that local governments should be able to restore order themselves. The shift came as protests in Washington and other cities over police brutality against minorities proceeded Tuesday with relative calm, a striking contrast to the harsh crackdowns outside the White House on Monday night. The president wanted to make the aggressive action in the nation’s capital an example for the rest of the country, a senior White House official said Tuesday. The Defense Department has drafted contingency plans for how to deploy active-duty military if needed. Pentagon documents reviewed by The Associated Press showed plans for soldiers from an Army division to protect the White House and other federal buildings if the security situation in the nation’s capital were to deteriorate and the National Guard could not secure the facilities. But interest in exerting that extraordinary federal authority appeared to be waning in the White House. Though the crackdown on the Washington demonstrations was praised by some Trump supporters Tuesday, a handful of Republicans expressed concern that law enforcement officers risked violating the protesters’ First Amendment rights. The defense secretary also distanced himself from Trump’s decision to walk across Lafayette Park for a photo opportunity at a church after the demonstrators had been cleared. Pentagon Chief Mark Esper, who walked with Trump to St. John’s Church on Monday evening, insisted he did not know the president’s destination. “I didn’t know where I was going,” Esper told NBC News. He said he had expected to view damage to a bathroom facility that had been vandalized in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, and talk with National Guard troops positioned there. The protests have sprung up across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed Floyd’s neck with his knee. Violent demonstrations have raged in scores of American cities, marking a level of unrest unseen for decades. The situation in Washington escalated Monday, becoming a potent symbol of Trump’s policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Nearly 30 minutes before a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington, U.S. Park Police repelled protesters with what they said were smoke canisters and pepper balls. “D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination,” Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added, “(thank you President Trump!).” The clampdown on the protesters followed a weekend of demonstrations outside the White House. Trump had been furious about images juxtaposing fires set in the park outside the executive mansion with a darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials. He was also angry about the news coverage revealing he had been rushed to the White House bunker during Friday’s protests. He moved to respond aggressively Monday. In an evening address in the Rose Garden, he called on governors to ramp up the National Guard presence in their states to tamp down the protests. If they didn’t abide by those orders, Trump said, he would dispatch the military to their states — a step rarely taken in modern American history. The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, the White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was that if they don’t use all the tools in their arsenal, they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response to any request for federal dollars to help with cleanup and recovery down. On Monday, 715 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division arrived in the capital area in case the situation in Washington escalated. They are now stationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Two more 82nd Airborne battalions, totaling 1,300 soldiers, are on standby at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, according to the documents reviewed by the AP. The plan is named Operation Themis. The soldiers on standby in the Washington area are armed and have riot gear and bayonets. After the AP first reported the issuing of bayonets Tuesday, orders came down that soldiers would not need the knife-like weapons that can be affixed to rifles, according to two soldiers from the 82nd who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear they would be punished for commenting publicly. The idea that bayonets could be used in confronting civilians provoked an outcry on social media and among some members of Congress. Already administration officials were privately acknowledging that the Monday’s events didn’t serve the administration well. Some Republican lawmakers, who are typically in lockstep with the president or at least refrain from publicly criticizing him, said he had gone too far in appearing to use force to clear the way for his visit to the church. “There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property, and no right to throw rocks at police,” said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible, “I just wish he opened it once in a while.” Trump’s Cabinet also played a role in what appeared to be an orchestrated event. It was Attorney General William Barr who gave the order for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump’s walk to the church and ahead of Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew. A person familiar with the matter said the decision was made earlier Monday, but had not been executed by the time Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to survey the scene Monday evening. He verbally gave the order at that time. After the demonstrators had been pushed out of the park, Trump emerged from the White House with several officials, including Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Senior defense officials told reporters Milley was also not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said. The White House, Defense, campaign officials and others with knowledge of Monday’s events all insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.",0.0

Hundreds of protesters lined the streets of Roland Avenue in Baltimore Tuesday before they took a knee and were silent at 5:30 p.m. for nine minutes. That time is roughly the amount of time that former police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck before his passing. Once their nine minutes ended, protesters blocked the intersections with signs and chants. The protest was organized by 10-year-old Zachary Wade with the help of his dad, according to The Baltimore Sun. “He’s just an empathetic kid who asked what he could do to help,” Heather Wade, Zachary's mom, told The Sun. Tuesday night, roughly 100 protesters gathered outside Baltimore City Hall and remained peaceful, officials said. In Columbia, protesters marched from The Mall in Columbia before holding a vigil for Floyd Tuesday afternoon.   Around 300 people met at a library in Crofton Tuesday before marching to a community police station in Anne Arundel County. The protesters were escorted by county police. In Annapolis, protesters knelt in silence at the intersection of Chinquapin Round Road and Forest Drive. The protesters marched around City Dock, to the State House before stopping at City Hall, where they demanded to hear from Annapolis Police Chief Ed Jackson.   ---------------------",0.0
1624261341,2020-06-03 07:59:00,How Much Do We Need The Police?,https://www.wypr.org/post/how-much-do-we-need-police,en,False,"politics and government, labor, blacks, police",245165,wypr.org,http://wypr.org/,"One effect of the widespread protests across U.S. cities this week has been to renew discussions of what role the police should play in society. For many Americans, it goes without saying that the police are critical in maintaining public safety. Have an emergency? Call the police. But many others — especially black people and poor people — have long countered that the police pose more of a threat to their safety than a boon. See a police officer? Walk the other direction. So it seems like a good moment to talk to Alex S. Vitale. He's the author of the 2017 book The End of Policing. In it, he argues that rather than focus on police reform or officer retraining, the country needs to fundamentally reconsider what it is the police should be doing at all. I spoke with Vitale about what roles police should and shouldn't play, what he makes of the current protests and what actual change in the way police in this country do their jobs might look like. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. One of the arguments you make in The End of Policing is that police are being asked to do too much. They're basically being tasked with addressing every social problem that we have. So what are police asked to do? And what should they be asked to do? One of the problems that we're encountering here is this massive expansion in the scope of policing over the last 40 years or so. Policing is now happening in our schools. It's happening in relation to the problems of homelessness, untreated mental illness, youth violence and some things that we historically associate police with. But the policing has become more intensive, more invasive, more aggressive. So what I'm calling for is a rethink on why we've turned all of these social problems over to the police to manage. And as we dial those things back, then we can think more concretely about what the rest of policing should look like and how that could be reformed. You brought up homelessness. In many cities police are tasked with dealing with people experiencing homelessness — but they don't have many options besides basically moving people or arresting them. Well, we've created this situation where our political leaders have basically abandoned the possibility of actually housing people. Which, of course, is the real solution, supportive housing for those who need extra support. But basically, we have a massive failure in housing markets that is unable to provide basic shelter for millions of Americans. So instead of actually addressing that fundamental problem, we have relabeled it as a problem that is the fault of the disorderly people who we label as morally deficient. And then we use police to criminalize them, to control their behavior and to reduce their disorderly impact on the rest of us. And this is perverse and unjust. So then it places police in this completely untenable situation, because they completely lack the tools to make this problem any better. And yet we've told them it's their problem to manage. ... Part of our misunderstanding about the nature of policing is we keep imagining that we can turn police into social workers. That we can make them nice, friendly community outreach workers. But police are violence workers. That's what distinguishes them from all other government functions, is that they have the legal capacity to use violence in situations where the average citizen would be arrested. So when we turn a problem over to the police to manage, there will be violence, because those are ultimately the tools that they are most equipped to utilize: handcuffs, threats, guns, arrests. That's what really is at the root of policing. So if we don't want violence, we should try to figure out how to not get the police involved. There are obviously a lot of people who agree broadly with the notion that the way that policing happens in this country is a problem and that there needs to be some sort of change. But they're pretty invested in the idea that police are needed to maintain public safety. People ask the question, without police, what do you do when someone gets murdered? What do you do when someone's house gets robbed? What do you say to those people who have those concerns? Well, I'm certainly not talking about any kind of scenario where tomorrow someone just flips a switch and there are no police. What I'm talking about is the systematic questioning of the specific roles that police currently undertake, and attempting to develop evidence-based alternatives so that we can dial back our reliance on them. And my feeling is that this encompasses actually the vast majority of what police do. We have better alternatives for them. Even if you take something like burglary — a huge amount of burglary activity is driven by drug use. And we need to completely rethink our approach to drugs so that property crime isn't the primary way that people access drugs. We don't have any part of this country that has high quality medical drug treatment on demand. But we have policing on demand everywhere. And it's not working. Obviously, a big part of what is on people's minds right now is the role that police have in dealing with protesters, dealing with different types of political unrest. In your book, you talk a lot about the history of how police have been used to quell social unrest. Can you talk about that history a little bit? Well, I think that one of the myths we have about policing is that it is politically neutral, and that it is always here to sort of create order in a way that benefits everyone. But the reality is that America's social order has never been entirely equitable. We have a long history of exploitation of the indigenous population, of African Americans through slavery, Jim Crow and today. And while we're not using police to manage slavery or colonialism today, we are using police to manage the problems that our very unequal system has produced. We're invested in this kind of austerity politics that says the government can't afford to really do anything to lift people up. We have to put all our resources into subsidizing the already most successful parts of the economy. But those parts of the economy are producing this huge group of people who are homeless, unemployed, have untreated mental health and substance abuse problems. And then we ask the police to put a lid on those problems — to manage them so they don't interfere with the ""order"" that we're supposedly all benefiting from. But if you're one of those poor people, one of those folks with a mental health problem, someone who's involved in black market activities to survive, then you experience this as constant criminalization. And would you say the same goes for people who are political protesters? Political protest has always been a part of this dynamic, right? Political protests are a threat to the order of this system. And so policing has always been the primary tool for managing those threats to the public order. Just as we understand the use of police to deal with homelessness as a political failure, every time we turn a political order problem over to the police to manage, that's also a political failure. I think the mayor of Minneapolis, for instance: Jacob Frey. He has consistently tried to frame this as a problem of a few bad apples. And he says, ""Why are you protesting? We fired them."" But this completely misunderstands the nature of the grievances. And instead of actually addressing those grievances, he's throwing police at the problem. Are the interactions that are happening right now between police and protesters something that you think is predictable? Or is this something new that we haven't seen before? It's not completely new, it's just the intensity of it compared to, let's say, five years ago during the Eric Garner and the Mike Brown protests. What we're seeing is really an immediate escalation to very high levels of force, a high degree of confrontation. And I think part of it is driven by deep frustration within policing, which is that police feel under assault, and they have no answer. They trotted out all the possible solutions: police-community dialogue sessions, implicit bias training, community policing, body cameras. And it just didn't work. It didn't make any difference. And so they ran out of excuses. So the protests today are a much more kind of existential threat to the police. And the police are overreacting as a result. If we were to take serious steps toward moving in the direction of having police address fewer of our social problems and putting those problems in the hands of people who are actually more equipped to deal with them, what would be the next step? What is the next thing that we as a country have to push for? I think this will look like a series of local budget battles. And that's really what's going on across the country, is when we have these divest campaigns in places like Los Angeles and Minneapolis and New York and Durham, North Carolina and Nashville, Tennessee and Dallas, Texas. These are folks who are saying concretely: ""We don't want police in our schools. We want that money spent in ways that help our children, not criminalize them. We don't want more money for overtime for narcotics officers. We want actual drug treatment programs, safe injection facilities, things that will help people."" So that's what this looks like. It's about rallying city council members and mayors around a new vision of creating healthier communities. When you're looking around at what's happening right now, what are the things that you think people need to understand to really process what is going on around the country? Well, I think the police are making the argument for us, right? People started this conversation by saying policing is out of control; they're not making the situation better. They have not been reformed. Well, now all you have to do is turn on the nightly news and see how true that is. The level of aggression and unnecessary escalation is stark evidence of how unreformed policing is, and I argue how unreformable it is. The question is whether or not people will take it to the next step and ask the tough political questions. Why are our mayors turning this over to the police to manage? Why are we using curfews instead of having conversations? Why are we throwing protesters in prison instead of trying to figure out what's driving all of this anger? ",0.0

Of course Floyd was black and the cop is white, which further exacerbates the situation. We’ve seen white cops killing unarmed black people over and over again on the news. Sometimes the circumstances seem to provide a reason the cop could have made a mistake and took a shot. Other times it seems the policeman involved was just eager to shoot. The death of Floyd rises to another level. If I try to put myself into a policeman’s shoes that shot an unarmed black person, or white person for that matter, there are some viable reasons that could force me to take a lethal type action. I have no training at all in these matters, so from my layman’s perspective; if it’s dark and a suspect makes any move other than what he’s been directed to do, well, good luck suspect! None of that applies here. Police were called because Floyd was accused of passing a counterfeit $20 bill. It was still daylight and Floyd was cuffed without any resistance, at least not on any video I’ve seen. Floyd was put into a squad car and there appears to be some sort of scuffle in the back seat. The next thing I saw was a prone Floyd in cuffs with police officer Derek Chauvin pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck. Whatever issue there was with Floyd was over quickly, or so it would seem, I mean he was handcuffed. Instead, Chauvin kept his knee pressed into Floyd’s neck for over nine minutes. For an untimed portion of that time Floyd could be heard begging for his life. For the final stages of the nine minutes Floyd was unresponsive for a period of time, yet Chauvin continued to apply pressure. Other officers stood by and did nothing. Chauvin has been charged with manslaughter and third degree murder. Those charges seem weak in this case and that fact has fueled the anger. What has followed defies logic. Everyone should be outraged by this act regardless of ethnicity, but many of the demonstrations around the country turned from peaceful to violent. I mean how does looting and arson make a point?",0.0

The pope is urging the U.S. to reach a national reconciliation, after days of protests and violence. ""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,"" the pope said on Wednesday. He added, ""At the same time, we have to recognize that 'the violence of recent nights is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost.' "" On Wednesday, Francis says, he is joining the faithful in Minneapolis and across the U.S. ""in praying for the repose of the soul of George Floyd and of all those others who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism."" The prayers, he added, would be for consolation for their grieving families, and for reconciliation and peace. In the pope's remarks about violent protests, he was quoting Archbishop José H. Gomez, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who recently issued a statement condemning Floyd's death. In that statement, Gomez asked, ""How is it possible that in America, a black man's life can be taken from him while calls for help are not answered and his killing is recorded as it happens?"" With riots breaking out in many U.S. cities, Gomez cited America's most famous civil rights leader: ""It is true what Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, that riots are the language of the unheard. We should be doing a lot of listening right now."" The pope's message to the U.S. was part of his address during Wednesday's general audience at the Vatican. Here's the full text of that portion of his remarks: ""I greet the English-speaking faithful joining us through the media. ""Dear brothers and sisters in the United States, I have witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest in your nation in these past days, following the tragic death of Mr. George Floyd. ""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life. At the same time, we have to recognize that ""the violence of recent nights is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost,"" ""Today I join the Church in Saint Paul and Minneapolis, and in the entire United States, in praying for the repose of the soul of George Floyd and of all those others who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism. Let us pray for the consolation of their grieving families and friends and let us implore the national reconciliation and peace for which we yearn. May Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mother of America, intercede for all those who work for peace and justice in your land and throughout the world. ""May God bless all of you and your families. """,0.0
