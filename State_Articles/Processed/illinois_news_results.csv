1616133823,2020-05-25 05:29:01,Idahos Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin Has Gone Rogue Over Coronavirus,https://www.thedailybeast.com/idahos-lt-gov-janice-mcgeachin-has-gone-rogue-over-coronavirus?source=articles&via=rss,en,False,,658820,State News - United States - Idaho,http://www.idaho.statenews.net/,"When the Republican governor of Idaho issued a plan to safely reopen businesses in the state, he ordered bars to stay closed until at least June 13. Last weekend, in defiance of those guidelines, Idaho’s lieutenant governor—also a Republican—reopened the tavern she owns with her family in Idaho Falls. A few days before reopening The Celt Pub and Grill, Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin penned a scathing op-ed in which she slammed Gov. Brad Little’s oversight of the coronavirus pandemic. “As Lieutenant Governor, I am one heartbeat away from the governor’s chair,” McGeachin wrote. State residents, she added, were “sidelined and left to watch silently as the government closed Main Street by unilaterally deciding which businesses were ‘essential’ and which ones were not.” The definition of “essential” workers came from the White House, not the statehouse, but that was lost in the remarkable animosity between Idaho’s top leaders. According to the Idaho Statesman, McGeachin and Little have not spoken in weeks. As the country enters its third month of lockdown amid a slumping economy, right-wing protesters often funded by a network of deep-pocketed conservative groups, have called for states to be “liberated” from a patchwork of measures meant to slow the spread of COVID-19. But public health experts warn that reopening prematurely will only make things worse. Weeks after it reopened, Texas has experienced a surge in COVID-19 deaths. A majority of Americans, on both sides of the aisle, say the nation is reopening too quickly, but among politicians the dispute is largely split down party lines. In Georgia, the Democratic mayors of Atlanta, Savannah, and Albany are opposed to Republican governor Brian Kemp’s reopening plan, saying it is too early. The Democratic mayor of Des Moines, Frank Cownie, has criticized Iowa governor Kim Reynolds, a Republican, for the same reason. However, the feud between McGeachin and Little is playing out among two conservatives in a deep red state. Idaho state representative Greg Chaney, a Republican who has been openly critical of McGeachin’s position on reopening, told The Daily Beast he hasn’t seen anything like it in his lifetime. “This particular administration has been in office not quite two years, and so their working relationship is relatively new,” said Chaney, “but historically I can't recall a similar example, even [back in the 1980s] when we had a Repubiclan lieutenant governor and a Democratic governor.” In Idaho, the governor and lieutenant governor are elected individually. Little clinched Idaho’s 2018 Republican gubernatorial primary with 37 percent of the vote; McGeachin won with 29 percent. They both were voted into office with 60 percent of the vote in the general election. Neither responded to requests for comment for this story. The day after Little’s broad stay-at-home order eased earlier this month, McGeachin attended a “Disobey Idaho” protest outside the state capitol building. “Disobey Idaho” was organized by the Idaho Freedom Foundation (IFF), a right-wing group backed by the conservative State Policy Network. In a blog post, Wayne Hoffman, the IFF’s executive director, told followers that the state, country, and economy “are in a death spiral, inflicted by our elected officials and their teams of ‘health experts.’” Following her appearance at the demonstration, McGeachin flew to the town of Kendrick with Idaho GOP chairman Raul Labrador to support the reopening of the Hardware Brewery, a local brewpub, which authorities said was restricted from opening until mid-June. A week later, the Idaho State Alcohol Beverage Control Bureau warned the establishment that its liquor license could be pulled if it continued to violate the governor’s order by staying open. McGeachin accused Little of abusing his power to “harass and intimidate private businesses.” Hardware Brewery co-owner Christine Lohman took it a step further, comparing Idaho under Little’s leadership to Nazi Germany. The brewery has remained open, contrary to state orders, Lohman told The Daily Beast. She said she is unsure if the business will be fined or penalized, but that she has been in touch with the Idaho Department of Health about safety guidelines. The establishment has “met them on some of it,” including canceling events and using paper plates and disposable cutlery, Lohman explained, but said they’re still “trying to work on the social distancing.” “I don’t have so much of an issue that they want us to do it, but I don't think private businesses should be told by the government to police the public,” she continued. “Our public are critical-thinking adults, for me to say, ‘I need to check your temperature,’ or that only six people can sit together although eight or 10 came in together... I say, ‘When is it going to stop?’” Lohman and her husband have depleted their retirement savings in an attempt to keep the brewery’s lights on, she said. Little, however, “has not lost his check, he has not lost his medical.” “The lieutenant governor has more stones than the governor,” said Lohman. “Brad Little has acted like a Democrat through this whole thing, and the people know it. These are people who want their freedom. This is the perfect time for America to fight for its civil rights.” McGeachin, 57, was a delegate for Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican National Convention, and vice-chair of Idaho’s statewide committee to elect Trump. Her 2018 campaign website for lieutenant governor, which is still active, boasts a photo of her in a MAGA hat alongside Donald Trump Jr., under the headline: “President Trump Keeps Making America Great Again!” Born in New Mexico, the staunchly anti-abortion McGeachin is Idaho’s first female lieutenant governor. In addition to The Celt, which opened in 2012, McGeachin and her husband operate a successful auto transmission business. Last year, on the 24th anniversary of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City by white supremacists, McGeachin administered an oath at a rally hosted by a right-wing militia called the Real Three Percent of Idaho, which the Southern Poverty Law Center says is part of an “extreme anti-government” movement. A month earlier, McGeachin was photographed posing with far-right militia members in what appeared to be a message of support for Todd Engel, who is currently serving a 14-year sentence for his part in an armed confrontation with federal agents. The escalating conflict seen now between McGeachin and Little is “emblematic of the same chaotic approach to the pandemic we are seeing at the federal level,” Craig Holman, a government affairs expert at the watchdog nonprofit Public Citizen, told The Daily Beast. “Though Trump and Pence are more or less in agreement, the constant contradicting of senior health officials by Trump has rendered the government's response to the pandemic listless at best,” said Holman. “Fortunately for some states, Trump has now decided to turn over control of the pandemic policies to the states. However, for Idaho, the state response will be as divided and chaotic as it has been at the federal level.” As a business owner, McGeachin clearly has a financial stake in reopening, though she has pushed back at the idea that her family broke any rules by re-launching dine-in and drink-in service in mid-May. Under the state order, bars don’t reopen until May 30, but McGeachin said in a Facebook post that The Celt is a restaurant and was allowed to reopen earlier. But she also put The Celt in the same category as Hardware Brewery, which has already been cited for breaking the rules.The Celt says it is taking precautions: operating at 50 percent capacity; capping parties at six people; using paper menus. But while employees are required to wear face masks during their shifts, customers are not. That endangers staff as well as other diners in the space, said Luisa Franzini, chair of the School of Public Health at the University of Maryland, College Park. “There should be social distancing, wearing of masks, and so on,” even for outdoor dining, Franzini told The Daily Beast, adding that she believes indoor dining remains unsafe. “I haven't found two jurisdictions that have the same policy. It makes you feel that your health and safety are really dependent on where you happen to live.” An employee who answered the phone at The Celt told The Daily Beast that staff members were instructed not to speak with reporters. Idaho has more than 2,400 confirmed cases of COVID-19 to date. In some parts of the state, the rate of COVID-19 infections has been low. Of Idaho’s 44 counties, 11 haven’t had a single case, Greg Chaney explained. Yet, he said, Blaine County, where the Sun Valley ski resort is located, at one point exceeded the per capita infection rate of any other place in the country, including New York City—the “hottest spot” in the U.S. “I think it’s understandable to express disagreement, or even frustration, given everything that’s going on,” Chaney said, “but I think it’s important that we all look for constructive ways to express that. “While we’re in the heat of the moment, trying to get people to work together to address what’s happening, it’s certainly poor timing to undermine the governor in charge.” “Governors across the country have proven themselves to be real leaders during this time, particularly given the dearth of strategy from the White House,” adds Democratic strategist Andrew Taverrite. “I would think Idahoans—like the rest of the country—are looking for science-based information rather than political fights right now.” McGeachin’s stance on reopening doesn’t much surprise Deborah David-Simonds, a retired RN living in Idaho Falls. David-Simonds notes that while McGeachin has actively encouraged Idahoans to disobey Gov. Little’s stay-at-home order, Little has taken a “thoughtful approach” to reopening. He has listened to advice from state health officials, further drawing criticism from the right, David-Simonds told The Daily Beast. She sees the issue as a health concern, nothing more, and can’t comprehend “why masks are seen as a violation of someone’s constitutional rights.” And although business closures have taken a great toll on people’s finances, Luisa Franzini urges people to consider the bigger picture. “Of course there is individual freedom, but the freedom ends when your freedom starts hurting someone else,” she said. “In the case of an epidemic, it’s justified to put some restrictions on people, and some just ideologically are not accepting that.”",0.0

Feeling fully in the throes of a never-ending limbo, leaning on music as a grounding source of energy has felt more important than ever. Luckily for fans of R&B, hip-hop, pop and soul, our favorite artists have kept new music coming. Whether they're making daily creations or finally letting go of months' worth of work, we're thankful for new sounds to fill these moments of unrest and static. Clever storyteller Amaarae talks big and backs it up in spades. Left-of-center savant Dijon breaks the mold of song structure. Ambient architects like Ava Hovanka and Matt McGhee lean into their instincts while Teyana Taylor captures the silver lining of this moment. These are the new tracks that are putting names and numbers on the swirl of unfamiliar emotions. Stream Heat Check's latest cream of the crop on Spotify now. Odunsi (The Engine), ""Body Count (feat. Amaarae, DETO BLACK and Gigi Atlantis)"" With his latest EP, EVERYTHING YOU HEARD IS TRUE, Odunsi (The Engine) is as an architect of the unpredictable. Throughout the tape's brisk and breezy 14 minutes, it's definitely Amaarae who steals the show on ""Body Count."" The Ghanaian American singer cuts it up better than a moon-walking sellsword with her whispered tale of a Fed-fighting former fling. Drop down and hit that quarantine twerk to this one. ""That's not my man, that's my migo / Talk big money, yeah he got a big ego / Big dick for me, then he fighting off the R.I.C.O. / Quarter mil in court cases / Flew off to the fort, bored, betting on the races."" — Sidney Madden Tkay Maidza, ""Shook"" The Zimbabwe-born, Australia-based rapper is as ferocious as she is refined on ""Shook,"" her first official release under her new label, 4AD. Tkay gets more gully with every verse as her rhymes glide over spiraling, disjointed production before diverging into a swampy NOLA bounce breakdown. — Sidney Madden Teyana Taylor, ""Made It"" In a time when graduation celebrations can't be communally experienced, Teyana Taylor fashioned one of her latest singles, ""Made It,"" into a triumphant, isolation-proof anthem for the Class of 2020. Taylor asked fans to send in their at-home graduation videos and combined them all for a joyful cyber ceremony. ""Unfortunately, this pandemic has stopped us from physically gathering and celebrating all the hard work you've put in through the years,"" the artist wrote on Instagram when dropping the song and video. ""But this pandemic can't stop your spirit, it can't dim your light, and it can't take your degree away from you!! So when you make it out of this dark time, shine bright and light up the world."" — Sidney Madden Matt McGhee, ""Muscle Memory"" Washington D.C.-based Matt McGhee clearly knows how to make the most of time. Under two minutes, he crafts a record that vividly explains the role of spirituality in his life over a revved-up sample made famous by A Tribe Called Quest. If that's not enough, we get a complete beat switch before it's over. I'm a sucker for a beat switch. — Bobby Carter Dornik, ""Limboland (feat. Phonte)"" The hiatus is over and Dornik has returned from the future to deliver his sophomore album. The self-produced title track to Limboland yet again displays his masterful ability to tow the line between ambient and hard-hitting sonics. North Carolina's finest, Phonte of Little Brother, adds some bars to take it over the top. — Bobby Carter Ava Hovanka, ""Sleeping"" The Washington D.C.-hailing singer-songwriter stirs up a potion of ambient serenity with ""Sleeping."" At just over three minutes, the track strikes a balance between haunting and ascendant while Hovanka tries to work through her racing thoughts rather than brush them off. — Sidney Madden Dijon, ""rock n roll"" How Do You Feel About Getting Married?, the latest EP from Dijon, marks a new peak in cerebral, soul-slicing honesty for the LA artist. Drizzled with R&B finesse and brash rock exuberance, ""rock n roll"" is the cut I keep coming back to. Over a flurry of screeching guitar, Dijon's words capture a fleeting moment of opposites-attract fixation. ""She don't like the Rolling Stones / But I won't give up, it's automatic / I just wanna see her dance around the room / To Joni's Blue / Punk rock won't stop / Roxy music, Iggy Pop."" — Sidney Madden Mk.gee, ""cz"" When it comes to influences, this 23-year-old singer-songwriter and producer's cup runneth over. His aptly titled mixtape, A Museum of Contradiction, defies genre while authentically honoring a wide span of musical tastes. The first single ""cz"" is equal parts dark indie-pop and rock cut with drums that swing toward hip-hop. A hook line and sinker to my ears. — Bobby Carter ",0.0

1617933552,2020-05-27 05:00:00,Shuttle Veteran Leads First Human Space Mission Launched From U.S. Since 2011,https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/shuttle-veteran-leads-first-human-space-mission-launched-us-2011,en,False,,138019,boisestatepublicradio.org,http://boisestatepublicradio.org/,"When NASA astronauts launch from the Kennedy Space Center, it will be the first time humans have blasted off from the U.S. since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011. The pilot of that final shuttle mission was Doug Hurley, and he's aboard again Wednesday, ready to make history with the launch of SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule. When Hurley and his crew cleared the tower aboard Atlantis on July 8, 2011, the future of human spaceflight from Florida was uncertain. Getting to space was going to require hitching a ride on Russia's Soyuz capsules lifting off from Kazakhstan. A U.S. replacement ride was at least four years away. In fact, budget cuts and technical challenges delayed NASA's Commercial Crew Program for almost a decade. The $6 billion program aims to launch astronauts to the International Space Station using commercial companies — SpaceX and Boeing. After the final shuttle mission, Hurley worked at NASA's Johnson Space Center to develop the Commercial Crew Program. In 2015, he was selected as one of the first Commercial Crew astronauts. Now he will once again fly to space — something that surprises even him. ""I certainly didn't expect to fly again,"" says Hurley, who also flew on the space shuttle Endeavour in 2009. ""I certainly didn't necessarily have a plan to fly again. And if I did, it would have had to have been a case where somebody would have wanted me to."" Hurley joined NASA in 2000 as part of an astronaut class that called themselves the Bugs, after the Y2K computer glitch of that year. He was selected for his test-flight skills and had clocked over 5,500 hours in more than two dozen military aircraft before joining the space agency. Terry Virts, a former test pilot-turned-astronaut who also joined NASA in 2000, says of Hurley: ""He's just solid. He's not going to make any mistakes."" Virts adds, ""He's going to stay cool no matter what happens. He's definitely a very good choice. I know why our bosses picked him for this job."" The focus of this flight, known as Demonstration Mission 2, will put Hurley's test pilot skills to use. He and co-pilot Bob Behnken are tasked with flying SpaceX's Crew Dragon for the first time. The duo will put the sleek capsule through its paces, flying it using a touch screen and iPads before it docks with the space station. The launch is set for 4:33 p.m. ET Wednesday, and the spacecraft will dock with the station about 18 hours later. The astronauts will spend anywhere from one to four months on the station. Like Hurley, Behnken, another Bug, is a veteran of two shuttle missions, one in 2008 and another two years later. He says Hurley is cool under pressure and dedicated to the mission. ""I always know that Doug is going to be one step ahead of me and ready for whatever's kind of coming in front of us,"" he says. ""He's going to be the one who's ready a second and a half before I am."" The mission is a critical test flight that will — if all goes well — pave the way for more astronauts to fly to the station from the United States. NASA is out of rides to the space station from Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, and Boeing, the second commercial partner, is facing delays getting its capsule certified for launch. Hurley and Behnken will spend 18 hours in space, testing and certifying all of the systems of the Crew Dragon — from flying it in orbit to sleeping on board to testing the spacecraft's toilet. ""You want to know that when it hits the fan, when things don't go as planned, that you have these people with you that will have your back, and that they know you'll have theirs,"" says fellow class of 2000 astronaut Nicole Stott, who is now retired from NASA. ""That's Doug,"" she says. ",0.0

The disturbing video of Monday night's death — during which a white officer's knee was planted firmly on George Floyd's neck and his desperate calls for help were ignored — has prompted protests in the Minnesota city and demands for charges for the officers involved. At a news conference Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to ""act on the evidence before him"" and press charges on the arresting officer. ""Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail? If you had done it or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now. And I cannot come up with a good answer to that question,"" Frey told a news conference Wednesday. ""We watched for five whole excruciating minutes as a white officer firmly pressed his knee into the neck of an unarmed, handcuffed black man,"" he added, noting that the arresting officer was not practicing a technique condoned by the city's police. ""I saw no threat; I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary."" Frey refrained from specifying what charges he would like to see, citing a desire not to impede investigators. But Floyd's sister Bridgett went one step further on national television earlier Wednesday. ""I would like for those officers to be charged with murder because that's exactly what they did,"" she told the Today show. ""They murdered my brother; he was crying for help."" She said the family, which has retained legal representation, is far from satisfied with the announcement that the four officers in the video have been fired — a swift decision that Frey said was ""the right call."" The Minneapolis Police Department has not publicly confirmed the officers' identities, and it said the FBI is also investigating the circumstances of Floyd's death. The announcement also failed to satisfy protesters who on Tuesday evening thronged to the department's 3rd Precinct, where clashes erupted between demonstrators and law enforcement in riot gear. As Minnesota Public Radio reported, the demonstrators damaged the building and a squad car in a confrontation that eventually saw police firing tear gas into the crowd. ""What we witnessed today was state-sponsored murder, a state-sponsored execution,"" Steven Belton, president of the nonprofit Urban League Twin Cities, said at a gathering of local civil rights leaders earlier Tuesday outside City Hall. ""And what we await to see is whether it's going to become state-sanctioned execution. It'll be sanctioned if nothing is done."" The controversy engulfing Minneapolis is not unfolding in a vacuum. Already a video recorded earlier this year in Georgia — depicting the death of an unarmed black man, who was followed and shot by two white men while out for a jog three months ago — has renewed questions about the conduct of local police, who did not arrest the men until after the video surfaced this month. And this week, a recorded encounter in New York City's Central Park caught fire after it was posted to social media. In the video, a white woman calls the police on a black man, who says he had simply asked her to leash her dog while he was out bird-watching. ""He's recording me and threatening me and my dog,"" she tells emergency operators multiple times as the man recording her keeps his distance. After the video surfaced, the woman was fired by her employer, the investment firm Franklin Templeton. The video recorded in Minneapolis more closely called to mind an earlier death in New York City, however. Like Eric Garner, who died after an officer's chokehold in 2014, Floyd's final words before he appeared to lose consciousness were a plea for help: ""I can't breathe."" Floyd is seen wailing the phrase several times with his face planted on the pavement, his hands apparently cuffed behind his back and a male officer kneeling on his neck. Observers standing nearby are heard telling officers that Floyd's nose was bleeding and that he was dying. The officer and his colleagues show little reaction as the man gradually goes silent. The officer does not lift his weight off Floyd's neck throughout most of the video until medical workers arrive to lift him into an ambulance on a stretcher. The New York City police officer who used the chokehold on Garner, Daniel Pantaleo, was never charged with a crime but was fired last year on a judge's recommendation. The Floyd family's attorney emphasized the link with Garner in comments Wednesday to the Today show. ""It's worse than Eric Garner in many ways,"" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said, ""because you hear the people even pleading with them, 'Please get your knee off his neck. Have some humanity; this is a human being,' "" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement Tuesday, ""There must be a complete and thorough outside investigation into what occurred, and those involved in this incident must be held accountable. Justice must be served for this man and his family, justice must be served for our community, and justice must be served for our country."" ",0.0

""After careful study of developments over the reporting period, I certified to Congress today that Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under United States laws in the same manner as U.S. laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997,"" Pompeo said in a statement released Wednesday. ""No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground."" The secretary announced his decision at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China. President Trump has blamed Chinese authorities for failing to prevent the coronavirus from becoming a global pandemic, noting that his administration is ""not going to take it lightly."" And earlier this month the Senate trained its legislative fire on China, with a unanimously passed bill that could force some foreign companies off U.S. stock exchanges. The State Department also has pushed back hard against China's recent plans for an aggressive new security law that would criminalize behavior in Hong Kong seen as critical of Beijing. In a statement shortly after news of the proposed legislation surfaced, Pompeo called it ""a death knell for the high degree of autonomy."" For more than two decades, the semiautonomous region has been governed under a principle Beijing calls ""one country, two systems,"" which allows Hong Kong certain freedoms from the communist economic and legal systems practiced on mainland China. Partly for that reason, the U.S. treats Hong Kong as separate from the rest of China as long as the city remains sufficiently autonomous. But the relationship between Beijing and Hong Kong's residents has grown increasingly fraught in recent years, with the city periodically erupting into massive demonstration against what protesters and the U.S. call Beijing's attempts to encroach on its freedoms. The region again saw clashes between protesters and riot police last weekend. One of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, Joshua Wong, urged leaders abroad to reconsider whether its ""special trade status can still be held since, once the law is implemented, Hong Kong will be assimilated into China's authoritarian regime, on both rule of law and human rights protections."" Now, that status appears in jeopardy with the Trump administration's reappraisal. ""Hong Kong and its dynamic, enterprising and free people have flourished for decades as a bastion of liberty, and this decision gives me no pleasure,"" Pompeo said Wednesday. ""But sound policymaking requires a recognition of reality. While the United States once hoped that free and prosperous Hong Kong would provide a model for authoritarian China, it is now clear that China is modeling Hong Kong after itself.""

Gretchen Whitmer's COVID-19 emergency orders. The orders include a ban on barbers and hair salons doing business during the declared crisis. Manke's refusal to follow the Democratic governor's shutdown order sparked a May 20 demonstration in front of the Michigan Capitol. Dozens of barbers and hairstylists openly defied the order with free haircuts. The Michigan State Police issued seven citations at the demonstration. Manke's attorney argued, among other things, that the order to pull his barber's license and close his shop violated his First Amendment right to protest the reach of the governor's executive orders. The Court of Appeals disagrees: ""Here, the State has an important governmental interest in containing the spread of COVID-19,"" the decision reads, then continues to say that the governor's executive order is ""directed at that interest and not at any speech or expressive conduct."" The majority decision said Shiawassee Circuit Court Judge Matthew Stewart should have granted the state's request to enforce the shutdown order and that he should not second-guess the actions of Whitmer and her experts as they try to manage a public health crisis. Manke could appeal the decision to the Michigan Supreme Court, but, in the meantime, his license remains suspended. One appeals court judge, Brock Swartzle, issued a partial dissent from two other judges on the panel who made the decision. Within minutes of the decision going public, Swartzle announced he is seeking the Republican nomination to run for a seat on the Michigan Supreme Court. ",0.0

But he also said he cannot allow the kind of looting, fires and business damage that stemmed from street protests Wednesday night. And the city’s mayor said he’s requesting state assistance and allowing Arradondo to use resources from other jurisdictions. “We must confront our shortcomings with humility as well as hope. We must restore the peace so that we can do this hard work together,” Mayor Jacob Frey said. Fury has been rising in Minneapolis over Monday’s death of Floyd, a black man who died after pleading for help as a police officer pinned him — unarmed and handcuffed — to the ground. On Wednesday night, Minneapolis’ second day of protests transitioned to rioting and looting south of downtown, with people smashing their way into stores and setting businesses and other buildings ablaze. One of Floyd’s brothers cried Thursday morning as he said his family wants protests to be peaceful, but stressed people are struggling with seeing another black man die following a police encounter, this one over the passing of an allegedly counterfeit $20 bill at a store. “I want everybody to be peaceful right now, but people are torn and hurt, because they’re tired of seeing black men die,” George Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, said on CNN’s “New Day.” “These officers (involved in George’s arrest) need to be arrested right now … and held accountable about everything because these people want justice right now,” he said. A man was fatally shot overnight near the protests, police said early Thursday. One person was arrested, and police said they’re investigating the nature of the incident. As the protests developed, demonstrators threw water bottles and firecrackers at officers and a police precinct building. Fires eventually broke out at businesses in the area, including an AutoZone. Flames lit up a building under construction, one floor eventually collapsing. At a nearby Target, video shows people taking cartloads of goods and loading them into their cars. People also raided a grocery store. On Thursday morning its exterior glass lay shattered and the floor was littered with groceries as a interior fire sprinkler system sprayed water. An unspecified number of police officers and other people suffered minor injuries in the protests, Arradondo said, without elaborating. Demonstrations were held elsewhere in the country Wednesday night. In Los Angeles, hundreds of protesters marched. At one point, some attacked a California Highway Patrol car. In Memphis, Tennessee, police in riot gear responded to a protest and at least two people were arrested, CNN affiliate WHBQ reported. The unrest followed shock and anger that spread through communities across the country as bystander video of Floyd’s last moments alive began circulating on social media. The 46-year-old man was arrested Monday evening after, police said, officers were called to investigate alleged forgery at a corner store called Cup Foods. Mahmoud Abumayyaleh, an owner of the store, told CNN a staff member called police to report someone using a fake $20 bill. Police arrived, and Floyd, a suspect in the incident, was handcuffed and pinned on the ground. As he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe, a police officer held him down with a knee on his neck. Three other officers also were at the scene. The Minneapolis Police Department this week fired the four officers involved in Floyd’s arrest. The cause of Floyd’s death hasn’t been released, and the incident is being investigated by local, state and federal authorities. Floyd’s family wants charges against four officers Floyd, a 46-year-old Houston native, worked security at Conga Latin Bistro in Minneapolis for five years, according to its owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He moved to Minneapolis for work and to drive trucks, his friend of more than 20 years, former NBA player Stephen Jackson, said. Jackson said Floyd, a father of two girls, was like a brother to him, and they used to refer to each other as twins. “He was just a great dude … somebody that wanted to be a protector and provider for everybody around him,” Jackson told CNN Thursday. “It sucks that the whole world had to see my friend go that way. … He didn’t deserve that, but the way that people are supportive of him and standing up for him … his death will not be in vain.” No charges have been filed in Floyd’s death, but his family say they want murder charges for all four fired officers. Who the officers are In a news conference Wednesday, Mayor Frey also called for criminal charges to be brought against the officer who kept his knee on Floyd. That officer was identified by his attorney Tom Kelly as Derek Chauvin. Kelly has not released a statement on Chauvin’s behalf. In an interview aired Thursday, Frey told CBS News that he believed Floyd’s death constituted murder. “I am not a prosecutor, but let me be clear: The arresting officer killed someone,” Frew told CBS. “He (Floyd) would be alive today if he were white.” The other three officers were identified by police as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. Thomas Plunkett, representing Kueng, said, “At this time, out of respect for Mr. Floyd, we are declining all invitations to discuss these painful events.” Earl Gray is representing another of the officers involved but has declined to say who his client is. Officers told witness Floyd resisted arrest Police said they arrested Floyd Monday after responding to the forgery call and finding him inside a car. Police said he “physically resisted” after he got out of the vehicle. Surveillance video obtained from a nearby restaurant shows some of the officers’ initial contact with him and doesn’t appear to show obvious resistance from a handcuffed Floyd. Eventually Floyd is escorted away from view. Donald Williams, a witness, told CNN he was about to walk into a store when he noticed commotion. He said he saw Floyd “panting for his life, begging for his forgiveness.” Williams’ description of events matches a video captured by one bystander in which Floyd can be heard calling for help, saying, “I can’t breathe,” and that his body was hurting. Williams said he tried to approach an officer and ask what was happening. Officers said Floyd was “resisting arrest.” “I said, ‘Officer, he’s not resisting arrest, you have your knee on him and you have handcuffs on him, he’s detained at this moment,'” he said. One officer responded by saying “this is what drugs do to you,” according to Williams. Floyd was declared dead at a nearby hospital a short time later. A medics team that responded to the incident worked on an “unresponsive, pulseless male,” according to a Minneapolis Fire Department narrative released by police. Minneapolis police have not yet released bodycam footage from the officers involved.",0.0
1619509562,2020-05-28 15:59:57,Becoming a homemade scientist,https://byuiscroll.org/becoming-a-homemade-scientist/,en,False,,660126,Scroll,http://www.byuicomm.net/,"As billions of people are stuck inside because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, some have been able to pursue their passions, others try new hobbies, and some have their minds fill with curiosity. A way to satisfy curiosity can be with science experiments. Here are eight great science experiments you can try at home with everyday items. 1. Homemade lava lamp Materials: A clear cup filled with 1/2 an inch or 1 centimeter of water 5 drops of your favorite color of food coloring 1/2 a cup of vegetable oil 1/2 an Alka-Seltzer tablet Instructions: In the cup, mix together the drops of food coloring with the water. In the cup, pour oil slowly, making sure the oil and water do not mix. Add the Alka-Seltzer. As the Alka-Seltzer mixes with the water, bubbles start to rise through the oil. While the bubbles rise to the top and pop, the density of the water makes it fall back to the bottom. For smaller sized bubbles, crush the Alka-Seltzer into pieces. To view the experiment check this video: How To Make a DIY Lava Lamp With Alka-Seltzer 2. Aluminum can crush Materials: Soda can filled with 1 tablespoon or 15 milliliters of water A frying pan A bowl filled with ice water Tongs Instructions: Place aluminum can in the middle of the frying pan. Place pan on the stove at high heat until vapor comes out of the top. Place ice water on the counter next to the frying pan. Grab the can with the tongs and quickly place it into the ice water with the open end down. As the hot can is quickly cooled, the air pressure inside the can becomes lower than the atmospheric pressure outside. Both pressures naturally want to be equal, which causes the can to implode. To view the experiment check this video: Hot Can VS Cold Water Quick Science Experiment 3. Fire snake Materials: 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of baking soda 3 tablespoons or 45 grams of sugar A small cup for mixing A bowl filled with 1 cup or 128 grams of sand Lighter Lighter fluid Instructions: In the small cup, mix baking soda and sugar together. Squirt the top layer of sand with lighter fluid. Place baking soda and sugar mixture on top of the sand. Light the sand on fire using a lighter. When the baking soda gets hot, it makes carbon dioxide gas. The pressure from this gas pushes the carbonate from the burning sugar out of the sand, making the black snake. To view the experiment check this video: Fire Snake Experiment WARNING: The fire can burn for a long time and the bowl will be hot after the fire is out. 4. Sharpie can opener Materials: An unopened soda can Sharpie marker Instructions: Place the can on a sturdy surface. Place the Sharpie on the inside edge by the opening of the can. Apply medium pressure to the can with the marker and slide it along the edge of the can by the opening As you rub the Sharpie along the aluminum, it weakens the metal. As the metal begins to weaken, the seal of the tab fails and the pressure from inside the can forces the tab upwards. To keep it from making a big mess, use a chilled can of soda. To view the experiment check this video: Physics Demo Time – Opening a Can Drink with a Sharpie! 5. Orange peel balloon pop Materials: Peeled skin of an orange Inflatable balloon Instructions: Inflate the balloon to roughly the size of your head. Squeeze a piece of orange peel near the balloon with the outside of the peel facing the balloon. Inside an orange peel is the chemical called limonene. The limonene weakens the rubber of the balloon causing it to pop. In order to get a good amount of limonene to come out, fold the orange peel in half but do not cut the skin. After that, rub the pieces of orange peel together making a rolling motion with the crease of the peel. To view the experiment check this video: How to Pop Balloons with Orange Peels! ~ With Explanation 6. Disappearing Coke Materials: A clear cup 1 cup or 250 milliliters of Coke 1/4 cup or 60 milliliters of bleach Instructions: Fill the cup with Coke. Fill the rest of the cup with bleach. Stir solution every 1-2 minutes. As you stir the solution, the color will slowly begin to change. When the bleach interacts with the Coke molecules, it breaks up the alternating bonds and turns the coke into a clear liquid. To view the experiment check this video: Bleach vs Coke – Science Experiment WARNING: The fumes from the bleach can be very strong, do not put your face over top of the cup. 7. Rainbow Paper Materials: Black construction paper Clear nail polish protector 8×6 baking sheet or casserole dish 1 towel Instructions: Fill the baking sheet with 1/2 inch or 1 centimeter high with water. Fully submerge the black construction paper in the water. Let one drop of clear nail polish drip on top of the water. Wait 5-10 seconds. Lift the paper out of the water. Place paper on the towel to dry. As the nail polish sits in the water, it creates a film on the surface. When you pull the paper out of the water the film will stick to the paper. When the paper dries out, a rainbow pattern will appear. To view the experiment check this video: DIY Rainbow Paper 8. Floating Ball Materials: Lightweight inflated ball Leaf blower Instructions: Position leaf blower so the air blows straight up. Begin to blow air and hold the ball in the air stream. Slowly let go of the ball until it is floating in the stream. As the air travels around the ball, the air speeds up. This increase in speed creates a lower pressure on top of the ball and keeps it in the air stream. Having faster air flow will result in more control of the ball. To view the experiment check this video: Bernoulli’s Principle Demonstration: Bernoulli’s Ball Each experiment should take five minutes but can be tweaked to have a different outcome.

1620247140,2020-05-29 06:13:00,Cliven Bundy Armed Standoff Case Going Back To Court,https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/cliven-bundy-armed-standoff-case-going-back-court,en,False,,138019,boisestatepublicradio.org,http://boisestatepublicradio.org/,"It's been more than two years since Cliven Bundy left the federal courthouse in downtown Las Vegas a free man. His arm around his wife, Carol Bundy, the Nevada rancher was defiant. ""We're not done with this,"" Bundy told reporters in January 2018. ""If the federal government comes after us again we will definitely tell 'em the truth."" On Friday, the Justice Department will try to come after the Bundys again, when federal prosecutors will appeal for a retrial over a 2014 armed standoff between Bundy, his militia and federal agents who had come to round up the rancher's cows that were illegally grazing on federal land. The government's case against Cliven Bundy, his sons, Ammon and Ryan and a Montana militiaman named Ryan Payne, collapsed after a judge declared a mistrial in December 2017. Bundy and his men were accused of conspiracy against federal agents and other charges for their role in the tense standoff which later became a symbol over the fight against federal control of public lands. ""If there is no successful prosecution, it's going to encourage a lot of anarchists like the Bundys to take actions that not only are a threat to themselves but threats to the public at large,"" said Pat Shea, who served as BLM director during the Clinton administration. Retrial effort criticized For their part, the Bundys and their supporters appear puzzled that the federal government is even pursuing a retrial. ""What's really ironic and frankly I think disgusting is that the Trump Justice Department is the one that allowed the U.S. attorney in Nevada to take the appeal,"" said Larry Klayman, Cliven Bundy's attorney. After all, President Trump recently pardoned two Oregon ranchers whose fight with federal land managers inspired Cliven Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, to lead a separate, armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016. Federal prosecutors mostly failed to get convictions in that Oregon case and have been widely criticized for bungling the Nevada trial. Judge Gloria Navarro dismissed the case and later declared a mistrial after ruling federal prosecutors ""deliberately misled"" defense attorneys and the court by failing to provide evidence from surveillance cameras and to disclose the existence of federal snipers near the ranch in the days leading up to the April 2014 standoff. The U.S. attorney's office in Nevada declined an interview request by NPR. But court filings indicate prosecutors will likely argue Friday that their missteps in the 2017 trial were ""inadvertent,"" and in particular they say they were trying to balance disclosing Bureau of Land Management surveillance footage with protecting witnesses against violence. Klayman, who is himself a controversial conservative activist and was once fixture in the ""Birther"" movement, says the DOJ is being hypocritical. He says the investigation against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was recently dropped, but not his clients. ""If you're one of the Washington elite and establishment in the nation's capital, you get special treatment,"" Klayman said. ""If you're Cliven Bundy and his sons and the peaceful protesters, basically you don't."" Most of the federal agents and land managers who were at the 2014 standoff say it was anything but a peaceful protest. Photos and social media posts showed militia training their rifles on armed BLM officers who had come to round up Bundy's cattle. Cliven Bundy has refused to recognize the federal government's ownership of millions of acres of public land — including in Nevada. The rancher has consequently not paid federal fees owed for grazing his cows on land near the Lake Mead National Recreation Area since the 1990s. Pandemic ""resuscitates"" movement Retired federal land managers like Pat Shea have expressed outrage over the government's continued failure to prosecute the Bundys, whose cows continue to graze — for free — on land that's now protected as a national monument. The Bundys' original dispute over grazing goes back decades, stemming from tensions between ranchers and environmentalists and the city of Las Vegas, as it began rapidly expanding into a protected desert tortoise's habitat. Bundy was seen as the last rancher in southern Nevada who refused to get out of the business. But in the years since, his critics say the family's fight has devolved into far right extremism, and a widely debunked legal theory that counties and states, not the federal government, should own public land. ""It's like the COVID-19 virus, they mutate as to their belief system so much that you can never tell what they're going to advocate,"" Shea said. ""They are a danger to themselves and a danger to everyone else they come in contact with."" Indeed, the pandemic has lately brought an opportunity to breathe new life to the Bundys and their self-described patriot movement that had been seen as starting to fade. Ammon Bundy and some of the family's followers have been traveling across the West leading protests against coronavirus public health restrictions, protests that thus far haven't drawn huge numbers. At one recent march in Washington state that was streamed on Facebook, activist Kelli Stewart decried the business closures: ""Come on guys, this is the American way, open rebellion to tyrannical laws, we're not slaves."" A rebellious fight against tyranny, or justice against a family that has flaunted the law for decades, that's a question now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The court takes up the appeal for a retrial in USA vs. Bundy in a virtual session on Friday. ",0.0
1620247044,2020-05-29 10:11:00,Minneapolis Seethes Over George Floyd's Death As Trump Calls Protesters 'THUGS',https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/minneapolis-seethes-over-george-floyds-death-trump-calls-protesters-thugs,en,False,,138019,boisestatepublicradio.org,http://boisestatepublicradio.org/,"Updated at 10:56 p.m. ET Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer involved in George Floyd's death on Monday, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced the charges Friday, shortly after Chauvin was taken into custody by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The announcement comes days after the release of a video that shows Chauvin's knee pressed firmly on the black man's neck for at least seven minutes. That video has inspired outrage nationwide and unrest in Minneapolis and had led to Chauvin's firing as well as that of three other officers seen in the video. Asked why Chauvin wasn't arrested earlier — something demanded by protesters and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — Freeman said his office moved as quickly as possible in its investigation. He added that the three other former officers remain under investigation and that he anticipates charges for them, too. The Department of Justice is also conducting an investigation on ""a separate and parallel track,"" U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Friday in a statement. ""Both state and federal officers are working diligently and collaboratively to ensure that any available evidence relevant to these decisions is obtained as quickly as possible,"" Barr said. Those investigations, coupled with the officers' firings, has so far failed to satisfy the protesters who had gathered for a third night Thursday in Minneapolis. Some of them stormed the 3rd Police Precinct, the closest precinct to the site of Floyd's arrest, setting fire to that building after police withdrew in an attempt to mitigate tensions. Rioters burned and looted other buildings in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The region has seethed since the release of the video depicting Floyd's arrest, which shows Floyd crying for help before falling silent, while bystanders shout that he's dying. The officer did not remove his knee until paramedics showed up to move Floyd's unresponsive body into an ambulance. He was reported dead later Monday night. In an attempt to avoid another night of chaos, officials ordered a nighttime curfew in Minneapolis and St. Paul beginning at 8 p.m. local time Friday and Saturday nights and continuing until 6 a.m., although the curfew was widely ignored. Here is the latest on the situation: Floyd's family: ""We want a first-degree murder charge"" Floyd's family said that prosecutors have made ""a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice,"" in a statement issued shortly after the announcement that Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. But they feel that authorities haven't gone far enough. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested. We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer,"" the family said in a statement shared by their attorney. In Minnesota, a third-degree murder conviction can result in up to 25 years in prison, while murder in the first degree brings a possible life sentence. ""The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw,"" the family added, ""and is spilling out onto streets across America."" Gov. Tim Walz: ""I understand clearly there is no trust"" During a news conference Friday morning, the Minnesota governor acknowledged the pain of those outraged by Floyd's death in police custody — whose name he added to a list of ""unheard"" black men killed by police, including Philando Castile, who was shot in 2016 by police in a suburb of St. Paul. ""The very tools that we need to use to get control to make sure that buildings aren't burned and the rule of law doesn't collapse are those very institutional tools that have led to that grief and pain. I understand clearly there is no trust in many of our communities,"" Walz told reporters. ""But I'm asking you to help us use humane ways to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice, so that those that are expressing rage and anger and demanding justice are heard."" President Trump's tweet about ""THUGS"" flagged for glorifying violence The president, who called Floyd's death ""very sad and tragic"" earlier this week, said early Friday that he had told Minnesota's governor that ""the Military is with him all the way."" He also described the source of the unrest as ""THUGS"" — a word widely criticized for bearing racial overtones. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" he continued in a tweet partially hidden and flagged by Twitter for violating its policy against ""glorifying violence."" Trump did not miss the social network's decision. Not long after the move, the president — who signed an executive order Thursday aimed at limiting the legal protections afforded to social media companies such as Twitter — took aim at the company with a tweet saying it ""will be regulated."" Trump later sought to clarify his initial tweet, saying that shooting simply can occur when looting gets out of hand. ""It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,"" Trump explained in a pair of tweets. ""It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media."" In a tweet of his own, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said he is ""furious"" that Trump ""is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many."" Gov. Walz apologizes for brief arrest of CNN crew On Friday morning, state police arrested a CNN crew while it was reporting about the unrest on live television: ""A black reporter from CNN was arrested while legally covering the protests in Minneapolis,"" the network pointedly noted. ""A white reporter also on the ground was not."" The crew of correspondent Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez was released about an hour later, and Walz repeatedly apologized during his news conference Friday. ""A few minutes after hearing [about the arrest] I was on a call with CNN President Jeff Zucker, who demanded to know what happened. I take full responsibility,"" Walz said Friday. ""There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen. Calls were made immediately. This is a very public apology to that team. It should not happen."" The swift backtrack did little to soften the shock of the spectacle, though. ""With all the perversions of American democracy that we have witnessed, few rival the dystopian spectacle of a U.S. journalist calmly reporting the news and repeatedly offering to reposition his crew at the police's request, only to be arrested, cuffed and hauled away alongside his crew,"" said Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America, advocacy group that fights for press freedom. She added: ""For us at PEN America, where we routinely document the arrest and imprisonment of writers and journalists worldwide, the action was eerily familiar, but something we expect to see in authoritarian states: Turkey, Hong Kong, Egypt. To see it in the United States of America is appalling."" Obama and others nationwide respond to Floyd's death Demonstrators in Minneapolis are not alone in their outrage over Floyd's death. Activists spilled onto city streets across the country, holding protests seeking justice for the Minneapolis man as well as other unarmed black men and women who have died at the hands of law enforcement officers or in police custody. Large protests were held outside the White House and outside the CNN headquarters in Atlanta, as well as in cities including New York, Houston and San Jose, Calif. Among those who took to social media to express their pain and frustration Friday was former President Barack Obama. ""It's natural to wish for life 'to just get back to normal' as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly 'normal' – whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park,"" Obama said in a statement posted to social media. In speaking of jogging and bird-watching, the former president referred to two other videos that have inspired outrage this month — one in which a black man was followed and killed by two white men while out for a run in Georgia, and another in which a white woman called police on a black bird-watcher in New York City after he asked her to leash her dog. ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" Obama said. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" My statement on the death of George Floyd: pic.twitter.com/Hg1k9JHT6R — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 29, 2020 Protesters have turned out to express their outrage as far as Los Angeles and New York City. Meanwhile in Louisville, Ky., demonstrators gathered Thursday to protest death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot by police during a no-knock raid on her home in March. Those protests turned violent, as well, with several people reported shot amid the melee. As one protester in Minneapolis told NPR, the anger over Floyd's death is about more than just one man — it's about how police treat black people across the U.S. ""This is how our people react, you know? When we've been done wrong for so long,"" he said. ""So, me, I'm just praying and hoping everybody makes it home safe."" NPR's Adrian Florido contributed to this report. ",0.0
1620335236,2020-05-29 08:39:26,Evacuated Minneapolis police precinct set ablaze by rioters protesting George Floyd’s death,https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/05/evacuated-minneapolis-police-precinct-set-ablaze-by-crowds-protesting-george-floyds-death/,en,False,,247820,eastidahonews.com,http://eastidahonews.com/,"(CNN) — State police in body armor and riot gear lined up Friday morning near the Minneapolis police precinct that was set ablaze by protesters overnight following the death of an unarmed black man this week in city officers’ custody. Donning protective helmets with face shields and carrying batons, they stood near the site littered with debris after a night of confrontations and sprayed mace at protesters who got too close. They responded by throwing projectiles at the officers as others fled. Fires raged overnight in Minneapolis as crowds shattered windows and charged over a fence to get access to 3rd Police Precinct. They chanted George Floyd’s name and “I can’t breathe,” marching past buildings engulfed in smoke and orange flames. Others tossed fireworks toward the precinct, which is closest to where Floyd was captured on video with an officer kneeling on his neck Monday before he died. Before state police arrived, the precinct was deserted after officers were evacuated Thursday. A CNN crew has been released from police custody after they were arrested Friday during a live broadcast at the site after clearly identifying themselves to officers. CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez was placed in handcuffs while the cameras rolled, shortly followed by producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez. From New York City to Denver and other cities, protesters demanded justice for Floyd, including next door in St. Paul, Minnesota, where more than 170 businesses were damaged or looted, the city’s police department said early Friday. Seven people were shot in Louisville, Kentucky, during overnight protests over a separate case, the death of an EMT during a March police encounter. Large crowds gathered in communities across the country, even as experts warned people to continue to avoid big gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. 500 National Guard soldiers arrive More than 500 Minnesota National Guard personnel mobilized to several locations in the Minneapolis area, including banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. “Our mission is to protect life, preserve property and the right to peacefully demonstrate,” the Minnesota National Guard tweeted. “A key objective is to ensure fire departments are able to respond to calls.” City officials warned protesters Thursday night to leave the precinct area, saying it may be in danger of exploding due to “unconfirmed reports” of severed gas lines. “If you are near the building, for your safety, PLEASE RETREAT in the event the building explodes,” a tweet on the city’s account said. The Minneapolis Police Department said it had evacuated staff from the precinct for safety reasons. Authorities had set up a fence around it, but protesters pushed it over, officials said. Outrage grows to other cities Floyd was arrested after he allegedly used a counterfeit bill at a convenience store. Surveillance video from outside a Minneapolis restaurant appears to contradict police claims that he resisted arrest. Outrage grew after a video surfaced showing a Minneapolis officer kneeling on his neck during the arrest. Floyd was unarmed and handcuffed, and cried that he couldn’t breathe before he later died. The four officers involved in the arrest have been fired but not charged, angering protesters. They gathered in several other cities — New York, Denver, Phoenix, Memphis and Columbus, Ohio — to demand their prosecution. St. Paul’s mayor said the protesters’ anger was understandable, calling the video of Floyd’s death “nauseating.” “It’s heartbreaking for everybody I know … everybody I know looks at that video and feels like crying or throwing up, and it’s disgusting, it’s unacceptable,” Mayor Melvin Carter said. He acknowledged that the community was unhappy with the rioting and looting, but said there was a broader root problem that needed addressing. “In order to get to the bottom of this, we have to understand where the rage is coming from in the first place,” he said. “As we all know, we’ve seen video after video … we’ve seen that the people responsible go free. And it seems no one gets held accountable.” Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock pleaded with people to demonstrate peacefully. “You can be angry. You can be outraged. I certainly am and I join you in those feelings and demands of #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd,” he tweeted. “March for justice and to see it served, but please march in peace.” The Minneapolis mayor criticized violent incidents. “What we’ve seen over the past several hours and the past couple of nights in terms of looting is unacceptable,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told reporters. “Our communities cannot and will not tolerate it.” About 70 people were arrested Thursday in New York, said New York Police Department Detective Adam Navarro, as crowds gathered near Union Square to protest Floyd’s death. Charges range from obstruction of governmental administration to criminal possession of a weapon after a woman pulled a switchblade at Union Square, a law enforcement official said. Police chief apologizes Local and federal officials have not announced any charges against the Minneapolis officers. But they said Thursday that the investigation is a top priority. “We need to wade through all of that evidence and come to a meaningful decision and we are doing that to the best of our ability,” Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman said. “We are going to investigate it as expeditiously, as thoroughly as justice demands,” he added. “That video is graphic, horrific and terrible … I am pleading with individuals to remain calm and let us conduct this investigation.” All four officers involved in the death have invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Freeman said. The House Judiciary Committee urged the Justice Department to investigate, saying the federal government has a critical role to play in ensuring accountability for law enforcement organizations. The officer seen with his knee on Floyd’s neck had 18 prior complaints filed against him with the Minneapolis Police Department’s Internal Affairs. It’s unclear what the internal affairs complaints against Derek Chauvin were for. Officials did not provide additional details. But Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized, saying he understands the role his department has played in the chaos. “I am absolutely sorry for the pain, devastation and trauma Mr. Floyd’s death has left on his family, his loved ones, Minneapolis and the world,” Arradondo said. “I know there is currently a deficit of hope in our city … and I know our department has contributed to that deficit as a whole.” The victim’s brother, Philonise Floyd, asked people to remain calm despite their pain and anger. Meanwhile, in a late night tweet, President Donald Trump described the Minneapolis protesters as “thugs,” and threatened to send the National Guard. “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said. Twitter added a warning label to his tweet for “glorifying violence.” The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.",0.0
1620335232,2020-05-29 08:56:40,TV crew released from police custody after they were arrested live on air in Minneapolis,https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/05/tv-crew-released-from-police-custody-after-they-were-arrested-live-on-air-in-minneapolis/,en,False,,247820,eastidahonews.com,http://eastidahonews.com/,"(CNN) — A CNN crew was arrested while giving a live television report Friday morning in Minneapolis — and then released about an hour later — as the crew covered ongoing protests over the death in police custody of George Floyd. State police detained CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez, his producer and his cameraman shortly after 5 a.m. CT (6 a.m. ET) as Jimenez was reporting live from a street south of downtown, near where a police precinct was earlier set ablaze. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker that he deeply apologizes for what happened and would work to have the crew released. Jimenez and the others — producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez — were taken to the city’s downtown public safety building, but were released after 6 a.m. CT. Jimenez, after his release, then reported live outside from downtown, and said he’d been treated cordially after he’d been led away. “We’re doing OK, now. There were a few uneasy moments there,” Jimenez said. The arrest The crew were handcuffed and detained as Jimenez gave a live report on a Minneapolis street. A line of state troopers had just recently arrived in the area, which city police seemed to have abandoned for hours overnight after the police precinct building was set on fire. Police told the crew they were being detained because they were told to move, and didn’t, one member of the CNN crew relayed to the network. “A CNN reporter and his production team were arrested this morning in Minneapolis for doing their jobs, despite identifying themselves — a clear violation of their First Amendment rights. The authorities in Minnesota, including the Governor, must release the three CNN employees immediately,” CNN said in a statement shortly after their arrest. Officers approached the crew as they moved in to arrest a protester behind them. Jimenez could be seen holding his CNN badge while reporting, identifying himself as a reporter, and telling the officers the crew would move wherever officers needed them to. An officer gripped his arm as Jimenez talked, then put him in handcuffs. “We can move back to where you like. We are live on the air here. … Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way — wherever you want us (we’ll) get out of your way,” Jimenez said before he was led away. “We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection,” Jimenez said. After the CNN photographer was arrested, his camera was set on the ground and continued to transmit live images. Jimenez and the crew had been reporting from the site, near a city police department precinct that protesters had burned and officers had abandoned overnight. About a block away, a fire was burning at a different, four-story building that had contained restaurants. Over 100 state police officers in body armor and riot gear had arrived shortly before 5 a.m. CT and lined up near the area where the CNN crew was, near the precinct building on East Lake Street. For a portion of time overnight — from sometime after city police abandoned the precinct building that was set ablaze — police weren’t in the area until the troopers arrived Friday morning, Jimenez had reported. The four-story event and restaurant building was burning unabated, and people were throwing things into the flames, Jimenez said. A separate CNN reporter there was not arrested and ‘treated much differently‘ CNN’s Josh Campell, who also was in the area but not standing with the on-air crew, said he, too, was approached by police, but was allowed to remain. “I identified myself … they said, ‘OK, you’re permitted to be in the area,'” recounted Campbell, who is white. “I was treated much differently than (Jimenez) was.” Jimenez is black and Latino. Former Philadelphia police commissioner Charles Ramsey, a CNN law enforcement analyst, said the arrest made no sense. “State police are going to have a lot to answer for this arrest here,” Ramsey said. “(Jimenez is) standing there … you can see his credential. Just move him where you want to be.” “They should have a designated (media) area, and just tell them to move to that area.” The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin is charged with third degree murder, but they are continuing to review evidence and there may be subsequent charges later. The manslaughter charge is second degree. Freeman said they focused on the ""most dangerous"" perpetrator first, but the other three officers involved in Floyd's arrest are under investigation and he anticipates charges against them as well. The criminal complaint states that Chauvin was the officer seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck while Floyd was pleading, ""I can't breathe."" ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer,"" Freeman said, referring to the video as ""horrible, horrific, terrible."" He said that in addition to that bystander video, they have officers' body-worn cameras, witness statements, the preliminary Medical Examiner's report, and expert opinions as evidence. ""Normally these cases take nine months to a year,"" Freeman said. ""We have to charge these cases very carefully because we have the difficult burden of proof."" When asked whether public unrest factored into the speed, Freeman said, ""I’m not insensitive to what’s happened in the streets."" But he maintained that his job is to charge when his office has ""sufficient evidence."" ""I will not allow us to charge a case before it is ready,"" Freeman said. ""This case is now ready, and we have charged it."" Freeman said that the charges are the same ones levied against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond. According to the criminal complaint in the Floyd case, two officers responded to a report of someone using a counterfeit $20 bill at the Cup Foods on 37th and Chicago Avenue. Officers Thomas Lane and J.A. Kueng were told the man was sitting in a car parked around the corner, on 38th Street. The complaint says Lane began speaking with Floyd, who was in the driver's seat of the car, and then pulled his gun and told Floyd to show his hands. When Floyd put his hands on the steering wheel, Lane put his gun back. According to the complaint, Lane ordered Floyd out of the car, then pulled him out and handcuffed him. Floyd ""actively resisted being handcuffed,"" but then became compliant and sat on the sidewalk at Lane's direction. The attorney's office says in the complaint that Floyd and Lang had a conversation for just under two minutes, and then both officers stood Floyd up and tried to walk him to their squad. At that point, the charges state that Floyd ""stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic."" That's when officers Derek Chauvin and Tou Thoa arrived as backup. They made ""several attempts"" to get Floyd into the backseat of the car and ""Floyd did not voluntarily get in the car and struggled with the officers by intentionally falling down, saying he was not going int the car, and refusing to stand still,"" the complaint says. According to the complaint, Floyd said he could not breathe while he was standing up, and began repeating it. The complaint says officers tried to get Floyd into the car from the passenger side, and and at 8:19 p.m. Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the car. ""Mr. Floyd went to the ground face down and still handcuffed,"" the complaint narrative then reads. ""Kueng held Mr. Floyd’s back and Lane held his legs. The defendant placed his left knee in the area of Mr. Floyd’s head and neck. Mr. Floyd said, 'I can’t breathe' multiple times and repeatedly said, 'Mama' and 'please,' as well. The defendant and the other two officers stayed in their positions."" According to the complaint, the officers told Floyd, ""you are talking fine."" Lane asked if they should roll him on his side, and Chauvin said, ""No, staying put where we got him."" The complaint says that Lane asked again, ""I am worried about excited delirium or whatever,"" and Chauvin said, ""That's why we have him on his stomach."" ""None of the three officers moved from their positions,"" the complaint says. The body-worn camera footage investigators examined showed that Floyd stopped moving at 8:24:24, and stopped breathing or speaking at 8:25:31. Kueng checked Floyd's wrist for a pulse and said ""I couldn't find one,"" but none of the officers moved until 8:27:24, when Chauvin removed his knee from Floyd's neck, according to the complaint. The autopsy report is pending but preliminary findings show that Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. ""The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death,"" the report says, with no evidence of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation. Prosecutors ended the criminal complaint by saying, ""The defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive. Police are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" In a letter to Gov. Walz Friday afternoon, the Minneapolis Delegation requested that the case be handled by the Attorney General's Office rather than the Hennepin County Attorney. The letter, which was written in collaboration by Representatives Fue Lee (59A), Raymond Dehn (59B), Sydney Jordan (60A), Mohamud Noor (60B), Frank Hornstein (61A), Jamie Long (61B), Hodan Hassan (62A), Aisha Gomez (62B), Jim Davnie (63A), Jean Wagenius (63B), reads: We are writing to request that the case against the police officers who killed George Floyd, or may have been otherwise culpable in his death, be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Attorney General's office. Unfortunately, our constituents, especially constituents of color, have lost faith in the ability of Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to fairly and impartially investigate and prosecute these cases. Freeman's press conference on May 28th, in which he seemed ill-prepared and suggested that there was unseen exculpatory evidence that might exonerate the officers, further ruptured this trust. Given the present circumstances, we believe that this case should be handled in a way that maximizes public trust and gives confidence to the public that justice will be done. Under the circumstances, transferring the case to the Attorney General's office would be one of the most decisive actions that you could take to calm public anger and guarantee a fair process. Attorney General Ellison has earned goodwill of Minneapolis residents through years of service to the city, and is known and respected throughout the community. It is imperative to signal to our constituents, as strongly and quickly as possible, that the authorities are treating this case with the special attention it deserves, and to demonstrate that all Minnesotans are equal in the eyes of the law. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey issued a statement in response to the charges Friday, saying, ""We are a nation at a crossroad, and today’s decision from the County Attorney is an essential first step on a longer road toward justice and healing our city."" “What’s happened in Minneapolis is bigger than any one city and any single event,” said Frey. “For our Black community who have, for centuries, been forced to endure injustice in a world simply unwilling to correct or acknowledge it: I know that whatever hope you feel today is tempered with skepticism and a righteous outrage."" Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington announced earlier Friday during a different news conference that Chauvin had been arrested. The BCA confirms that he was taken into custody at 11:44 a.m. Friday in Minneapolis. Meanwhile, Governor Tim Walz held a news conference at 10:30 a.m. after another night of violence and looting in Minneapolis and St. Paul, as protests over the death of George Floyd devolved into riots. Walz said he received a call from State Sen. Patricia Torres Ray Thursday that District 63 was burning, and there were no police officers or Minnesota National Guard troops to help. “That is an abject failure that cannot happen,"" Walz said. ""We must restore that order.” Harrington said that national guard troops were called in to help Thursday, but they did not receive a “specific mission” to help clear the streets until midnight, on a call with the mayor. Harrington said Minneapolis Mayor Frey informed them they had ""no more resources"" and they were not able to meet public safety needs on Lake Street. ""When the Third Precinct was abandoned, it seemed that that was the time to move,"" Gov. Walz said. They then had to get a plan together, Harrington said. By the time they brought state patrol, Minnesota National Guard, and other assisting crews to Lake Street, he said it was 3 a.m. They arrested some people at that time and for other looting incidents throughout the day, Harrington said, but he did not have numbers on how many. He said most people left peacefully. Harrington said the people who were out at that hour were not the people of Minneapolis “who are still having their guts ripped out about the Floyd murder.” “I don’t want to prejudice this,” he said regarding using the term “murder.” “I’m just calling it like I see it.” “I can tell you that no one could have heard Mr. Floyd’s voice in the chaos of the screaming and the shouting and the fires at 1 o’clock in the morning on Lake Street,” he said. “My job is to make sure the community is safe and the team is ready and prepared to keep it safe.” Harrington said his team, including the national guard, state troopers and DNR, is confident that they can make a plan to keep people safe Friday night while protecting First Amendment rights to protest. “We will create a plan that will keep the peace, maintain the peace, and prevent further lawless behavior in the city of Minneapolis, the city of St. Paul and surrounding suburbs,” he said. The governor acknowledged that the ""tools"" needed to restore order, including the Minnesota National Guard, are ""the very same tools that have led to that grief and pain."" Those national guard troops are armed, officials confirmed Friday, and maintain the right to defend themselves, though they would not comment further on the boundaries around their use of force. ""I’m asking you to help us. Help us use a humane way to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice,"" he said. ""So those who are demanding justice can be heard. Not those who throw fire bombs into businesses."" Walz said that he has spoken with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman and he is confident that ""justice will be swift, that it will come in a timely manner, and that it will be fair."" ""You're seeing holes in planning,"" Walz said, ""that's for dang sure."" He said Minnesotans can expect to hear what the plan is for Friday night by 2 p.m. ""Tonight needs to be different,"" Walz said. He promised that state troops would step into the gap. State Attorney General Keith Ellison quoted Martin Luther King, Jr., when he asked Minnesotans not to disregard riots as only senseless violence. ""Ask yourself, what’s going on there?"" he said. ""And is it something that we as a society absolutely must pay attention to? I think we must pay attention."" Ellison pointed out that as Minnesota National Guard troops are deployed to maintain order, they are the same people who were administering COVID-19 tests across the state last week. ""Don’t react to them the way you might react to the Minneapolis Police Department,"" he said. ""It’s not the same group. They have different leadership, different authority, and their job is to try to bring peace and calm back again. Please remember that this is not the group you associate with unfair conduct."" Walz said Friday that he believes the public has ""lost faith"" in the Minneapolis Police Department. The state's response came as businesses and homes continued to burn Thursday night and Friday morning. Just after 10:30 p.m., a crowd stormed the building housing the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct, setting it on fire. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey held a press conference just after 1 a.m. to address the continued unrest across the city. Frey said rioting posed an imminent threat to the safety of the officers and staffers within MPD's Third Precinct, forcing him to make the decision to evacuate the compound. “Symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life or the public,” Frey said. “We could not risk serious injury to anyone… brick and mortar is not as important as life.” However, he went on to say that progress during this crisis would not come from the government alone. “We additionally need help from the community. We need to make sure that people are looking out for our city right now. It's not just enough to do the right thing for yourself. We need to make sure that all of us are upholding the ideals that we stand by.” Although the mayor acknowledged the pain and frustration in recent days, he made it clear, the devastation is unacceptable. “What we have seen over the past couple of nights in terms of looting is unacceptable. These are businesses. These are community institutions that we need. These are banks that people rely on to get cash, grocery stores that people rely on to get food … We need to ensure that they are protected.” In St. Paul, fires burned in buildings across the street from Allianz Field. According to a post from the Saint Paul Police Department, more than 170 businesses have been damaged or looted along with dozens of fires. President Trump also weighed in on Twitter late Thursday night, blaming the emergent social disturbance on a lack of local leadership, and threatened to send in the federal National Guard unless the city was brought under control. The president went on to tweet, ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"" Twitter has since removed a portion of the president's tweet, citing violations of their user policy for glorifying violence.",0.0

Floyd's death has sparked days of protests in Minneapolis. President Trump blamed the unrest on ""thugs"" in a tweet that was later hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" Read Obama's full statement below, including a reference to a viral video of a song by Keedron Bryant, who pleads, ""I just want to live, God protect me."" I want to share parts of the conversations I've had with friends over the past couple days about the footage of George Floyd dying face down on the street under the knee of a police officer in Minnesota. The first is an email from a middle-aged African American businessman. ""Dude I gotta tell you the George Floyd incident in Minnesota hurt. I cried when I saw that video. It broke me down. The 'knee on the neck' is a metaphor for how the system so cavalierly holds black folks down, ignoring the cries for help. People don't care. Truly tragic."" Another friend of mine used the powerful song that went viral from 12-year-old Keedron Bryant to describe the frustrations he was feeling. The circumstances of my friend and Keedron may be different, but their anguish is the same. It's shared by me and millions of others. It's natural to wish for life ""to just get back to normal"" as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly ""normal"" — whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park. This shouldn't be ""normal"" in 2020 America. It can't be ""normal."" If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better. It will fall mainly on the officials of Minnesota to ensure that the circumstances surrounding George Floyd's death are investigated thoroughly and that justice is ultimately done. But it falls on all of us, regardless of our race or station — including the majority of men and women in law enforcement who take pride in doing their tough job the right way, every day — to work together to create a ""new normal"" in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.

SPOKANE, Wash. — Spokane Police Chief Craig Meidl is weighing in on the in-custody death of George Floyd and its impact on the Spokane community. This comes as large protests erupt nationwide and in Spokane over Floyd's death. Floyd was killed in policy custody in Minneapolis on Monday night following an arrest. He was pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis police officer who had his knee on Floyd's neck. Bystander video captured Floyd repeatedly saying, ""I can't breathe,"" before his death. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Three other officers have also been fired. The Spokane Police Department took on a major effort in 2013 to improve the way they police the city in response to the death of Otto Zehm. Zehm, who was diagnosed with a mental disability, died after an altercation with police in 2006. Former Police Officer Karl Thompson was convicted in 2012 by a federal jury for using excessive force and lying to investigators about Zehm’s death. In response to Floyd's death, Meidl said his department emphasizes that officers use force ""because we have to, not because we can."" “We are held to a higher standard, and we know that when we take the job, so it's important that they do understand [that] people do expect better from us,"" Meidl said. Meidl also reacted to watching the video of Floyd's arrest during an interview with KREM's Whitney Ward. “...As I started watching it, I got a pit in my stomach because you know how it ends. As you're seeing the events unfold, you want to just yell across time and tell them, ‘Don't do this. don't do that. Get off of him. Turn him on his side,'"" Meidl said. ""You're sitting there and you have that helpless feeling, so you can only imagine how helpless those bystanders felt, or how helpless a lot of the African American community felt because they experiencing it at a level that we just can't,"" he added. Through conversations with black communities in Spokane, Meidl said he has a better grasp on how Floyd's death more than 1,000 miles away has a profound impact on people at the local level. ""To them, it feels like it happened in their own neighborhood, their own friend or family member. So it was important to me to touch base with them, to reach out and let them know we support you, we stand with you, and we are here for you if you need us,"" he said. Pullman Police Chief Gary Jenkins also reacted to Floyd's death, writing in a statement that everyone within his department and those throughout the country ""should be disgusted by what has occurred in Minneapolis."" ""Not only are we disgusted by the actions of the officer directly responsible for the death of Mr. Floyd, but also by the lack of intervention by the other officers who, by simply standing by, were complicit in his death. Those who are complicit in incidents like this must also be held accountable,"" Jenkins wrote. He also addressed those in the Pullman community who are supporters of police and may have ""conflicted feelings"" about how to react to the video of Floyd's death. ""In many instances, more context is needed in order to effectively judge police conduct shown on video, but this is not one of those instances. You can support the police without supporting the actions of these officers,"" Jenkins wrote. ""Police brutality is not law enforcement. Any officer who abuses their power, or who stands by and allows it to happen, does not deserve to wear the badge,"" he added. Read Jenkins' full statement below: Spokane NAACP releases statement In a statement, the Spokane NAACP called for accountability among the courts and members of the law enforcement community. “We ask again, when will enough be enough in allowing this culture of bias, racism, hatred and unchecked law enforcement violence to exist? How long will the courts, the political system and the justice system continue to ratify this racist and inhumane behavior of those members of our human family who have supposedly sworn to protect all of us?” the statement reads in part. NAACP leaders added that people of color have cried out against injustice ""for far too long.""",0.0

Demonstrators funneled their anguish in cities like Atlanta, New York and Washington into chants, signs and outbreaks of violence, smashing windows and setting vehicles ablaze. In Minneapolis, shop owners and citizens cleaned up damaged lots and protesters took a knee for Floyd while others marched on an interstate. Hundreds of people gathered at the stadium for the city’s NFL team, the Vikings. In one of the most chaotic protests Atlanta has seen in years, demonstrators smashed windows of police cars outside CNN Center, which houses Precinct 5 of the Atlanta Police Department. At least one squad car was set on fire. Police in riot gear helped other force protesters back to Centennial Olympic Park. Earlier in the day, hundreds of people had peacefully marched a few miles to the Georgia Capitol and back to the park. Latest developments • Minneapolis and St. Paul are under a curfew instituted after days of protests marked by looting and arson. • In Washington, DC, a protest outside the White House briefly caused the building to be placed on lockdown. It has since been lifted and the Secret Service has reopened entrances and exits to the White House campus for both staff and media. • In New York, protesters and police clashed in various incidents Friday night outside the Barclays Center with protestors throwing water bottles, what appeared to be a bottle of paint and more at police officers. At least 12 people were arrested, police said. • In Houston, demonstrators carried signs that said, “End police brutality” and “Black lives matter.” • Protests also took place in Dallas; Las Vegas; Los Angeles; Charlotte, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia, and San Jose, California. Floyd’s family is angry about the charges On Friday, Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman charged Derek Chauvin, fired Minneapolis police officer seen in a video with his knee on Floyd’s neck, with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Floyd’s family and their attorney, Benjamin Crump, are upset that Chauvin wasn’t charged with a more serious offense. “We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,” Crump and the family said in a statement. “We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer.” Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds in total, and 2 minutes, 53 seconds after Floyd was unresponsive, according to a criminal complaint filed Friday. The Minneapolis curfew began at 8 p.m. CT on Friday and last until Saturday at 6 a.m. The curfew will be in effect for Saturday evening as well, according to an emergency resolution signed by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. The neighboring city of St. Paul imposed a similar curfew for Friday beginning at 8 p.m. CT, according to St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter. Chauvin and three other officers detained Floyd in handcuffs Monday after he allegedly used a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, police have said. Outrage grew in the form of protests after a video surfaced showing a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck. The 46-year-old, who was unarmed, cried out that he couldn’t breathe. Freeman said charges against the other three officers are likely. “We entrust our police officers to use certain amounts of force to do their job to protect us. They commit a criminal act if they use this force unreasonably,” he said. The criminal complaint says, “Derek Michael Chauvin caused the death of George Floyd by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind without regard for human life.” If convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, Chauvin would face up to 25 years in prison on the first charge and up to 10 years on the second. The evidence in the case includes a cell phone video of the incident, body worn cameras, witness statements, a preliminary report from medical examiner, and discussions with an expert, Freeman said. Complaint says death was from several factors The preliminary autopsy report found “no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,” according to the criminal complaint released by the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office. The report added: “The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.” Read the criminal complaint CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta cautioned that the absence of physical evidence doesn’t necessarily mean Floyd didn’t die from asphyxiation. Gupta also said that an officer should have started CPR after one of them told the others he couldn’t find a pulse. Chauvin was arrested and taken into custody Friday by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, according to Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington. CNN has reached out to Chauvin’s attorney and the Minneapolis police union for comment. Tensions boil over in Minneapolis Overnight, the Minneapolis Police Department’s Third Precinct was set ablaze. Some protesters chanted Floyd’s name and “I can’t breathe,” and some tossed fireworks toward the precinct, which is the one closest to where the incident was captured on video. State police, donning protective gear and carrying batons, lined up Friday morning near the site littered with debris and sprayed mace at protesters who got too close. Some responded by throwing projectiles at the officers as others fled. Meantime, a CNN crew was released from police custody in Minneapolis after they were arrested Friday during a live broadcast at the site after clearly identifying themselves to officers. CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez was placed in handcuffs while the cameras rolled, shortly followed by producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez. The state patrol said the crew was “released once they were confirmed to be members of the media.” CNN disputed that characterization, saying, “Our CNN crew identified themselves, on live television, immediately as journalists.” “We’re doing OK, now,” Jimenez said, reporting again from downtown. “There were a few uneasy moments there.” The Minneapolis Police Department said it evacuated staff from the Third Precinct for safety reasons. Authorities had set up a fence around it, but protesters pushed it over, officials said. City officials warned protesters Thursday night to leave the precinct area, saying it may be in danger of exploding due to “unconfirmed reports” of severed gas lines. More than 500 Minnesota National Guard personnel mobilized to several locations in the Minneapolis area, including banks, grocery stories and pharmacies. Another community organizer, Shanene Herbert, told CNN Thursday before the night’s events that young people had “every right to be angry.” “They have experienced trauma,” she said. “Seeing your friends, your families and even yourself harassed by the police and killed by the police, it’s traumatic. And they don’t know what to do with that.” The Minneapolis mayor criticized the violent incidents. “What we’ve seen over the past several hours and the past couple of nights in terms of looting is unacceptable,” Frey told reporters. “Our communities cannot and will not tolerate it.” The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after pleading for help as a former Minneapolis police officer used his knee on Floyd’s neck to pin him — unarmed and handcuffed — to the ground for nearly nine minutes. The incident began after Floyd allegedly tried to pay for something with a counterfeit bill. Video of the death has sparked outrage, protests and even riots across the country on Wednesday and Thursday, and the protests continued Friday. The Idaho Falls demonstration was organized by the Bonneville County Democratic Party.People who attended brought signs that read, “Black Lives Matter” and “Stop Killing Black People.” Brandon Grimsley, EastIdahoNews.com “The Bonneville County Democratic Party has always been in favor of equal rights for all,” Chairwoman Pat Tucker said. “We are not seeing the right to life equally applied to black men. We want to make the point unequivocally that here in Idaho Falls, we care about each and every life.” Tucker said the rally was held to raise awareness about institutional racism in the United States. She hopes to work with local law enforcement to combat institutional racism even here in eastern Idaho. “What happened to George Floyd cannot happen again,” she said. “It was murder for a nonviolent crime. Officers need to respond with minimal force.” Brandon Grimsley, EastIdahoNews.com Derek Chauvin, the fired Minneapolis police officer seen in a video with his knee on Floyd’s neck, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter on Friday.

DENVER — Demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd marched through Denver on Thursday, at times blocking an interstate, as well as major thoroughfares through downtown. A cell phone video, which has been shared widely across the country, shows a driver moving through one group walking on Broadway near Colfax Avenue and apparently intentionally hitting a protester. The video starts with a shot of the crowd and shows a man hanging on the car. It's not clear what happened before the video starts, but according to the Twitter user who posted the video, the man jumped on the vehicle just before she began filming. Another witness who took pictures of the moments just before the incident said they were crossing the street when the driver approached with her window down, shouting at protesters. The man jumps off the car after a few moments. After, the driver quickly swerves and heads directly for the man, who was hit by the front right end of the vehicle. He falls the ground just after someone yells to him saying to “watch out.” The man did not appear to be seriously hurt. The driver quickly pulled away, followed by a crowd of the demonstrators. The Denver Police Department (DPD) said Friday they were aware of the video but had not yet identified either the driver of the vehicle or the man who was hit. They asked anyone with information about either person to contact police or Metro Denver Crime Stoppers at 720-913-7867. “Tonight is a very sad night for our state. While we are still uncovering all of the facts about what took place, a protest regarding the killing of George Floyd devolved into vandalism and violence, and I was absolutely shocked by video evidence of a motorist attempting to run over a protestor,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement late Thursday night. “Coloradans are better than this. I share the immense anguish we all feel about the unjust murder of George Floyd. But let me be clear, senseless violence will never be healed by more violence.” The incident was a brief moment in the hours of chaos that unfolded in Denver. The protest began peacefully but later in the night, graffiti was left on the Colorado capitol walls and windows were broken out of cars in the parking lot. One group of protesters briefly walked onto Interstate 25, blocking the highway traffic. Several city streets were shut down by protesters, as well. To manage the crowds, the Denver Police Department (DPD) used a variety of non-lethal rounds like pepper balls, flash-bangs and tear gas. People were seen running through the clouds of smoke and standing with their hands up near the capitol. Mayor Michael Hancock urged peaceful protests more than once as the night continued: “Like all of you, I am outraged at the senseless death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. His life matters and Denver has joined the chorus of those across the country demanding change and reform and consequences. And yes, we will protest loudly and make our voices heard. But we must not turn on one another. We must stand united. The men and women of the Denver Police Department are not the enemy. For the last three months as we have weathered the storm of this terrible pandemic, they have put their lives at great risk protecting all of us. The road to recovery is before us, and all of us – black, Latino, Asian, white – all of us must recover together. That doesn’t mean we stand silent when injustice occurs – whether in Minneapolis or in Georgia or in our nation’s capital. We do not stand silent. We move, we act, and with respect, we create change – together. “More than ever, we need to all pull together, because we can remake this world together, guided by equity and tolerance and justice.”",0.0

""It was not enough,"" Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — ""an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,"" according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. ""We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,"" the governor said Saturday. ""But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life."" The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd's death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order ""to help keep peace in Louisville."" ""I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,"" Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. ""But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe."" President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd's memory is for authorities to ""get tougher"" on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called ""radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can't do this."" ""They've got to be tough, they've got to be smart,"" Trump said of state officials. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military."" In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump's comments, saying that though the outrage is ""real and legitimate,"" the protests are ""being hijacked by violent radical elements."" ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,"" Barr said. ""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.""

1621109134,2020-05-30 11:47:10,Minnesota governor says destruction no longer about George Floyd and he’ll mobilize full National Guard,https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/05/minnesota-governor-says-destruction-no-longer-about-george-floyd-and-hell-mobilize-full-national-guard/,en,False,,247820,eastidahonews.com,http://eastidahonews.com/,"(CNN) — Minnesota’s governor said Saturday he will move to “fully mobilize the National Guard” after destructive Minneapolis-area protests that he says are “no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd.” “Last night (was) a mockery of pretending this about George Floyd’s death or inequities,” Gov. Tim Walz said in a news conference. He asserted unrest has become about outsiders — largely not Minnesotans — “attacking civil society (and) instilling fear.” Walz’s comments came the day after a breathtaking night of protests, fires and riots in cities across the country, sparked in part by Monday’s death of Floyd, an unarmed and handcuffed 46-year-old black man, while in Minneapolis police custody. Walz and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul said vandals are largely nonresidents of the cities with no interest in Floyd’s death. The state’s “communities of color … were out fighting hand in hand,” he said, to try to save businesses, some that took generations to build, that were under attack. “Nothing we do to provide justice” for Floyd “matter(s) to any of these people who are out here firing upon the National Guard, burning” businesses and “disrupting civil life,” Walz said. “Will not accept George Floyd’s death. We will not accept the destruction of our communities, either,” St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said. Anger boiled over Friday in more than 30 cities, with some protesters smashing windows, setting vehicles ablaze, blocking traffic on highways and clashing with police. In Minneapolis, where an officer seen on video with his knee on Floyd’s neck was arrested Friday, some protesters knelt under a bridge and prayed. Others tossed rocks at officers who fired rubber bullets in return. At a protest in Detroit, one person was shot dead. And in Springfield, Massachusetts, hundreds gathered peacefully. “If you can tell me something better for me to do — if you can tell me a way that we could change the world without trying to make noise like that, then I’ll get out of the streets,” Max Bailey, 22, said at the protests in Denver. A nation cooped up for weeks over coronavirus restrictions and suffering from resulting job losses now sees throngs of people demonstrating in streets, unloading a powder keg of emotion in part over the recent deaths of Floyd and other unarmed black Americans. In Oakland, California, one Federal Protective Service officer was killed and other injured Friday in a shooting at the downtown federal building during protests in the city, police said. Details about what led to the shooting weren’t immediately available. Live updates: Protests spread nationwide Key developments • Teen shot: Detroit police could not confirm whether the 19-year-old killed was part of the protests, but they said the shooting happened downtown where the rallies were taking place. A police captain was struck with a rock during the protests. • More soldiers: This will be the first full mobilization of Minnesota’s National Guard since World War II, Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen said. The governor spoke with US Defense Secretary Mark Esper to inquire about possible federal assistance, Walz said Saturday. A defense official with knowledge of current planning told CNN that Walz has said he didn’t need federal troops at this point. • Clashes and arrests: In New York, 12 people were arrested as protesters and police clashed outside the Barclays Center. Protesters threw water bottles at police officers. • Pleas for peace: In Dallas, Mayor Eric Johnson implored people destroying property to stop. “I understand the outrage, and I feel this pain deeply,” Johnson said. “What happened in Minneapolis is unacceptable. But please, remain peaceful.” • Officers injured: Two police officers were injured during protests in Los Angeles. The LAPD declared downtown protests an unlawful assembly and said anyone who disobeys the order will be arrested. • Hundreds of arrests: In Houston, nearly 200 people were arrested and most will be charged with obstructing a roadway, according to the Police Department. It also said four of its officers suffered minor injuries. • Mayor speaks: Portland police dispersed protesters with tear gas, saying there was property damage, looting and arson to buildings and vehicles. “Enough,” Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted. Protests across the nation Though protesters called out similar chants for justice, the demonstrations played out differently in each city. The epicenter of the demonstrations was Minneapolis, where officers stood on top of a precinct armed with nonlethal deterrents as a man in the crowd of protesters tried to climb the gate. When fires moved from the precinct to dumpsters and residential streets, more than 350 troops were deployed to control the groups. Minneapolis and St. Paul were under a curfew after looting and arson broke out during days of protests. But hundreds took to the streets as police fired tear gas and protesters hid behind cars. The Twin Cities will have over 1,700 National Guard soldiers this weekend, officials said. “It’s about time this police brutality has to stop. I don’t agree with breaking into all of the businesses, but I can understand the outrage after REPEATED incidents,” Mackenzie Slagle said of protests in Oakland. “Because I’m a white woman, and I needed to show up for all my brothers and sisters.” In Atlanta, a day of protests began peacefully but turned when a crowd set fire to a police car and smashed the windows of a defaced CNN Center. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he’ll activate National Guard troops “to protect people and property in Atlanta. “What I see happening on the streets of Atlanta is not Atlanta. This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr. This is chaos,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said. “Killer” was scrawled across a beaten police car in Los Angeles where protesters lined up along a freeway to block traffic. At least two officers were injured over the course of the night, said the LAPD. In Washington, the White House was briefly locked down Friday as protesters moved toward it. For hours overnight, protesters confronted officers, including those from the Secret Service, throwing bottles at them, removing metal barriers and pushing against officers’ riot shields. Officers responded at least once by spraying pepper spray. In San Jose, California, protesters blocked a highway and smashed windows of at least one stopped vehicle, video from CNN affiliate KGO shows. Demonstrators also stopped traffic on an Interstate 43 ramp in Milwaukee, CNN affiliate WISN reported. Protesters in Boston chanted, “Who do you protect? Who do you serve?” Friday outside a police precinct building. Bail is set for the officer arrested The bail for Derek Chauvin, the former officer charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, was set at $500,000. Chauvin, who is white, and three other officers detained Floyd, who was black, in handcuffs Monday after he allegedly used a counterfeit bill at a convenience store. Outrage grew after a video surfaced showing Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck. Floyd, 46, was unarmed and cried out that he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for a total of 8 minutes, 46 seconds, according to a criminal complaint filed Friday. Charges against the other three officers are likely, authorities said. All four officers were fired this week, after Floyd’s death. Floyd’s family is upset that Chauvin wasn’t charged with a more serious offense, their attorney Benjamin Crump said. “We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,” the family said in a statement. If convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, Chauvin faces 25 years in prison on the first charge and up to 10 years on the second. Chauvin’s wife has filed for divorce, according to a statement on her behalf by a Minneapolis law firm. Video shows 3 officers kneeling on George Floyd New video posted on social media, meanwhile, appears to show three Minneapolis police officers — not just Chauvin — kneeling on George Floyd during his arrest. CNN has not been able to locate the person who shot the footage. The new video shows the other side of the Minneapolis police vehicle — the side opposite shown in initially shared images. “I can’t breathe, man,” Floyd can be heard saying in the new video. “Please, let me stand. Please, man.” Minneapolis police had said Floyd “physically resisted” the officers. Surveillance footage from a nearby restaurant does not appear to support the claim that he resisted arrest during the initial encounter. However, there are several minutes when Floyd’s and the officers’ interactions cannot be seen from that camera’s vantage point. The new video showing three officers apparently kneeling on Floyd seems to have been taken some time after the restaurant surveillance video. Autopsy lists several factors A preliminary autopsy said the combined effects of Floyd being restrained, potential intoxicants in his system and underlying health issues, including heart disease, contributed to his death. It said there was no physical findings to support strangulation as the cause of death. Read the criminal complaint The absence of physical evidence doesn’t necessarily mean Floyd didn’t die from asphyxiation, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta cautioned. Gupta also said an officer should have started CPR after one of them told the others he couldn’t find a pulse. CNN has reached out to the former officer’s attorney and the Minneapolis police union for comment. The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.",0.0

Some of the strongest condemnations came from other law enforcement officers who noted how unnecessary the tactics used by the former Minnesota police officers were in apprehending and restraining Floyd. RELATED | Minneapolis ex-officer who knelt on George Floyd’s neck is in custody and charged with murder The Madison County Sheriff’s Office reached out to EastIdahoNews.com to show us how to take down and place someone into handcuffs quickly and nearly painlessly. They also showed us how to get a suspect into a patrol car. “It can be done,” sheriff office spokesman Sgt. Isaac Payne said. “It takes consistent and correct training, though.” In addition to his job at the sheriff’s office, Payne also owns a martial arts gym in Rexburg and has demonstrated combat techniques on national television. Payne said that in Idaho, law enforcement officers use certain procedures and grappling techniques mostly derived from Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. “We focus on ground control and ground movement,” Payne said. “There are strikes in the system, but we try to use that as little as possible. The objective is always control, always de-escalation.” Payne said when faced with a combative suspect, there are varying levels of force that can be applied. Just having a law enforcement officer’s presence is the first level. Deputy Colin Selin recounts a situation where he arrived at a domestic disturbance call and found a young man wanting to fight him. Selin said the first thing they do is try to talk to the suspect and calm them down. But in this situation, talks failed, and he was required to use his training. “When it came down to it he gestured, made some threats, so I went hands-on with him,” Selin said. Sgt. Isaac Payne shows step by step the proper arrest techniques | Brandon Grimsley, EastIdahoNews.com Selin used the grappling techniques to bring the man to the ground, place him into handcuffs, and sit him up to wait for backup — in a very short amount of time. “It’s really important when you cuff somebody up to get them into a position where they can breathe,” Selin said. “It’s not really wise, and it’s not in our policy to leave people on their bellies.” Payne said like in the situation involving the death of Floyd, placing a knee on someone’s neck is not the best method of control. “I would be very hypercritical of any agency that approved that technique,” Payne said. While it is the responsibility of law enforcement to maintain the safety of others, sometimes bumps and bruises happen when a suspect begins to fight, Payne said, but in general, injuries are minor. “In any situation like that is rapidly evolving, constantly moving, accidents are going to happen, bumps and scrapes happen,” Payne said. “It’s a different situation when it’s intentional and malicious. … Maybe a bump or a bruise that happened as we fell to the ground — well, that’s explainable.” Although suspects may fight back on occasion, both Payne and Selin agree that an untrained person in combative has about two minutes at best to fight back. “After that they are tired, they are exhausted, they have no fight left in them,” Payne said. Thankfully, Payne said, most people who are arrested are compliant and listen to deputies’ commands. “We don’t want to go hands-on unless we have to,” Payne said. In any situation, Selin and Payne said it’s best to use communication skills and remember everyone you are interacting with is still a person. “They might have done something wrong, but we have just as much responsibility to take care of and protect them as anybody else,” Payne said.

As the day wore on, protesters vandalized stores, burned vehicles and threw objects; by the end of the day, protesters and officers were injured and many protesters were in police custody. After a citywide curfew went into effect, law enforcement officers from across northern Utah gathered near the Salt Lake City Library, armed with shields and batons, formed lines across from the protesters and began moving forward to disperse crowds. Rows of police officers advanced south on 200 East toward protesters about 10 p.m., firing rubber bullets to try to disperse those remaining few who were hurling objects toward police. By 10:45 p.m. most of the crowds had been dispersed, and officers were loading the last few detainees onto a Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office bus. All this, hours after state and city leaders ordered an emergency curfew for the city which began at 8 p.m. and will last until Monday at 6 a.m. Gov. Gary Herbert also tweeted that he “activated the National Guard to help control the escalating situation in downtown Salt Lake City. I once again call on all who are protesting to do so peacefully.” Many of those downtown Saturday were mourning something. Some of the responding officers came from the Ogden Police Department days after mourning one of their own killed in the line of duty. Similarly, the original stated purpose of the protest was for those mourning the death of George Floyd while in police custody. Downtown after curfew A tense, chaotic scene unfolded as police officers walked forward, announcing “This is an unlawful assembly, go home!” with loudspeakers. Stacked lines of police officers advanced, shoulder to shoulder, carrying shields, batons and rubber bullet guns, with armored vehicles behind them. As officers moved forward, motorcycles revved, people chanted “Hands up, don’t shoot!” and some protesters threw items. Protesters threw glass bottles, weapons and signs, but while officers continued to quickly advance intermittently, they refrained from rushing the crowd. There were reports that one officer suffered a broken arm, and Salt Lake Police Chief Mike Brown said another officer was attacked by a baseball bat and suffered head injuries. Several protesters were also hurt, many by people throwing rocks, bottles and other items. Later, rocks were thrown over a reporter’s head and rubber bullets were fired into the crowd. “Stop shooting! Stop shooting! You shot me in the face!” a protester screamed behind the reporter. As the numbers were being reduced, there were scattered “pops” and smoke bombs. “Leave the area, go home, quit throwing things, it’s not safe, it’s not a peaceful protest. You have been given a lawful command to disperse,” officers announced. Utah Highway Patrol Col. Michael Rapich told KSL that “the dispersal order was continually repeated for one hour” in multiple languages before officers began taking the remaining protesters into custody. Most dispersed at that point, he said, but “there were a few that chose not to; they were taken into custody without incident.” He said officers would enforce the curfew Salt Lake City has put in place until 6 a.m. Monday. “Hopefully that curfew gives everyone a pause” before continuing acts of vandalism, he said, adding the First Amendment is what Utah is about, but the platform of damaging state property is not what Utah is about. Carter Williams, KSL.com Protests take a turn The peaceful protests took a turn about 3 p.m. Saturday afternoon at the corner of 200 East and 400 South when people overturned a police car and set it on fire. The vehicle’s windows were shattered, and before the fire was set, some members of the crowd were standing on top of the car dancing and waving signs; others in the crowd denounced such actions. Meanwhile, a couple of armed men stood at one street corner, saying they were protecting protesters. At least one of these men was wearing a Hawaiian shirt, an outfit commonly associated with the far-right Boogaloo movement. “It’s definitely starting to get out of hand here in Salt Lake City,” KSL TV’s Alex Cabrero said in a Facebook Live video. Things settled down for a bit, but then around 5 p.m. people began to once again target police vehicles near 200 East and 400 South, hitting one police car with a skateboard several times. This was in the same area where a patrol vehicle was overturned and lit on fire earlier in the afternoon. Carter Williams, KSL.com KSL.com reporters in the area saw two armored police vehicles arrive in the area, followed by 20-30 patrol cars from various agencies across the Salt Lake Valley. Police in riot gear got out and started yelling at protesters to leave. As of 6:30 p.m., the National Guard had arrived on scene. It was unclear at that point who on the scene of the protest was related to the original protest and who had come in from outside groups. From then on, the action came in waves, with some protesters throwing objects at police lines, injuring a few officers. Some protesters appeared to be injured in the scuffles as well, and at least a couple of people were taken into custody. Another car was set on fire later in the evening and a man taken into police custody after witnesses say he showed a knife and a bow and arrow in the midst of a group of protesters. Carter Williams, KSL.com A witness said the man drove up near a crowd of protesters at 200 East and 400 South. The witness said the man got out of the vehicle with a large knife attached to his side and pulled out a bow and arrow and attempted to shoot someone. KSL TV cameras were rolling as protesters tackled the man to the ground. Police officers in the area pulled the man from the crowd and took him into custody. Shortly thereafter, a black vehicle which some witnesses said belonged to the man with the bow and arrow was flipped over by protesters and lit on fire. The area was crowded with protesters and armored police officers attempting to keep the crowds away from the burning vehicle. Carter Williams, KSL.com Later, the man was again seen among the crowd. Police said he was no longer in custody, but they intend to screen charges against him. Morning protests Utah organizers planned events Saturday with the intent to peacefully honor George Floyd’s death. The black Minnesota man died in police custody after white police officer kneeled on his neck earlier this week. The morning event was intended to be an in-car protest only, organized by Utah Against Police Brutality. Protesters were asked to drive by in their vehicles and honk at the public safety building as they circled the block. Hundreds of protesters on foot circled the Salt Lake City Library several times before filling the sidewalks in front of the Salt Lake City Police Department public safety building, holding signs reading “Justice for George,” “White Silence” and “Stop Police Brutality.” Protesters gather in front of the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building on Saturday, May 30, 2020, a part of a nationwide call for justice following the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man from South Minneapolis who died after a white police officer pressed a knee to his neck for more than eight minutes. | Katie Workman, KSL.com Aaron Campbell, a man who said he has experience with protests, said he came out to help keep people safe. He said he attempted to organize on-foot protesters in groups of 20 to obey social distancing requirements, but they were “swarmed by a large group of about a hundred.” Protesters with loudspeakers led chants such as: “This is what democracy looks like!” “Black Lives Matter” and “I can’t breathe.” Protesters cheered and raised signs amid the ruckus, still backed by constant honking and the revving of motorcycles. As chants continued, two protesters scaled the entryway of the precinct and spray painted the building with the words “George Floyd,” “(expletive) da police” and “Enough is Enough,” among other things. Passing cars honked in support, and many of their windows were painted with protest slogans or posters. Egg shells and food remained littered the steps after the protesters left, and tomatoes and empty egg cartons were discovered nearby. On Saturday, May 30, 2020, protesters tagged the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building with graffiti calling for justice in the death of George Floyd, a black man from South Minneapolis who died in an altercation with a white police officer. | Katie Workman, KSL.com Campbell said a man on a Harley Davidson motorcycle helped break up the protest in front of the police building when he slowly drove through the crowd and encouraged organizers to continue walking. Many obeyed the suggestion and much of the crowd dispersed, though smaller groups remained on street corners and in front of the building. Construction signs, local bus stations and the Utah Transit Authority’s Library Station were also vandalized. Capitol protesters Protests continued in the early afternoon at the Utah State Capitol Building, where hundreds gathered on the steps and peaceful continued chants. Some protesters passed out water and others scaled light posts. A rainbow LGBTQ+ pride flag billowed in the wind in front of the building, and passing motorcyclists continued to rev their engines to cheers. Additional graffiti reading “Blue lives murder” and “No justice, no peace,” among others, covered areas of the steps and grounds. Graffiti was also found on the Capitol’s front windows, much of it painted in red. Protest signs were also taped to the windows. Hundreds knelt on the front steps with fists in the air in tribute of George Floyd, and a protester with a loudspeaker gave a brief speech denouncing police brutality and encouraging protesters to remain active because “showing up is not enough” to end injustice. In the evening, officers lined up at the Capitol steps, preventing protesters from entering the building. The message law enforcement tried to communicate was that everyone has the right to gather and protest, but they were there to make sure the situation didn’t turn violent. About an hour after curfew, Utah Highway Patrol troopers were ready to enforce the curfew at the Capitol, and most protesters were leaving. Troopers were heard on loudspeakers telling the roughly two-dozen remaining protesters to disperse and were advancing their line to encourage protesters to leave. As of 10 p.m., at least two people had somehow made their way inside the Capitol and were peering out through a window. UHP is tasked with protecting the Utah State Capitol building, which was vandalized, but no one illegally breached the Capitol, Rapich said. And damage at the Capitol would be repaired quickly, he said. “Our Capitol is a symbol of our entire state.” Local NAACP reaction In comments to KSL Saturday night, Jeanetta Williams, president of the NAACP Salt Lake Branch, said the organization does not condone the destruction that has happened during the protests in Salt Lake City. “We do realize the frustration that people have been feeling but the violence in the protests is not something we want to see,” Williams said. “There’s better ways to do it than to do the type of violence that we’ve been seeing. … This protest is not a badge of honor whatsoever. We want folks to not fuel tension.” The NAACP does not condone protesters hitting and throwing objects at officers or anyone else, or vandalism, she said. “Those are things we are very disheartened about,” Williams said. “It does a discredit to the work that we’ve done as a nonprofit civil rights organization” and she invited people to join their cause to “do some good but not do the violence.” Contributing: Jacob Klopfenstein, KSL.com; Alex Cabrero, Garna Mejia, Mike Headrick and Shara Park, KSL TV",0.0

PORTLAND, Ore. — Portland's mayor Ted Wheeler has declared a state of emergency for Portland after riots damaged numerous businesses and public buildings Friday night and into Saturday morning. The mayor also enacted a curfew that begins Saturday night at 8 p.m. and continues until 6 a.m. Sunday morning. The curfew means all travel is prohibited on public streets or in public places in Portland during those hours. TriMet said buses and MAX trains will run Saturday night for those who must take essential trips, but service may end quickly if downtown Portland or another part of the city becomes unsafe. Thousands of people marched from North Portland's Peninsula Park, down Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Northeast Portland, before heading over the Burnside Bridge to downtown Portland's Justice Center. Along the way, businesses and property in Northeast Portland, and then across downtown, were heavily damaged as police and protesters violently clashed again and again. Numerous store windows were broken, and fires were set inside multiple locations, including the Justice Center. Portland police say as of 5 a.m. Saturday, 13 people were arrested, and two officers suffered minor injuries. Mayor Wheeler, along with Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, representatives of Portland Police and Fire bureaus, along with pastors, held a news conference Saturday morning. ""I cannot condone last night's violence, I can't stand by and watch our city be destroyed, buildings set aflame. I won't. But nor will I stand silent as men like George Floyd are murdered by the very institutions that are supposed to protect and serve them,"" Wheeler said. ""Institutions fail and deny [black people] their basic rights and, all too often, even their very lives ... the murder of George Floyd underscored the day to day experience of being black in America."" Commissioner Hardesty said she believes a small group of people is responsible for the damage that occurred. ""I believe there was a small group of people who came out last night with every intention of tearing stuff up, and they were going to tear it up no matter what,"" Hardesty said. ""What happened last night had nothing to do with black America. it was not about standing up for black people's rights. It wasn't about acknowledging death and harm. It was small group of people who thought - this is a good opportunity to steal and break stuff."" She added the COVID-19 pandemic has already had a staggering and painful effect on unemployment in the Portland area, and last night's violence and damage only made that worse. ""Thanks to some stupidity last night we can add thousands of more people to the unemployment list,"" Hardesty said. Portland Fire Chief Sara Boone also spoke about her experience as a black woman. “When we talk about trauma, when we talk about fear, when we talk about no one is there to protect us... that’s what black people feel every single day,"" Chief Boone said. SATURDAY NIGHT CURFEW The curfew means all travel is prohibited on public streets or in public places in Portland during those hours. Those who have to travel to or from work are exempt, as are anyone seeking emergency medical care, fleeing a dangerous situation, or experiencing homelessness. Travel applies to all modes, including but not limited to; foot, bicycle, car and public transit.",0.0

Curfews for several cities in western Washington expired Monday morning. Seattle’s mandatory citywide curfew expired at 5 a.m. Monday after violent downtown protests on Saturday that started as a peaceful rally over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. There were no reports of violence on Saturday in Bellevue, however, looters made their way to downtown on Sunday. The city issued an emergency curfew that was in effect from 5:30 p.m. on Sunday to 5:30 a.m. Monday, June 1. Bellevue also requested the support of the National Guard. Tukwila was under a curfew from 9 p.m. Sunday to 6 a.m. Monday after looters broke into stores at Southcenter and threw rocks and projectiles at officers. Auburn enacted a curfew from 11 p.m. through 7 a.m. Monday in response to looting at several retail locations. Renton enacted a curfew Sunday night that expired at 5 a.m. Monday. On Saturday in Seattle, crowds were ordered to evacuate the downtown corridor immediately when the curfew was first imposed. Several Seattle police and city transit vehicles were set on fire, along with the property damage and looting of dozens of downtown businesses. Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said at least 55 people were arrested “for a variety of offenses from assault, to arson, to destruction and looting.” Gov. Jay Inslee activated up to 200 members of the Washington National Guard to help the city of Seattle. Guard personnel will be unarmed and work under the direction of Seattle city leadership. Inslee's Chief of Staff David Postman said this is the first time the National Guard has been called into Seattle since the WTO Riots in 1999. Washington State Ferries closed Colman Dock amid the curfew orders. Both directions of I-5 through downtown Seattle were also shut down for several hours on Saturday and Sunday after demonstrators entered the freeway. Emergency alerts were sent to cell phones across the region from the city's Office of Emergency Management. Seattle police said people in the crowd threw fireworks towards people attending Saturday's rally and injured citizens and officers. Mayor Durkan spoke about the violence and her curfew orders shortly after 6 p.m. Saturday. ""The escalated incidents of destruction and violence do not honor Mr. Floyd."" Durkan emphasized that George Floyd's family has condemned the destructive protests that have been happening across the country this week. The violent demonstrations ""cannot and will not be allowed to continue,"" Durkan said. A woman who attended a peaceful rally Saturday morning told KING 5 she is furious that other people not involved in the peaceful protest became destructive. ""They hijacked our protest... I am furious,"" she said. ""It has totally taken away from what we came down here to do."" Governor Jay Inslee issued a statement regarding the protests Saturday afternoon, saying he respects the right of all to gather peacefully but that destruction would not be tolerated. ""As people gather today to protest the unjust death of George Floyd, I hope they do so peacefully and safely. Everyone has the freedom - and the right - to demonstrate and speak their mind. However, violence and destruction have no place in Washington state or our country. Together, we grieve for the death of George Floyd, and many, many others. The events in Minnesota and across the nation the past few nights have been stunning and illustrate how inequity causes people to lose faith in their public institutions. The trauma inflicted on generations of people of color must be acknowledged, and more must be done to correct it. Feeling second-class in one’s own community does not make people feel safe. Insecurity hardens into anger. I fully support the right to free speech and peaceful assembly.

1621314788,2020-05-31 00:52:03,Protesters break curfew on another night of fury and frustrations over George Floyd’s killing,https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/05/protesters-break-curfew-on-another-night-of-fury-and-frustrations-over-george-floyds-killing/,en,False,,247820,eastidahonews.com,http://eastidahonews.com/,"(CNN) — Protests over the death of George Floyd raged from coast to coast — with crowds breaking curfew in major cities on another night of fury and frustrations. Fires burned and and tear gas canisters flew in Minneapolis. In Seattle, smoke filled the air as police in riot gear lined the streets. And in Philadelphia, officers chased a group of people down the streets for violating curfew. The National Guard dispatched to Washington, DC, to assist police handling protests around the White House, authorities said. At least 25 cities have imposed curfews and numerous states activated National Guard forces in anticipation of another night of protests, sparked in part by the death of Floyd — who was unarmed and handcuffed — while in Minneapolis police custody. The former officer seen in a video kneeling on Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged. Protesters are demanding the arrest of three other officers at the scene. Live updates: Protests spread nationwide Latest developments • City curfews: A curfew is underway in cities like Atlanta, Philadelphia and Milwaukee until Sunday morning. Mayors in cities like Denver, Cincinnati, Louisville and Salt Lake City imposed evening curfews that will expire Monday morning. • National Guard: At least six states and the District of Columbia have either activated or requested assistance from the National Guard, including Minnesota, Georgia, Ohio, Colorado, and Kentucky. • 21-year-old shot: A young man was killed Friday night in downtown Detroit where protests were taking place. Police had previously said the victim was 19 and that they could not confirm whether the victim was part of the protests. • Clashes and arrests: More than 500 people were arrested in Friday night’s protests in Los Angeles, police said. New York City police have made more than 200 arrests connected to protests, and more than a dozen officers have been seriously hurt, according to a senior NYPD source. In Houston, nearly 200 people were arrested and most will be charged with obstructing a roadway, police said. • Pleas for peace: In Dallas, Mayor Eric Johnson implored people destroying property to stop. In Portland, Oregon, police dispersed protesters with tear gas, saying there was extensive property damage. “Enough,” Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted. Minnesota officials say outsiders are hijacking protests State and local authorities said the violence in Minneapolis was being fueled by outsiders. “Nothing we do to provide justice” for Floyd “matter(s) to any of these people who are out here firing upon the National Guard, burning” businesses and “disrupting civil life,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told reporters on Saturday. The governor said he understands that “Minnesotans’ … inability to deal with inequality” and racism was the catalyst for the protests — but he said rough estimates indicate only 20% of protesters there are Minnesotans. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said everyone arrested in his city on Friday night was from out of state. A CNN analysis of data from the Hennepin County Sheriff’s office showed that more than 80% of those booked into jail on riot and other potentially riot-related charges over the last two days were from Minnesota. Of the 51 people booked into jail between noon Thursday and noon Saturday on riot, unlawful assembly, burglary or damage to property charges, a total of 43 had an address listed in Minnesota, the data showed. The data only covers people booked into jail, not necessarily all arrests. Hennepin County includes Minneapolis, but not St. Paul. John Harrington, the state public safety commissioner, said that assertions about outside agitators come partly from arrest data as well as information from fliers and online postings. Officials did not provide further details about who exactly was fueling the unrest and where they were from. Harrington said he hoped to release more information later Saturday. US Attorney General William Barr said the “voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements” pursuing “their own separate and violent agenda.” Without citing evidence, the attorney general said that in many places “it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchic and left extremist groups, far-left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom traveled from outside the state to promote the violence.” A Justice Department spokeswoman later said the information underpinning Barr’s assertion came from state and local law enforcement. Vandalism in Los Angeles and Chicago Protests were underway Saturday in cities like Chicago, Baltimore, Los Angeles and Washington, DC, where several Secret Service vehicles were vandalized with graffiti outside the White House. A demonstration in Los Angeles led to clashes between police and protesters. Police vehicles were vandalized in Los Angeles by some protesters who kicked in the windows or sprayed the cars with graffiti. Police fired rubber bullets at demonstrators, who chanted “Black Lives Matter” and “George Floyd.” Aerial footage from CNN affiliate WLS showed protesters in Chicago vandalizing police vehicles. Some threw water bottles at police officers in riot gear, while others were seen lifting police barricades and throwing them at police cars. In Philadelphia, police said protests at City Hall and the Art Museum began peacefully before a group of others began “committing criminal acts, including vandalism.” In Atlanta, police braced for more potential protests and arrests Saturday night. Members of the National Guard gathered at Lenox Square Mall after the police department said it would be assisted by about 20 other agencies to monitor activity and “protect vulnerable business districts and retail centers” Protests turned deadly in some cities A nation cooped up for weeks over coronavirus restrictions and suffering from resulting job losses saw throngs of people demonstrating in the streets of more than 30 cities on Friday. People initially gathered peacefully in some places but anger boiled over as the hours passed. At a protest in Detroit, one person was shot dead. In Oakland, California, one Federal Protective Service officer was killed and one other injured Friday in a shooting at the downtown federal building during protests in the city, police said. Details about what led to the shooting weren’t immediately available. “It’s about time this police brutality has to stop. I don’t agree with breaking into all of the businesses, but I can understand the outrage after REPEATED incidents,” Mackenzie Slagle said of protests in Oakland. “Because I’m a white woman, and I needed to show up for all my brothers and sisters.” In Atlanta, protests turned violent when a crowd set fire to a police car and smashed windows at CNN Center. “What I see happening on the streets of Atlanta is not Atlanta. This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. This is chaos,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said. “Killer” was scrawled across a damaged police car in Los Angeles where protesters lined up along a freeway to block traffic. At least two officers were injured during the night, said the LAPD. But other cities saw a contrast of demonstrators. In Minneapolis, the epicenter of the demonstrations, some protesters knelt under a bridge and prayed while others tossed rocks at officers who fired rubber bullets in return. Minneapolis and St. Paul were under a curfew after looting and arson broke out during days of protests. But hundreds took to the streets as police fired tear gas and protesters hid behind cars. And in Springfield, Massachusetts, hundreds gathered peacefully. “If you can tell me something better for me to do — if you can tell me a way that we could change the world without trying to make noise like that, then I’ll get out of the streets,” Max Bailey, 22, said at the protests in Denver. Video shows 3 officers kneeling on George Floyd Derek Chauvin, the former officer charged in Floyd’s death, is being detained at the Ramsey County Jail in Saint Paul, a spokeswoman with the state’s bureau of criminal apprehension told CNN. He is facing third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. His bail has been set at $500,000. Chauvin, who is white, and three other officers detained Floyd, who was black, in handcuffs Monday after he allegedly used a counterfeit bill at a convenience store. Outrage grew after a video surfaced showing Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for a total of 8 minutes, 46 seconds, according to a criminal complaint filed Friday. All four officers were fired this week after Floyd’s death. New video posted on social media appears to show three Minneapolis police officers — not just Chauvin — kneeling on Floyd during his arrest. CNN has not been able to locate the person who shot the footage. The new video shows the other side of the Minneapolis police vehicle — the side opposite shown in the first video. A preliminary autopsy said the combined effects of Floyd being restrained, potential intoxicants in his system and underlying health issues, including heart disease, contributed to his death. So far, there are physical findings to support strangulation as the cause of death, the medical examiner said but CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta cautioned it doesn’t necessarily mean Floyd didn’t die from asphyxiation. CNN has reached out to the former officer’s attorney and the Minneapolis police union for comment. The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company. All rights reserved.",0.0
1621364482,2020-05-31 03:44:00,LA County Under State Of Emergency Amid Saturday's George Floyd Protests,https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/la-county-under-state-emergency-amid-saturdays-george-floyd-protests,en,False,,138019,boisestatepublicradio.org,http://boisestatepublicradio.org/,"Updated at 12:29 p.m. Police and demonstrators clashed in dozens of cities across the U.S. on Saturday during another night of protests in response to the death of George Floyd. At least one person is dead after being shot in Indianapolis. Police are investigating whether the incident was connected to demonstrations in the city. In Los Angeles, protesters blocked the 110 freeway downtown and were seen breaking windows of stores at The Grove mall. Floyd, 46, died after being arrested in Minneapolis on Monday. A video shows a police officer kneeling on his neck for at least seven minutes while Floyd is heard saying he cannot breathe. That police officer was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers were present but have not been charged. All four were fired. Overnight curfews were enacted in cities nationwide — including Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Louisville, San Francisco and Denver — as authorities sought to stem any violence. The National Guard was also activated in several states, including Texas, Georgia, Washington, Ohio and Kentucky. In Minneapolis, authorities reported a ratcheting down of the previous night's unrest after an influx of National Guard troops and state troopers were dispatched to the city. ""Clearly we did not have the numbers in [Minneapolis police] alone,"" the city's mayor, Jacob Frey told Minnesota Public Radio early Sunday. ""Additional force was necessary."" Law enforcement began to make arrests in Minneapolis after an 8 p.m. curfew as crowds gathered at the 5th Precinct police building. Paul Schnell, the state corrections commissioner, said at a Saturday night press conference that an official count of arrests was not yet available but that authorities were ""committed to do whatever it takes to bring order."" Former Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden released a statement early Sunday morning condemning the violence and urging Americans to ""take care of each other."" ""Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response,"" he wrote. ""But burning down communities and needless destruction is not."" We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 Biden added, ""the act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest."" 1 person fatally shot in Indianapolis At least one person has died after being shot in downtown Indianapolis Saturday night. Police Chief Randal Taylor said at a press conference that authorities were still investigating the incident's connection to ongoing demonstrations in the city. ""Downtown is not safe at this time,"" Taylor said. He urged residents who do not live in the area to leave. Mayor Joe Hogsett called the day's protests ""successful"" in a tweet, but condemned the ""small group of people"" that grew violent later in the night. This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard.  Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop. — Mayor Joe Hogsett (@IndyMayorJoe) May 31, 2020 Police cruisers seen going through crowds in New York Several videos of protests in New York showed a police patrol vehicle driving through crowds of protesters. Protesters are seen surrounding and throwing debris at a car while another one drove into them. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the footage ""upsetting"" at a late night press conference Saturday but said it was ""inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers."" He addressed the city's peaceful protesters, saying they were heard but urging them to go home. ""We hear your desire to see these issues: relationship between police and community, the need for justice, the need for real change in our society,"" he said. ""We appreciate and respect all peaceful protests, but it is now time for people to go home."" California governor declares state of emergency in LA County Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti requested assistance to restore order Saturday night amid protests. A curfew began at 8 p.m. PT and is expected to end at 5:30 a.m. local time. The LAPD said hundreds of protesters were arrested amid the protests. An unlawful assembly was declared in the the Mid-Wilshire area and businesses were asked to close. Protesters blocked the 110 freeway in downtown LA and videos taken at protests showed looting and broken windows at stores in The Grove mall. Garcetti urged protesters to ""take a breath"" and ""step away"" at a press conference. He asked residents to go home and protest peacefully at a later time. We will always protect free speech and Angelenos’ right to live without fear of violence or vandalism. To increase safety for demonstrators, law enforcement and all citizens of Los Angeles, we are putting a curfew in place from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. https://t.co/vy3XM760qb — MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) May 30, 2020 Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the National Guard would be deployed to Los Angeles and proclaimed a state of emergency in Los Angeles County. Governor Newsom has authorized assistance after a request from @LACity and @CountyofLA, and proclaimed a state of emergency in Los Angeles County. https://t.co/pAhSQtBxD1 — Office of the Governor of California (@CAgovernor) May 31, 2020 Tense standoffs outside White House In Washington, National Guard troops were called in Saturday night to assist police and Secret Service officers in blocking off the White House after a day of confrontations between law enforcement and protesters. Demonstrators flocked to the White House and nearby Lafayette Square throughout the afternoon where city and U.S. Park police and the Secret Service maintained barricades and pushed back against protesters, at times using pepper spray in an attempt to disperse crowds. Fireworks were set off and at least one car was set on fire. Buildings in downtown Washington had windows smashed — including the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute and an Apple store. A liquor store and a T-Mobile were also looted as tensions remained high through the early morning. The D.C. police union tweeted that one of its members had been hospitalized after being hit by a rock. We can confirm that at least one member has been hospitalized after being struck with a rock. — DC Police Union (@DCPoliceUnion) May 31, 2020 Earlier on Saturday, President Trump falsely accused the city's mayor, Muriel Bowser, of refusing to let D.C. police assist in containing Friday night's demonstrations. Bowser fired back at Trump at a Saturday press conference, saying the president's warning that ""ominous weapons"" and ""vicious dogs"" awaited any protester who made it past the White House fence was ""no subtle reminder"" of the country's history of segregationist violence. On Sunday morning, Bowser reiterated that sentiment on NBC's Meet The Press. ""I think the president has a responsibility to help calm the nation and he can start by not sending divisive tweets that are meant to harken to the segregationist past of our country and he can start by doing that right now,"" Bowser said. This is a developing story. Some things reported by the media will turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops. ",0.0

The president has said that members of the loosely defined far-left group Antifa — short for ""anti-fascists"" — have led clashes with police and looting in cities across the U.S. since the killing of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis. It's unclear if any group or groups are primarily responsible for escalating protests that began following George Floyd's death on May 25 as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has told the press that he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence. In one tweet on Sunday, Trump said the U.S. ""will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" It's something he has previously floated, and last year two Republican senators introduced a resolution that sought to designate the group as a domestic terrorist organization. Following Trump's tweet, Attorney General William Barr said in a statement that ""[f]ederal law enforcement actions will be directed at apprehending and charging the violent radical agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest."" Barr added: ""The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly."" The clashes, spreading to dozens of cities across the U.S., follow a series of racist incidents and deaths of black people, including Floyd's on Monday. Chauvin, now a former Minneapolis police officer, was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck while holding him in custody as Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers present at the scene have been fired but not arrested or charged. Protests and clashes that have since followed come at a time of unprecedented crisis for the country, with confirmed deaths from the coronavirus pandemic topping 100,000 and millions of people out of work as a result of broad business shutdowns. Minorities, including African Americans, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 deaths and pandemic-induced economic peril. ""The death of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis was a grave tragedy. It should never have happened. It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger, and grief."" pic.twitter.com/lirAMSv4Wo — The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 30, 2020 Trump addressed the demonstrations Saturday, striking a milder tone than he has on Twitter during prepared remarks following a space launch in Florida. He said Floyd's death ""has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger and grief."" He added that he ""understands the pain that people are feeling"" and supports peaceful protest, but that ""the memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists."" ""He should just sometimes stop talking"" Apart from Saturday's remarks, though, Trump has not often played a unifying role in recent days. His tweets about radical-left anarchists have also included criticism of Democratic leadership in Minnesota. In another tweet on Sunday, he blamed the mainstream media for fomenting ""hatred and anarchy."" Time for a change! #2020 https://t.co/AECy2GBfys — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020 On Friday, Trump tweeted provocatively that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase with a racist history that Trump said he was not aware of. Later on, he said his intent was not to make a threat but to register a statement of concern that armed violence can accompany looting. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, said on Fox News Sunday that the president's tweets about demonstrations turning violent are ""not constructive."" Speaking on ABC's This Week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Sunday morning that she's not paying attention to Trump's inflammatory tweets. Instead, she said he ""should be a unifying force in our country. We have seen that with Democratic and Republican presidents all along. They have seen their responsibility to be the president of the United States, to unify our country and not to fuel the flame."" Also Sunday, Keisha Lance Bottoms — mayor of Atlanta, one city that has seen protests and clashes with police — told CBS' Face the Nation that Trump's tweets are ""making it worse"" and ""he should just sometimes stop talking."" In his own statement on Saturday, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, wrote that ""Protesting [Floyd's killing] is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not."" He added that as president, he'd lead the conversation about turning the nation's ""anguish to purpose."" Biden made an unannounced visit on Sunday to the site in Wilmington, Del., where protests had taken place the night before. ",0.0

The announcement on Saturday from the nation's eighth-largest retailer came after Target stores in multiple cities became scenes of violence and unrest. Among the stores where aisles were ransacked was a Target in Minneapolis near the city's 3rd police precinct, where the four officers who were fired after Floyd's death worked. The 3rd Precinct police station was damaged by a fire last week. ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,"" the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. ""At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores."" A Target spokesperson said that the company is evaluating closures and limiting hours on a store-by-store basis. The majority of stores being closed are located in Minnesota and California, where protests in Los Angeles led the National Guard to be deployed. Stores will also close in Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Despite the violence that has hit its stores, the company has voiced support for demonstrators. ""The murder of George Floyd has unleashed the pent-up pain of years, as have the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote in a public letter on Friday. ""We say their names and hold a too-long list of others in our hearts."" It remains unclear whether the looting at Target stores was committed by demonstrators or whether they were the actions of unaffiliated bad actors. But the ongoing demonstrations have focused scrutiny on Target's past work with law enforcement — including partnerships with agencies in at least 2o cities. In Minneapolis, the company partnered with police on a program that helped install closed-circuit television cameras in the downtown area. A 2010 report released with support from the company said the ""genesis of the program was a widespread feeling some years ago in the city of Minneapolis that the downtown business district was not a pleasant place to work or visit.""

1621774502,2020-05-31 14:59:41,A look at kindness and solidarity that emerged during Utah’s protests,https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/05/a-look-at-kindness-and-solidarity-that-emerged-during-utahs-protests/,en,False,,247820,eastidahonews.com,http://eastidahonews.com/,"SALT LAKE CITY (KSL.com) — As the dust settles after a long, dangerous and emotional day of protests in downtown Salt Lake, some moments of kindness and solidarity are emerging. Officers and U.S. Marshals were seen in dialogue with protesters. Some injured protesters made their way over to police where they received help. People provided water for protesters and law enforcement. Here’s a look at the other side of the protests intended to address the circumstances of George Floyd’s death while in the custody of Minneapolis police on Memorial Day, and the people who attended with the best of intentions. Take a knee on Washington Boulevard Protesters met at the Ogden Municipal Building at 2 p.m. on Saturday. The Facebook event encouraged social distancing and wearing of masks. Posts from the event’s organizer, Malik Dayo, also clarified that he had been in contact with the Ogden Police Department before the protest. He assured them that the protest was not aimed at them, but instead focused on “mourning together.” The protest happened the same week that 24-year old Odgen Police Officer Nate Lyday was killed while responding to a domestic violence call. The Standard-Examiner reported that hundreds gathered peacefully on the Ogden Municipal Building steps, and listened to speeches from Dayo and local NAACP organizer Betty Sawyer. According to Dayo, several officers also attended. Following the event, Dayo stated on Facebook: “Ogden family, I want to thank each and every individual who showed up today in solidarity with Minneapolis and to honor the memory of George Floyd. I want to thank every speaker, every volunteer, and everyone who played a part to make this possible. I appreciate the peaceful and loving unity and showing respect to the officers who were present during their time of mourning. I would argue to say that this is the most united Ogden has ever been as far as race is concerned. Let’s continue to lead by example as a city. Great job Ogden this is only the beginning of our journey.” Early protests in Salt Lake City Despite the event escalating into unrest following the ignition of a police car at 200 East and 400 South, thousands of protesters early in the day attempted to keep the event peaceful. The Facebook invite for the protest, labeled the “Car Caravan for Justice, National Day of Protest” event, was originally intended as a vehicle-only protest and discouraged on-foot attendance. Social distancing and health precautions were also encouraged. Many cars and motorcycles followed this invitation and stayed inside their vehicles. Many windows were painted with “Black Lives Matter” signs, and protesters inside pickup trucks held pamphlets and chanted. Despite not being involved in the organization of the protest, as a seasoned protester, Aaron Campbell recognized that hundreds of people might walk anyway. He attempted to keep protesters in groups of 20 to obey social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic. The tactics worked for nearly an hour before a large group of protesters appeared, and the smaller groups merged together. “I knew there were going to be hundreds of people on the ground, so I volunteered to help organize the ground people,” Campbell said. “(I) tried to keep them across the street, but when they crossed over we knew it was going to be a battle to keep them civil.” Once protesters vandalized the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building about noon, Campbell’s pacifist tactics were instrumental in getting protesters to disperse again. “The real hero in all of this is the gentleman in the Harley-Davidson we brought up to the front doors to try to get everyone’s attention to then follow out to disperse the crowd,” Campbell said, citing the loud vehicle and encouragement to keep marching in stopping further immediate vandalism to the building. “We did the best we could with the chaos that was going to ensue,” he added. Protesters then marched to the Utah State Capitol. When asked why he attended the protest, Campbell said, “I used to live in Minnesota, and watching the violence there on both sides just really got to me.” Rod Baker attended the protest with his family in order to “show solidarity,” he said. “Right now it doesn’t seem like anybody cares about what happens to black people and brown people, so I’m here to support their cause because we’re American citizens and police are here to protect us as well as everybody else,” he stated. He also said he brought his children to the protest because he wanted them to be aware of police brutality, and their own right to equal treatment. When protests shifted to the Capitol, many demonstrators brought crates of water bottles and passed them out for free to help avoid attendees suffering heatstroke. Others also offered food and passed out roses. Even when a police patrol vehicle was burned in front of the Salt Lake City Library, the action was met with many crowd members strongly disavowing the action and saying it would not help the movement. One final moment of warmth and compassion caught a KSL.com reporter’s eye. Saturday afternoon, a woman walked into a downtown protest crowd, yelling something the crowd didn’t like. Many scolded her, and then a man in the crowd reached out, put an arm around her and tried to diffuse the situation. The reporter then captured the touching moment.",0.0

To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: As we've heard, many cities saw protests this week. So has Washington, D.C., the nation's capital. There have been peaceful and angry protests set off by the death in police custody of George Floyd. Last night, those protests turned violent. As demonstrators were tear gassed and driven away from the White House. Nearby businesses were vandalized and some small fires set. Now there is another protest underway. Joining us from Washington, D.C., near the White House is NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. And, Danielle, you've been with this group for a few hours. How are things going? DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, HOST: Well, in short, things are tense. But they seem to have calmed down from where they were about an hour ago. Right now, the march had started at Howard University this afternoon. A historically black university here in D.C. It went down to Lafayette Park. North of the White House, and then since then has moved. The march went down near the Mall. It is now sort of looping back towards the White House. But along the way, there were some confrontations with police that I saw between protesters and police, yes. MARTIN: So it sounds like the mood has definitely shifted from when you started. KURTZLEBEN: Yes because, you know, it was a peaceful protest with chanting, you know, going from the university to the White House with a police escort. It was loud. It was enthusiastic, certainly not violent in any way. Then, down at Lafayette Park, what happened was the protesters were up against some barricade facing a long line of Secret Service members and also D.C. Park Police. And things just got progressively tenser - again, not out of control, not exactly violent. But there were times when you would see the Secret Service advance on the crowd as the crowd got louder and more agitated. And the crowd would run. The crowd would scream. The crowd would yell back at them. Things were getting more and more tense, yes. MARTIN: Now we hear that the mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser, has weighed in. KURTZLEBEN: Yes. She has put in place a curfew starting at 11:00 p.m. tonight. It will go until 6:00 a.m. in the morning. So the big question then is, you know, how quickly these protesters clear the streets because that is rapidly approaching. MARTIN: So what have people that you've been spending time with today told you about why they're there? KURTZLEBEN: They've told me they're fed up. They've told me that, you know, they keep seeing police violence against black men in particular, black women also, and that they're tired of seeing it. Aside from that, I've been watching people confront the police. I was there for a pretty tense confrontation between people and police. And especially a lot of black protesters going up to some black members of the D.C. police force, sometimes reaching out and saying, you're my brother, you're my sister, but sometimes asking them, hey, why are you doing this job? I am very sad and ashamed that you do this job. And, you know, in some cases, I was right there when they shot or threw I believe it was a smoke bomb into the crowd. There were some really loud booms, some very tense, scary moments for these protesters here in downtown D.C. today. Again, I will say I haven't seen anybody hurt. Nothing is out of control or anything like that that I have seen. MARTIN: That is NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. She is presently at Lafayette Park, which is near the White House. Danielle, thank you so much for your reporting. KURTZLEBEN: Yes, of course. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

In a post on the Idaho Black History Museum Facebook page Saturday evening, museum director Phillip Thompson also urged the community to avoid the gatherings. “Due to the violence that has ensued, brought about largely by outside agitators solely motivated by causing chaos, destruction, and death which in many cases is reported as being white nationalists and anarchists I implore you to stay home for your own safety,” Thompson wrote. “We will/are planning an opportunity to stand in solidarity safely. Many of the events being ‘planned’ are spurious being led by obscure, unknown, not local individuals.” Yet another image shared on social media showed George Floyd surrounded by flowers and said a “black-led event” would be held on the capitol steps at 10 a.m. on Sunday in solidarity with Minneapolis. It’s not clear which rally attendees were turning out to support, but Poasa said he was pleasantly surprised by the turnout. “What we really were here to do is to organize words of power.

Saturday night's gathering was quickly declared a ""civil disturbance"" as SWAT officers spread throughout the city in an effort to quell rioting and violence. Officers said they arrested 48 adults and nine underage kids, who were later released to their parents.

Several social media posts going around Portland claimed there would be a riot at the Lloyd Center Mall on the east side, but a heavy police presence began in the area about an hour prior. The Lloyd District area, like downtown, was quickly deemed an ""unlawful assembly"" as some demonstrators gathered there. Police tweeted around 2 a.m., saying things had died down. Police used flash bangs against the crowd earlier in the evening, as they gathered at the Multnomah County Justice Center in downtown Portland around 8 p.m. Saturday. Protesters targeted the Justice Center Friday night, and set several small fires on the ground floor. The high-rise houses hundreds of inmates. Initially, hundreds of protesters attended the demonstration, but quickly disbursed into smaller groups as Portland police attempted to break up the gathering. As of 10 p.m., only small groups remained downtown. The protests began in Portland Friday night, following a vigil for George Floyd, the black man killed by a Minneapolis police officer.",0.0

A curfew will be in effect at 5 p.m. Sunday. SEATTLE — Protests in downtown Seattle turned violent and chaotic on Saturday following a peaceful rally over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan issued a mandatory citywide curfew that expired at 5 a.m. Sunday. The curfew resumes again from 5 p.m. Sunday to 5 a.m. Monday. Several cars were set on fire, including police and transit vehicles and dozens of downtown businesses were tagged, damaged or looted, including Nordstrom, Target, Old Navy, and T-Mobile. Police said several incendiary devices, including Molotov cocktails, were thrown during the protests. ""These devices quickly ignited several city and private vehicles,"" said Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best. Some protesters and officers were injured in the chaos, although no serious injuries have been reported. Chief Best said at least 55 people were arrested “for a variety of offenses from assault, to arson, to destruction and looting.” KING 5 reporter Kalie Greenberg said some people were still looting businesses downtown Sunday morning after the curfew was lifted, while others in the area were taking pictures of the damage. As the sun began to rise, volunteers and community members started showing up downtown to clean up broken glass and help secure businesses after the night of destructive protests. Brian O’Kelly said he drove in from Woodinville Sunday morning to help with the cleanup effort. “We had another guy down here who said he’d been here all night scrapping graffiti off a window. It’s awesome. I was like, ‘is this your business?’ ‘No, I’m just here cause I can,’” said O’Kelly. “There is more of that than the people who were breaking stuff. You know, if you’re bent on breaking stuff, you can break a lot of stuff in a short amount of time. This doesn’t take a lot of people to do this. It’s going to take a lot of us to clean up the mess, though.” Seattle Police Department Chief Carmen Best and Mayor Jenny Durkan were both downtown by 9 a.m. surveying the damage and speaking to volunteers helping clean the streets. “I’m totally inspired. It’s totally gratifying and so wonderful and heartening to see all of these people out here. Volunteers helping to clean up the destruction, and the graffiti, and all of the damage from last night,” said Chief Best. At least one Facebook event was created asking people to come downtown at 11 a.m. Sunday to help clean. Gov. Jay Inslee activated up to 200 members of the Washington National Guard to help law enforcement in Seattle. Guard personnel will be unarmed and work under the direction of Seattle city leadership. David Postman, Gov. Inslee’s Chief of Staff, said it is the first time the National Guard has been called into Seattle since the WTO Riots in 1999. Mayor Durkan imposed the curfew and issued a civil emergency proclamation, including an order prohibiting the use of weapons of any kind. ""The escalated incidents of destruction and violence do not honor Mr. Floyd,"" said Mayor Durkan during an evening news conference, where she emphasized that George Floyd's family has condemned the violent protests that have been happening across the country this week. The violent demonstrations ""cannot and will not be allowed to continue,"" Durkan said. People gathered downtown Saturday afternoon to hold a peaceful protest following the death of George Floyd, a black man killed in Minneapolis Monday night while in police custody. The protests started out peaceful at Seattle Police Department headquarters, but things escalated after protesters marched to Westlake Center to hold a rally. Seattle police said people in the crowd threw fireworks towards people attending the rally and injured citizens and officers. ""At 2:38 p.m. the first dispersal order was issued as the demonstration became unlawful and then a riot. Offenders were throwing and using incendiary devices including Molotov cocktails. These devices quickly ignited several city and private vehicles,"" said Chief Best. Several Seattle police vehicles were set on fire at 5th Ave. and Pine Street. The Seattle Fire Department had to respond to put out the flames. Two rifles were also stolen from the SPD vehicles but later recovered, according to SPD. Later in the evening, other government-owned vehicles were set ablaze. Several storefronts downtown were also damaged and looted. Seattle police said at least 55 people were arrested. Durkan said she's been in touch with federal authorities to investigate some of the crimes that have been committed. A woman attending the peaceful rally told KING 5 she is furious that other people not involved in the peaceful protest became destructive. ""They hijacked our protest... I am furious,"" said the woman. ""It has totally taken away from what we came down here to do."" Police used pepper spray, flashbangs, and other methods to disperse the large crowds downtown. The crowds eventually made their way onto I-5, where they blocked traffic. Both directions of I-5 were closed for several hours before reopening around 12:30 a.m. Sunday. Governor Jay Inslee issued a statement regarding the protests Saturday afternoon, saying he respects the right of all to gather peacefully but that destruction would not be tolerated. ""As people gather today to protest the unjust death of George Floyd, I hope they do so peacefully and safely. Everyone has the freedom - and the right - to demonstrate and speak their mind. However, violence and destruction have no place in Washington state or our country,"" said Gov. Inslee in his statement. ""Together, we grieve for the death of George Floyd, and many, many others. The events in Minnesota and across the nation the past few nights have been stunning and illustrate how inequity causes people to lose faith in their public institutions. The trauma inflicted on generations of people of color must be acknowledged, and more must be done to correct it. Feeling second-class in one’s own community does not make people feel safe. Insecurity hardens into anger. ""I fully support the right to free speech and peaceful assembly. I applaud every Washingtonian standing for what they believe in, but we must do so in a way that allows space for these important and necessary discussions, not in a way that inspires fear. ""If you choose to protest today, please be safe and peaceful. These are important issues that deserve our full attention, without distraction from violence and destruction. Without solutions to inequity, the long road to justice will run even longer."" Saturday's protests are the second day of destructive demonstrations in Seattle. A peaceful rally in Seattle's International District Friday evening turned destructive when part of the group started moving downtown. Demonstrators broke glass at several properties downtown during Friday night's march, including shattered windows at an Amazon Go store, and a Fed Ex building. The Seattle Fire Department issued a warning to downtown businesses to secure their outdoor property and remove combustibles. Flashbangs, pepper spray, and smoke bombs were deployed during the protest on Friday, with some minor injuries reported. At least seven people were arrested, including five accused of assaulting a police officer. The Seattle Police Department issued a statement Saturday regarding the previous night's protests and addressed their use of force in one of the arrests. Here is SPD's statement in full: ""Every year, the Seattle Police Department facilitates over 300 free speech events, the vast majority without incident or arrest. Our policies and training are built around maximizing the exercise of free speech without officer intervention. The Seattle Police Department will continue to support the peaceful exercise of First Amendment rights. We will not, however, tolerate violence and property destruction. Individuals engaging in this behavior will be arrested. During the demonstrations last night, amidst property destruction and confrontations with officers, there were several arrests. In one arrest, which has received media attention, officers used force. Under SPD’s policies relating to crowd management and review of force, any force that is used during the course of last night’s event will undergo a high level of scrutiny and review by the chain of command, SPD’s Force Review Board, the Office of Police Accountability, and the Office of the Inspector General."" The protests are happening to stand against police brutality and to honor the life of George Floyd. Four Minneapolis police officers involved in the arrest were fired and one has been arrested after Floyd was pinned to the ground for around eight minutes as an officer pressed his knee on his neck. Video captured by a bystander shows Floyd begging for help, saying “I can't breathe.” Andre Taylor, Founder and Executive Director of Not This Time, organized Saturday's peaceful rally at Westlake Park and explained the importance of being able to peacefully protest in an interview with KING 5 on Friday. ""We have COVID-19 that isolated people. Now people are isolated in that anger,"" said Taylor. ""To have a space where people could yell, could scream, could cry, could march to relieve some of that frustration."" Taylor said it is an opportunity to send a message about what happened to George Floyd, and the video he has seen of the handcuffed black man pleading for air while a white officer kneeled on his neck. Chief Best released a statement earlier this week to her officers calling the video of Floyd's arrest ""upsetting, disappointing and infuriating."" “Because of the Seattle Police Department’s high level of training, our commitment to de-escalation, and our track record of limiting the use of force, I have confidence that something like this would not occur in our city,” Chief Best said in the statement.",0.0
1621805603,2020-05-31 18:32:59,Journalists covering protests face assault and arrest,https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/05/journalists-covering-protests-face-assault-and-arrest/,en,False,,247820,eastidahonews.com,http://eastidahonews.com/,"(CNN) — From Minneapolis to Washington DC, from Louisville to Las Vegas, reporters are facing assault and arrest while reporting on widespread protests and unrest. At least a half dozen different incidents were reported on Friday, starting with the wrongful arrest of a CNN crew in Minneapolis and ending with the arrest of two photographers in Las Vegas. Another disturbing episode took place on Saturday, when Ian Smith, a photojournalist for KDKA TV in Pittsburgh, said he was “attacked” by protesters downtown. “They stomped and kicked me,” he wrote in a tweet from the back of an ambulance. “I’m bruised and bloody but alive. My camera was destroyed. Another group of protesters pulled me out and saved my life. Thank you!” Reporters by and large said they wanted the attention to be focused on the communities they cover, not on their own safety concerns. Still, the incidents provoked concern from a range of advocacy groups. “Journalists have a clear First Amendment right to cover public events,” Freedom of the Press Foundation advocacy director Parker Higgins said in a statement. In Louisville, Kentucky, where protesters have been calling for accountability for a black woman who was fatally shot by police in March, an officer fired what appeared to be pepper balls at a reporter for WAVE 3 News, a local TV station. The incident was broadcast live on the air. “Who are they aiming that at?” the anchor asked. “At us,” the reporter replied. The reporter, Kaitlin Rust, and her cameraman were “courageously and lawfully” covering the news when they were targeted, the station said in a statement. “There is simply no justification for the Louisville police to wantonly open fire, even with pepper balls, on any journalists under any circumstances.” Louisville Metro Police Special Advisor Jessie Halladay issued an apology to Rust. Halladay said she had reviewed the video and said the incident was not something that should have occurred if Rust was singled out as a reporter. Reporters for another Louisville TV station, WLKY, were targeted by protesters on Friday night. A WLKY news vehicle was destroyed and a videojournalist “was attacked so badly he had to go to the ER,” anchor Julie Dolan said on Twitter. Many TV networks are dispatching private security guards to support journalists who are in the field at protests. “These situations could have been much worse had it not been for security,” Dolan said. Security guards were involved when a Fox News crew was harassed and chased out of Lafayette Park, one block from the White House, on Friday night. Videos of the incident showed protesters cursing at Fox and criticizing right-wing media. Correspondent Leland Vittert, cameraman Christian Galdabini and two security guards left the park as the crowd grew more and more hostile. According to Fox, “Vittert and the crew were punched and hit with projectiles as they fled, and a Fox News camera was broken when a member of the mob tried to grab it.” Journalists from rival outlets supported the Fox crew and condemned the violence. CNN anchor Jake Tapper called it an “unacceptable assault on freedom of the press.” The moment Minneapolis police and state troopers stormed the Stop-N-Shop and trained their weapons on property owners and #journalists, pepper spraying @vicenews correspondent @MichaelAdams317 while he’s lying on the ground, Press ID above his head. pic.twitter.com/ZBcrASSn9U — Roberto Daza (@rsdaza) May 31, 2020 CBS correspondent Ed O’Keefe wrote on Twitter, “Whether it’s police officers or everyday Americans — keep your hands, weapons and handcuffs off of *any* journalist exercising their First Amendment right to report the news. Period.” Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott said in a Saturday memo, obtained by CNN Business, that the company is taking “all necessary security precautions to safeguard all of our journalists and reporting crews.” Journalists in several cities said they were exposed to tear gas and other materials used to disperse crowds. In Minneapolis, photographer and author Linda Tirado said on Twitter that she was blinded in her left eye. What “we think happened is I took a rubber bullet to the face,” she wrote. “It exploded my eyeball, which has now been patched back together but who knows if it’ll need more surgery. My vision is gone no matter what it winds up looking like scar wise.” In Denver, a crew from KMGH TV reported being hit with paintballs and tear gas. In Phoenix, reporter Briana Whitney was accosted by a protester while she was live on the air. “I was intentionally tackled by this man while I was on air trying to report what was happening during the protest at Phoenix PD headquarters,” she said at the end of the night. “I feel violated, and this was terrifying.” In Las Vegas, two photojournalists on assignment to cover protests were taken into police custody on Friday night. Photographer Bridget Bennett told CNN Business that she was detained along with another photojournalist at the protest location. “I’m a freelance photojournalist and was working on assignment for AFP. I was released this morning,” Bennett said. She declined further comment. Ellen Schmidt, a staff photojournalist at the Las Vegas Review-Journal, was also arrested. Review-Journal executive editor Glenn Cook said in an email message, “it is appalling that Las Vegas police officers, who have nothing to do with what happened in Minnesota, would so forcefully take into custody two people who were obviously working photojournalists and posed no threat to law enforcement or public safety. They never should have been touched, let alone arrested and then booked into jail.” On Saturday morning, the recovery efforts began. At CNN Center, the network’s flagship building in Atlanta, protesters’ graffiti on the CNN logo was removed. An internal memo reassured staffers that everyone at the building was safe. UN secretary general António Guterres was moved to post a message defending the rights of the press. “When journalists are attacked, societies are attacked,” he tweeted Saturday morning. “No democracy can function without press freedom nor can any society be fair without journalists who investigate wrongdoing and speak truth to power.”",0.0

That was after some initial confusion over the event. Multiple social media events sprung up last week for Sunday morning or afternoon, including marches around downtown. Some even called for protesters to rebuke the events altogether, citing concerns over violent undertones and the people behind the protests. That didn’t deter the several hundred who showed up Sunday, though. Anyone who wanted to speak was welcomed to talk to the group through a bullhorn. People shared their stories and perspectives on racism, fear, hope for change, and sorrow over the death of George Floyd and many others like him. Shala Browning is a Boise native and mother to a 16-year-old boy. She shared her anxieties and reactions to Floyd’s death at the protest. “It’s not ok. We’re tired of it. And we want to know what we can do. This is just one step. So now what do we do after this? Everybody’s going to go home, but what gets done after today?” she asked. She added that it’s going to take more than just her. “I could tell you all day long how I feel, but we all have our own opinions and together as a community we could make things work definitely,” she said. The protest was peaceful, though there were a few moments of disagreement in the crowd. One involved a man in a Hawaiian shirt and a few firearms walking into the crowd. Some started shouting and saying that he was trying to intimidate the protesters, but an older woman stepped in and talked with the armed man instead. Only about a dozen uniformed police officers were around, either on foot or on a bike. None were in riot gear. Anthony Bruner also came to the Boise protest and spoke. He's black with a 10-year-old son and fears for his son's life. He’d like to see these kinds of protests spark more permanent change. “We have to do something. And the government officials, they have to work with us,” he said. “Or if not, what’s going on right now is going to grow. It’s going to grow because people are tired.” Find reporter Madelyn Beck on Twitter @MadelynBeck8 Copyright 2020 Boise State Public Radio",0.0
1621909511,2020-05-31 18:35:55,Protest in solidarity with Black Lives Matter to take place at 4 p.m. in Pullman,https://www.uiargonaut.com/2020/05/31/protest-in-solidarity-with-black-lives-matter-to-take-place-at-4-p-m-in-pullman/,en,False,,317893,uiargonaut.com,http://uiargonaut.com/,"A peaceful protest in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) marches happening around the globe will take place at 4 p.m. today in Pullman, according to a Facebook event. “I hope that you will all join us to peacefully demonstrate and send a message to the world that our community is here to support our (people of color) community members,” the Facebook event said. Protests have erupted across the U.S. in response to the actions of a Minneapolis police officer responsible for the death of George Floyd, a black man. The white officer, Derek Chauvin, was captured on video pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck, who can be heard pleading “I can’t breathe,” repeatedly before he eventually becomes unresponsive. Chauvin has since been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, according to an article from the New York Times. Pullman Police officer Todd Dow said the organizer of Pullman’s protest notified the department in advance, and they don’t expect any violence. “Our plan really is just to give them space and let them voice their opinions,” Dow said. “We’ll be close by in case something does happen.” In a statement Friday, Pullman Police Department Chief Gary Jenkins condemned the actions of the Minneapolis police officer responsible for Floyd’s death and said his department is disgusted by the incident. The Facebook event for Pullman’s protest has asked protestors to stay six feet apart and wear personal protective equipment like masks and gloves. The post also says violence and non-peaceful demonstrations will not be tolerated. The march will go through downtown Pullman, beginning at the Gladdish Community center parking lot.

Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Louisville, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds. More than 17,000 National Guard troops have been activated in states across the U.S. due to civil unrest as of Monday, and that number is expected to grow. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody last Monday. Video shows that a Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes shortly before his death. Tensions were already simmering following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was jogging through a Glynn County, Ga., neighborhood when he was shot dead. Three white men were arrested last month after state investigators took over the case from local authorities. Protests also continued for a fourth straight night in Louisville, Ky., as activists called for justice for Taylor. Police shot and killed the 26-year-old black woman in her home. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitrailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown that had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed, northbound on Interstate 35W. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. ""It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn't appear to drive through any barricades,"" the department tweeted. Some protesters jumped on top of the truck, and as it stopped, they dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. ""He was driving a gas tanker,"" said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. ""He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful."" State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so that the protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest had appeared peaceful. Tensions flare in the nation's capital Washington, D.C., authorities imposed a curfew after an evening of escalating demonstrations. Protesters threw bottles at police and set fires to cars and the basement of historic St. John's Church, which has been visited by every president since James Madison. ""Tonight's curfew will begin at 7 p.m. and will run for two days,"" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a late morning news conference on Monday. It's primary day in the nation's capital on Tuesday, and the curfew goes into effect an hour before polls close at 8 p.m., according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections website. The protests on Sunday began with peaceful marchers, along with a police escort, moving their way along a nearly 2-mile stretch from Howard University to Lafayette Square in front of the White House. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd and other African Americans who have died following police violence. ""Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,"" read a sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. ""It's crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,"" she said. ""We are at a point where it's the same story, the same things are happening. I'm tired of this."" But after clashes with law enforcement and the fires erupting, police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Kentucky authorities investigate shooting death in Louisville Kentucky's governor said that one person died early Monday as security forces confronted a crowd in central Louisville. ""While working to disperse a crowd, [Louisville Metro Police Department] and the Kentucky National Guard were fired upon,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. ""LMPD and the Kentucky National Guard returned fire resulting in a death."" He announced that the Kentucky State Police will be investigating the matter. Statement from Governor Andy Beshear: pic.twitter.com/MyHxcE3Ntn — Governor Andy Beshear (@GovAndyBeshear) June 1, 2020 Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted his ""deepest condolences"" for the family of the man, whom he identified as David McAtee. Fischer also called for a Day of Reflection on Monday. He held a late morning virtual gathering on Facebook with faith leaders after another night of demonstrations in the city over the death of Breonna Taylor. On Sunday, law enforcement officers earlier fired tear gas into a crowd assembled in the Jefferson Square area of the city, NPR member station WFPL reported. At a Sunday evening news conference, Fischer again thanked those protesting peacefully but said others were ""hijacking"" their efforts. Tomorrow, Monday, June 1, 2020 I am declaring a Day of Reflection in our city. We will have a virtual gathering at 11:30 a.m. Monday on Facebook with local faith leaders. We’ll be talking about the events of the last few days & acknowledging the pain we’ve all felt. 2/2 — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) June 1, 2020 Atlanta officers terminated for excessive force Two Atlanta police officers have been terminated and three others placed on desk duty after a video of the arrest of two young African Americans leaving the protests Saturday night went viral. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the officers' firing on Sunday, saying the footage ""was disturbing on many levels."" ""We understand our officers are working very long hours, under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that veteran officers Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter were terminated. The footage from Streeter's body camera shows the officers confronting the pair as the two were leaving the downtown protests after the 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. At roughly the 2:30 mark in the video, one of them is seen sitting in the driver's seat of a car, recording officers arresting someone else. An officer opens the car door and asks the driver if he wants to go to jail. Several minutes later, officers approach the car again. One uses a baton to smash the driver's side window. Police then use a stun gun on the driver, who has been identified by local media as Messiah Young. Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that Young suffered an epileptic seizure, according to Spelman College's Student Government Association. The second person, a woman who has since been identified as Taniyah Pilgrim, has been released from custody and charges against her dropped. Footage posted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows the passenger pleading with police to stop as they also use a stun gun against her. ''They haven't heard us"": Protests escalate in Southern California Vandalism and violence broke out after peaceful protests in Santa Monica and other parts of Southern California on Sunday — a sequence of events that has become familiar in many U.S. cities in the past week. The new round of destruction came despite a curfew and the presence of the National Guard. ""We tried kneeling,"" protester Jesus Guzman, 19, told NPR's Doualy Xaykaothao near the Santa Monica Pier. ""We tried putting on those T-shirts that said 'I can't breathe.' We tried those hashtags. We tried doing it all peacefully, but they haven't heard us — they haven't done nothing."" ""The violence, for him, is justified,"" Xaykaothao reported. With store windows smashed, some shop owners in Santa Monica started cleaning up the mess overnight — the latest setback after weeks of forced closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At their hair salon, Martha Padilla-Bruni and her family were sweeping up broken glass under the streetlights. ""I'm in shock. I don't know what's going to happen,"" Padilla-Bruni told NPR's Nathan Rott. Her son, Joe Franco, said he supports the protesters and those who were there earlier in the day. He said he understands that people are in pain. Franco said, ""But I was here across the street, and what I saw, the people that were doing this ... they were not here to protest. They were here to cause trouble."" Reporter in Long Beach, Calif., hit in throat by rubber bullet KPCC/LAist reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez was hit in the throat by a rubber bullet Sunday evening during protests in Long Beach, Calif. He believes the bullet was fired by Long Beach police, who had been firing the projectiles nearby. ""I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat,"" Guzman-Lopez said via Twitter, posting an image of his wound. ""I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street."" I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat.

The reporter said he had just finished interviewing a man who had been kneeling in protest when he himself was hit. ""I talked to him for about a minute, and just as I was finishing talking to him — right after I said, 'Thank you' — I heard a pop and I felt something, you know, the bottom of my throat, and I saw something bounced onto the ground, and then I ran,"" he said. ""As I was running, I did start to feel its sting, and then I put my fingers to my throat and there was blood on my fingers."" A number of journalists have been hit with police projectiles during the protests, including MSNBC's Ali Velshi, who was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet in Minneapolis, and a Louisville TV reporter who was shot with pepper balls. NPR's Gerry Holmes contributed to this report. : 6/03/20 An earlier version of this story mistakenly said the truck drove into the crowd while westbound on Interstate 35.

A volunteer from the neighborhood walks out onto Lake Street. ""Is this your business?"" she asks. Safia and her daughter Saida Hassan nod silently. ""I'm sorry,"" the woman says. It's the first time they've seen it since fiery protests erupted among cries for racial justice and as state troopers in riot gear blocked the road to this street. The walls are charred black, the kitchen reduced to rubble. Glass and water are swimming in puddles as community members around them work to sweep away the destruction. Safia looks around stunned. Hers is one of hundreds of businesses damaged or destroyed in protests on Thursday and Friday night. ""Alhamdulillah,"" she repeats quietly. Praise God. ""Everyone is safe."" ""My heart is broken. My mind is broken,"" she says. ""I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice."" George Floyd is the African American man who died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee for several minutes last Monday. Protests started in Minneapolis early last week and quickly spread across the country. Floyd's pleading words to the officer, ""I can't breathe,"" are now a rallying cry for people protesting the many black people who have died in police custody. Safia, a Somali immigrant, opened the restaurant in December 2018 with her retirement savings. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, she closed the restaurant and had to choose between paying for insurance and paying staff. So Safia chose her staff. That means there are no funds to rebuild. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family. This weekend, she had planned to reopen as the city started easing stay-at-home orders. She spent over $4,000 on groceries and cleanup. Now that plan is gone. ""It's not just me,"" she says. ""It's all of Lake Street, all of Minneapolis."" Her daughter Saida nods. ""This is a city in pain,"" Saida says. Across the street a row of restaurants — all locally owned, black- and immigrant-owned — are all gone. But the library is OK. In the rubble, Saida finds the sign she made for her mother when the restaurant first opened. Against the black ash the wood plaque is pristine. It reads ""Mama Safia's Kitchen. Seasoned with Love."" ""Because she always cooks with love,"" Saida says. She pulls a few more knickknacks that haven't burned. ""Most of the artifacts here, I got them from Africa,"" she says. ""This one is from Somalia."" She puts them into a tiny pile of what is salvageable. Outside is a tower of all that is lost. Her sister Bibi Abdullah walks in to help. She finds prayer rugs in the banquet room her mom would rent out for small wedding dinners and religious holidays. ""We can still use these,"" she says. ""We just have to wash them."" She searches for more things she can save. ""The truth is things like this happen when people feel powerless. Something has to change,"" Bibi says. Her voice catches. Her body seems to vibrate with a mix of anger and sadness. She says she hopes that these demonstrations translate to voters at the polls come November. ""It came to this because we have people that do not care in positions of power and it should not be that way,"" Bibi says. She and her sister start to clear the big debris together. Then Saida leads her mother, Safia, to the kitchen in the back so they can assess the damage. It's a tunnel of charred walls, ash and debris. Safia gets upset and pulls away, speaking to her daughter in Somali. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" Saida responds in English as her mother walks out. ""She's just saying, 'Why are you bringing me in here? I don't want to see this,' "" Saida says. Saida gets quiet. She stands in the kitchen alone for a moment, staring at the charred walls. Then she joins her family outside where dozens of Minneapolis residents from across the city are working in groups to clear the rubble. With everything unfolding, the pandemic has slipped many people's minds. ""I forgot. Have you seen me shake hands with people?"" Saida shakes her head. ""2020, we hear you, we see you. We went from one crisis to the next. What's next?"" Saida spends every night protesting, but also trying to protect other locally owned stores and restaurants. At night, she cries herself to sleep. She understands the anger and desperation that are leading some to destroy buildings. ""I'm like emotionally torn,"" Saida says. She doesn't want destruction. ""But at the same time, people are crying for help. People are saying, 'Fix this.' "" She says she hopes, from all of this pain, finally there will be change. ",0.0

Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Some health experts have warned that a resurgence in cases could take place if Americans don't adhere to strict social distancing, or take other precautions like wear masks. The White House has also said that cases could go down in the warmer summer months. Does that happen? And if so, do Americans get too comfortable and lapse into a false sense of security — only to see a spike in the fall? None of it's clear, but the U.S. is heading into a period of pandemic experimentation with no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus as yet. 3. Could Steve King lose? Steny Hoyer faces challenge: It's hard to believe, but there are elections on Tuesday. Two of the marquee races deal with well-known — and very different — political figures. Controversial Rep. Steve King, with a history of making racist remarks, is in a fight for his political life with state Sen. Randy Feenstra in Iowa's Republican primary. Conservative groups have lined up against King, but he can't be counted out. This district has a long history of voting for him, despite his pariah status within the party. In Maryland, Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, is facing a primary challenge from the left in 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes, inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's unlikely win in New York over Joe Crowley, a former congressional Democratic leader. Iowa, Maryland and several other states, plus Washington, D.C., hold primaries Tuesday. 4. Biden to get closer to officially clinching nomination: Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is on the ballot Tuesday, too. Remember, he still hasn't acquired the delegates needed to officially put him over the top for the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of doing that. With 500 at stake Tuesday, Biden needs 85% of them Tuesday to clinch. That's unlikely, so look at next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote — with their 133 delegates up for grabs — for Biden to hit the magic number of 1,991. (Follow all the math here with the NPR delegate tracker.) 5. Origins of Trump campaign investigation to be probed: In Congress, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into members of the 2016 Trump campaign. The Senate is also expected to vote on nominations, including for the Treasury Department's inspector general for the pandemic response. And action is possible on changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. Last week, the House, nearly unanimously, passed a bill that reduces the percentage of the loans that businesses have to use toward payroll and gives businesses more time to spend the money and to pay the loans back. Flashback quotation: ""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, 'Please don't be too nice.' When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head]. Like, 'Don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?' "" — Trump, on July 28, 2017, speaking to law enforcement officers in Long Island, N.Y. : 5/31/20 A previous version of this story misspelled Freddie Gray's first name as Freddy.",0.0

But he wrote in a post Monday on Medium that the ""the small minority of folks who've resorted to violence"" at many demonstrations are ""putting innocent people at risk, compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause."" He recounted seeing an interview, where he said, ""I saw an elderly black woman being interviewed today in tears because the only grocery store in her neighborhood had been trashed. If history is any guide, that store may take years to come back. So let's not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."" The country's first African American president weighed in after the nation experienced a sixth night of protests — which in some cities turned violent — following the death of Floyd, a black man, after being kneeled on by at least one Minneapolis officer, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The Democrat, who often admonishes people to vote, said that ""we should be fighting to make sure that we have a president, a Congress, a U.S. Justice Department, and a federal judiciary that actually recognize the ongoing, corrosive role that racism plays in our society and want to do something about it."" But he wrote that the officials ""who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system"" work at the state and local levels. Mayors and county executives, Obama wrote, appoint police chiefs and negotiate with police unions, while district attorneys and state's attorneys ""decide whether or not to investigate and ultimately charge those involved in police misconduct."" All are elected positions, Obama said, which usually suffer from ""pitifully low"" voter turnout, ""especially among young people — which makes no sense given the direct impact these offices have on social justice issues, not to mention the fact that who wins and who loses those seats is often determined by just a few thousand, or even a few hundred, votes."" Obama established a task force on ""21st-century policing"" in 2014 after Michael Brown's shooting death by police in Ferguson Mo., which led to violence there. Many police and criminal justice reforms outlined by Obama and his Justice Department have been abandoned during the Trump administration. President Trump has called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" and urged state and local governments to take aggressive action to quell any violent unrest. ",0.0

KTVB sent a crew to cover the rally and was told by an Idaho State Police officer that there were about over 300 people at the statehouse. Demonstrators carried signs like,""Black Lives Matter,"" and ""Legalize Being Black"" and took turns speaking from a megaphone.

Protests have erupted in dozens of cities over the past week since Floyd, a black man, died after a police officer was seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck for minutes on end. ""I think the public is getting to a place that it's never been before in understanding a lot of this,"" Biden said at the event. ""But it's going to take a whole hell of a lot of hard work. A lot of hard work. But I'm confident it can be done."" Fourteen faith leaders and local lawmakers attended the event at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Del., as they donned masks and sat seated two to a pew to help maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus. Biden spent more than half of the event listening to the concerns of community leaders rather than delivering remarks. He could be seen taking notes as each attendee got up and spoke. Despite being in a room full of supporters, the group offered critical feedback to the former vice president, with some saying the black community didn't get the economic boost it needed under the Obama administration and that Biden's role in passing the 1994 crime bill makes some young black voters skeptical of him. There were recommendations to create a czar dedicated solely to the study of police brutality within Biden's first 100 days as president. Several speakers urged Biden to pick an African American woman as his vice president. U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., spoke emotionally of a recent exchange she had with a 23-year-old protester in Wilmington, who told her he was ""willing to die."" ""He said, 'I have so much rage.' And I said, 'How old are you? What's your name? How old are you?' And I just tried to hold him, COVID or not,"" the congresswoman said. After about an hour, Biden rose to address the church gathering. ""I want to make something clear: I don't expect anything from the black community,"" he said. ""It has to be earned, earned every single time."" Biden said he's spent time speaking with black thought leaders about how to move forward as a country and said people who ""don't think of themselves as having a prejudiced bone in their body"" are now reckoning with the discrimination endemic in some American institutions. ""The Band-Aid's been ripped off by this pandemic and this president. No one can pretend any longer what this is all about. Nobody can pretend who has been carrying us on our backs — it's the minorities,"" Biden said. Biden listed specific plans for his would-be administration, including heightened federal oversight over local law enforcement, additional training for police officers and increased economic opportunity for African Americans. He teased the announcement of a new economic proposal in the coming weeks, which he said will have a strong emphasis on housing, education and access to capital. ""The ultimate answer for every other group has been access to economic opportunity,"" Biden said. ""What is the future? The future is you gotta be able to get out of bed and think, 'I can make it, I can do something. The deck's not completely stacked.' "" He also stressed what he characterized as a critical need to change leadership in the Senate, particularly as it relates to confirming federal judges. ""If we don't win back the United States Senate, we're going to be in real trouble,"" Biden said. ""Presidents come and go. But I tell you what, justices don't. They last a long time."" The event ended with a prayer and Biden saying he'll rely on the group for advice throughout his campaign. ""I know I'm going to make mistakes,"" he said before quoting the expression, ""What comes from the heart goes straight to the heart."" ""It's going to come from the heart. But I'll need help,"" the former vice president said. ""I need help and advice as we go along as to what you think I should and shouldn't be doing."" The event marked Biden's third public appearance in a week, his first trips away from his home since mid-March. He has been campaigning from his house due to coronavirus lockdown orders. Biden left his home on Memorial Day to lay a wreath at a veterans park near his home, and on Sunday he visited a site in Wilmington where protesters had gathered the night before in response to Floyd's death. Biden held a virtual meeting with mayors later in the day and had virtual fundraisers planned for Monday evening. ",0.0

Barr has directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to dispatch riot teams to the nation's capital and to Miami to assist local authorities in responding to protests there, according to a senior Justice Department official. The attorney general also sent an FBI hostage rescue team to help authorities Sunday in Washington with demonstrations, the official said, adding that the federal law enforcement presence will be ""maximized"" in the city on Monday evening. The moves come as protesters continue to take to the streets in cities across the country in outrage and grief over Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis while in police custody. Video of Floyd's arrest shows him handcuffed and pinned facedown on the street. A Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, is shown kneeling on top of him with his knee pushing on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Barr has called the outrage over Floyd's death ""real and legitimate"" but said the criminal justice system must be the venue to hold those responsible to account. And he argues that is already happening. Chauvin and three other officers involved have been fired from the police force. Minnesota authorities also have charged Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter. On a parallel track, the FBI and Justice Department are conducting a separate investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated. Some of the protests against Floyd's death have turned violent and destructive. Shops in Washington, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and elsewhere have been looted, burned and destroyed. Police stations and police vehicles have been attacked. It is unclear at this point who exactly is behind the violence, but Barr and President Trump put the blame squarely on what they have labeled far-left radicals and extremists. ""Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements,"" Barr said over the weekend. ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda."" He said that in many places, the violence appears to be driven by ""anarchistic and far-left extremists, using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence."" It is unclear what Barr meant by ""antifa-like tactics,"" and he did not offer any evidence to support his assertions. A Justice Department official later said it was based on information provided by state and local authorities. On Sunday, the president went a step further and threatened to designate antifa a terrorist group, although experts said there is no legal authority that allows a domestic entity to be labeled a ""terrorist organization."" On top of that, antifa, short for anti-fascist, isn't an organization but rather a diffuse movement of activists on the far left. While Barr and Trump have put the blame on them, some state authorities, such as Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, have blamed white nationalists. He, too, did not offer evidence to support his assertion. For now, state and local police and other authorities are leading the law enforcement response to the protests. They make the arrests, although the FBI is conducting interviews to determine whether any federal laws — such as crossing state lines to conduct violence —have been violated. ",0.0
1622664092,2020-06-01 17:48:07,Derek Chauvin: What we know about the former officer charged in George Floyd’s death,https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/06/derek-chauvin-what-we-know-about-the-former-officer-charged-in-george-floyds-death/,en,False,,247820,eastidahonews.com,http://eastidahonews.com/,"(CNN) — Derek Chauvin worked for the Minneapolis Police Department for more than 18 years. Then, within one week, he was filmed kneeling on George Floyd‘s neck for eight minutes before he died; fired from the police department; and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Throughout it all, protesters in Minneapolis and across the country demanded justice for Floyd and accountability for Chauvin. Chauvin is due to appear in court later this month. Here’s what we know about the veteran officer charged with Floyd’s death. He had 18 prior complaints against him Before he knelt on Floyd’s neck, Chauvin was the subject of 18 prior complaints filed against him with the Minneapolis Police Department’s Internal Affairs. Police confirmed the complaints were filed but didn’t detail why they were filed or what they entailed. Only two of the 18 complaints were “closed with discipline,” according to a MPD internal affairs public summary. In both cases, Chauvin received a letter of reprimand. According to Communities Against Police Brutality, a Minnesota nonprofit that created a database of complaints against officers in the state, Chauvin received oral reprimands for using a “demeaning tone,” “derogatory language” and other language that merited discipline. Neither the nonprofit database nor the Minneapolis internal affairs public summary include dates or descriptions that incited the complaints. Former officer Tou Thao, who was also involved in Floyd’s arrest, had six complaints filed with internal affairs, one of which was still open, the summary said. The other five were closed without discipline. The other two former officers, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane, had no complaints filed, according to a MPD internal affairs public summary. He and George Floyd once worked security shifts at the same nightclub Both men worked security at the El Nuevo Rodeo club, down the street from Minneapolis’ Third Precinct, former club owner Maya Santamaria told CNN. Floyd worked some Tuesdays as extra security. Chauvin worked as an off-duty police officer for the club for nearly 17 years, Santamaria said. “I wouldn’t characterize them as knowing each other,” she told CNN’s Josh Campbell in an interview. But, she added, “We all worked together certain nights and they would have crossed paths.” Santamaria said she couldn’t believe what she was seeing when she watched footage of the two employees, one under arrest and one face down on the pavement. “I kept yelling at my phone, telling Chauvin to get off of him. It’s horrible. It’s absolutely beyond words,” she said. “And having known Chauvin, I can’t believe he didn’t have the humanity to listen to this poor man begging for his air and his life.” His wife has filed to dissolve their marriage The day after Chauvin’s arrest, an attorney for his wife Kellie filed for a dissolution of marriage. “This evening, I spoke with Kellie Chauvin and her family. She is devastated by Mr. Floyd’s death and her utmost sympathy lies with his family, with his loved ones and with everyone who is grieving this tragedy. She has filed for dissolution of her marriage to Derek Chauvin,” a statement from Sekula Family Law office read. “While Ms. Chauvin has no children from her current marriage, she respectfully requests that her children, her elder parents, and her extended family be given safety and privacy during this difficult time.” The pair owns a townhouse in Windmere, Florida, Orange County property records show. Peaceful protests were held there before Chauvin’s arrest when it was rumored Chauvin had left Minnesota to hole up in Florida. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office said he wasn’t in the home and had no plans to be, and shortly thereafter, he was arrested in Minnesota. He is being held at a maximum-security prison Chauvin is being kept at Oak Park Heights state prison, the highest custody level in the Minnesota corrections system. “The move to DOC custody was made out of an abundance of caution to ensure he is safely held and after concern about space in the jail due to large numbers of arrests related to the unrest over the last few nights,” the state Department of Corrections said. There, he has access to phones and video visitations. In-person visits are not allowed because of Covid-19 concerns. The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

Police have cited concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. The rally has been held each year since 1990 to commemorate the lives lost in the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The Chinese military opened fire on citizens who were calling for economic and democratic reforms. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil, told the South China Morning Post that alliance members still planned to enter Victoria Park to observe a moment of silence that night. The alliance also asked the public to join an online gathering and light candles across the city. NPR's Emily Feng reported that the move to deny the demonstration comes amid controversy surrounding China's proposed national security law that could limit Hong Kong's autonomy. The potential law has concerned pro-democracy advocates, and as Feng noted, ""Legal scholars question whether Beijing has the authority to impose this law on Hong Kong."" In justifying an earlier extension of restrictions to June 4, police cited a lingering threat of the spread of the coronavirus, The Guardian reported. ""Police believe the event will not only increase participants' chances of contracting the virus, but also threaten citizens' lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others,"" police said, according to the newspaper. Lee Cheuk-yan, who chairs the alliance that organized the event, told the South China Morning Post that he believes the government was using the pandemic to shut down the demonstration. ""We believe this is totally unreasonable and unscientific, because everything is normal in Hong Kong. They are just using this excuse to suppress our rally,"" he said, adding that many other facilities had already reopened. ",0.0

But some health experts, even as they urge caution, said they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat. Tens of thousands of people, masked and unmasked, have thronged the streets of Minneapolis, Atlanta, Louisville, Ky., and other cities in the week since George Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. They are the largest public gatherings in the U.S. since the pandemic forced widespread shutdowns, and many local officials warned of a possible spike in new cases in one or two weeks. ""Risk of transmission is lower in open spaces, but wherever there is a gathering there is still the risk of transmitting the virus,"" said Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. Health experts urged protesters not to sing and shout to reduce the threat of person-to-person transmission. And they cautioned that police tactics such as tear gas and pepper spray could exacerbate the situation by prompting people to cough and gasp for air. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a list of tips for demonstrators to lower their risk of contracting COVID-19, such as covering their faces and staying in small groups. ""Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead,"" the department advised. Nsoesie said that while she agrees with the sentiment, ""I can see how some of these tips can be difficult to follow. For example, if you are angry or frustrated about an issue, you want to express that feeling, and speaking is one way of doing that."" She added, ""It's also hard to keep 6 feet of distance at a protest."" Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she's worried about how consecutive days of protests could trigger an influx of COVID-19 cases. Huge demonstrations began in the nation's capital on Friday — the same day Bowser lifted stay-at-home orders and eased shutdown rules. The city is still limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people. But in the streets around the White House, that cap is regularly exceeded by orders of magnitude. ""I'm so concerned about it that I'm urging everybody to consider their exposure if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested, because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve,"" Bowser said on NBC's Meet the Press. But the risks of congregating during a global pandemic shouldn't keep people from protesting racism, according to dozens of public health and disease experts who signed an open letter in support of the protests. ""White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,"" the letter said. Initially written by infectious disease experts at the University of Washington, the letter cited a number of systemic problems, from the disproportionately high rate at which black people have been killed by police in the U.S. to disparities in life expectancy and other vital categories — including black Americans' higher death rate from the coronavirus. ""Data is showing that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in many states,"" said Nsoesie, who was not among the letter's signatories when NPR contacted her. ""Racism is one of the reasons this disparity exists."" She continued, ""Racism is a social determinant of health. It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn't weigh these crises separately."" Local governments should not break up crowded demonstrations ""under the guise of maintaining public health,"" the experts said in their open letter. They urged law enforcement agencies not to use tear gas, smoke and other irritants, saying they could make people more susceptible to infection and worsen existing health conditions. The medical professionals also acknowledged the potential for COVID-19 cases to rise in the days to come, and they called for public health agencies to boost access to care and testing in affected communities.

Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One — Derek Chauvin — has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits."" : 6/03/20 A previous version of this Web story incorrectly said all four police officers present at the death of George Floyd are white. Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. AILSA CHANG, HOST: The viral video that sparked nationwide protests this weekend captured an individual tragedy - the death of a black man at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. But George Floyd's death is set against a backdrop of economic inequality that has long shadowed race relations in this country. We're going to talk about that now for a few minutes with NPR's Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So we've been hearing an enormous amount of frustration in the last week about yet another black man dying in police custody. Can you just break down for us how economics plays into that frustration? HORSLEY: There is certainly frustration with the deadly tactics of police. But there's also frustration about the underlying circumstances that in the richest country on Earth, a man could lose his life because he's suspected of passing a counterfeit 20-dollar bill. We know that African Americans are worse off than whites in this country by almost every economic measure. Andre Perry, who studies race and inequality at the Brookings Institution, says that means blacks in general are more vulnerable to any kind of economic downturn. ANDRE PERRY: Black folk live in communities where a single economic shock can really send the entire economic hopes astray. HORSLEY: And, of course, right now, we're all living through a giant economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. CHANG: Right. HORSLEY: People throughout the country are on edge. And that has just added more dry kindling to the woodpile where this match has landed. CHANG: Well, about the pandemic - I mean, we know that African Americans have suffered disproportionate health problems during this entire outbreak. But economically, how are they faring, relatively speaking, during this time? HORSLEY: Not well. Of course, workers of all races have seen a spike in unemployment during the pandemic. The black unemployment rate has jumped into double digits, as have other rates. But the black-white gap hasn't gotten noticeably worse during the last couple of months. CHANG: Interesting. HORSLEY: We do know, however, African Americans who are working are more likely to be in essential frontline jobs. And that puts them at greater risk of infection. CHANG: So how does Minneapolis, where this all started, stack up when it comes to inequality or when it comes to discrimination? HORSLEY: The racial divide in Minneapolis is pretty stark both in terms of income and homeownership. In fact, the gap between white and black homeownership in Minneapolis is one of the largest in the country. And that matters because for a lot of families, owning a home is the main building block of wealth and stability. If blacks aren't able to buy homes, they're missing out on an important stepping stone. Nationwide, African Americans did make some gains in homeownership in the '90s and early 2000s. But those were really wiped out by the subprime mortgage crisis. And Andre Perry says that kind of structural inequality feeds into the frustration of the people who are protesting George Floyd's death. PERRY: That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters. It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities. HORSLEY: Now, Perry notes these demonstrations are taking place five months before a national election. And he says this is a good opportunity for policymakers to talk about how they see policing and how they would address these longstanding economic challenges. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

Nelson, the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, issued the following statement Monday regarding current events in the United States. We join with many throughout this nation and around the world who are deeply saddened at recent evidences of racism and a blatant disregard for human life. We abhor the reality that some would deny others respect and the most basic of freedoms because of the color of his or her skin. We are also saddened when these assaults on human dignity lead to escalating violence and unrest. The Creator of us all calls on each of us to abandon attitudes of prejudice against any group of God’s children. Any of us who has prejudice toward another race needs to repent! During the Savior’s earthly mission, He constantly ministered to those who were excluded, marginalized, judged, overlooked, abused, and discounted. As His followers, can we do anything less? The answer is no! We believe in freedom, kindness, and fairness for all of God’s children! Let us be clear. We are brothers and sisters, each of us the child of a loving Father in Heaven. His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, invites all to come unto Him — “black and white, bond and free, male and female.” It behooves each of us to do whatever we can in our spheres of influence to preserve the dignity and respect every son and daughter of God deserves. Any nation can only be as great as its people. That requires citizens to cultivate a moral compass that helps them distinguish between right and wrong. Illegal acts such as looting, defacing, or destroying public or private property cannot be tolerated. Never has one wrong been corrected by a second wrong. Evil has never been resolved by more evil. We need to foster our faith in the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. We need to foster a fundamental respect for the human dignity of every human soul, regardless of their color, creed, or cause. And we need to work tirelessly to build bridges of understanding rather than creating walls of segregation. I plead with us to work together for peace, for mutual respect, and for an outpouring of love for all of God’s children.",0.0

She didn’t feel like she had the right words to share during a vigil for George Floyd which saw over 150 people in attendance. Floyd died after an officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota knelt on his chest and neck for nine minutes. As Kumire spoke into a microphone, emotion came over her while remembering Floyd and all the others who have died at the hands of police brutality. “It used to be a black problem,” Kumire said. “Now I think it’s everybody’s problem. All of us need to stand together and see what we can do to create change in the system.” Kumire led the crowd in a two minute and 58 second moment of silence, representative of how long an officer kneeled on Floyd after he was unresponsive. Ten minutes before the vigil, Kumire asked Richard Luvhengo, a junior studying Computer Information Technology, to be the second speaker. “I realized I have a responsibility to say something,” Luvhengo said. “I don’t want to remain silent.” While Kumire wasn’t expecting anyone to attend, Luvhengo was specifically surprised by the turn out from white people, including Rexburg Mayor, Jerry Merrill. Despite the event being organized too late to get a gathering permit, Mayor Merrill allowed it to go on as long as things remained peaceful. Luvhengo emphasized in his speech that it would not be a violent protest. “I came because I wanted to be supportive of their message,” Merrill said. “There are minorities in this country that definitely get treated wrongly. We need to make sure that everybody gets the love and respect that they deserve.” Merrill visited with the organizers to let them know that everyone in Rexburg is accepted. He asked the organizers if they feel comfortable in Rexburg, and according to Merrill they responded saying they “love Rexburg and feel great.” A protest in Salt Lake City, Utah turned violent yesterday with graffiti lining the buildings and cars overturned and burned. Utah Governor, Gary Herbert, activated the National Guard and set an 8 p.m. curfew for the city. Merrill was hopeful that things would remain peaceful in Rexburg but reached out to the police chief to make them aware of the vigil. According to Merrill, “They didn’t feel like they need to be here standing guard. “In Rexburg we just expect everybody to be respectful of everybody. Whether they’re black, white, brown, green or purple.” Andrea Radke-Moss, a BYU-Idaho professor in the History department, brought her family to the vigil to show support to the Black Lives Matter movement and to show her kids it’s important to stand up for the justice of others. “Supporting Black Lives Matter doesn’t mean that you don’t support police,” Radke-Moss said. “You can support police and hold them to a high standard of not using excessive force. I’ve known so many kids that have been the target of racism both here and in the church. I just feel like it’s important to draw attention to our problems of unconscious bias and unconscious racism.” Radke-Moss believes that a lot of students and faculty feel the way she does but is disappointed by the things she sees on the Rexburg community Facebook page, which indicates not everyone in the community shares those same sentiments.",0.0
1622707946,2020-06-01 10:41:36,Boise State football: The call-out and the response,http://rssfeeds.ktvb.com/~/625773306/0/ktvb/scottslant~Boise-State-football-The-callout-and-the-response,en,False,,25684,ktvb.com,http://www.ktvb.com,"Only one thing could pre-empt COVID-19 over the weekend, even in the sports world. Coaches have been compelled to speak, and Boise State’s did. BOISE, Idaho — Monday, June 1, 2020. Former Boise State safety Jason Robinson posted a Twitter video Saturday morning that was almost 15 minutes long, calling out coach Bryan Harsin for not making a statement about the unrest in America following the George Floyd killing. Robinson questioned Harsin’s support of his black players and suggested those players look at the transfer portal if they don’t feel that support. Harsin released a statement later in the day. It didn’t mention Floyd, nor race. But it was good, ending with: “The hate, the discord, the belief that voices are falling on deaf ears—it needs to change. Now. There is no place for it in our program, and it shouldn’t have a place in our society. We all need to be better, and it starts with each and every one of us caring for all we encounter regardless of color, politics or any other differences we might have.” Robinson contends that the success and growth of the city of Boise is “large in part due to the exposure that was given to the city by its football program,” pointing to the 2007 Fiesta Bowl as the flashpoint. “We’re talking about a football program that has had many, many, many African Americans come through and lend their talents to the Boise State brand,” said Robinson, naming a slew of black Broncos stars over the years. Their role in the rise of Boise State football is undeniable. Also undeniable is the fact that, although Bronco Nation appreciates and cares about these players, many fans don’t understand the challenges they’ve faced throughout their lives. It’s time to start. RICE CONTRIBUTES TO THE CONVERSATION Boise State men’s basketball coach Leon Rice released a statement Sunday night, and he drilled it down well. “We met this morning as a program, along with our families,” said Rice. “We are angry and sad,” Rice said. “There is no place in our communities for hatred or racism. The world is watching as each of us chooses how to respond in words and in actions. Rice finished with: “We can make a meaningful difference, and we are going to. Please join us in honoring the legacy of George Floyd and commit to action in your local communities.” CROWDED GROUP OF FIVE FIELD CBSSports.com rolled out its preseason top 25 (actually preseason top 130) over the weekend, and Boise State checks in at No. 22. The Broncos are one spot ahead of Air Force, the same way the two teams ended last season in the Coaches Poll. The CBS list is Group of Five-heavy, with Memphis tops at No. 16. Appalachian State is No. 19, Navy No. 20, and Cincinnati No. 21. Strength of schedule is as key as ever in the race for a New Year’s Six bowl. Five of the Mountain West’s 12 schools are ranked No. 101 or below: San Jose State, Colorado State, Fresno State, UNLV and New Mexico. The Broncos are scheduled to play four of them this season. JUSTINIAN BEFORE DERRICK The weekend started with ESPN updating its “Top 100 Best Available” list for the NBA Draft. Boise State proudly notes it is one of just 17 schools nationwide with multiple players on the list, including the only Mountain West program. But the players’ rankings don’t bode well for the NBA Draft. Justinian Jessup, at No. 92, is actually rated ahead of Derrick Alston’s No. 95. Jessup seems ticketed for overseas, while Alston is in Boise and participating in team activities despite declaring early for the draft. It’s looking more and more like Alston will be back. THIS DAY IN SPORTS…June 1, 1979: The Seattle Supersonics, led by Jack Sikma, Gus Williams, and Downtown Fred Brown off the bench, beat Washington, 97-93, to win the NBA Finals in five games. The Bullets were coached by Dick Motta, the pride of Fish Haven, Idaho, who guided Grace High School to the 1959 Idaho Class AA championship. It was the only NBA title for Seattle, which watched the Sonics become the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008.

Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after pleading for help as a former Minneapolis police officer used his knee on Floyd’s neck to pin him — unarmed and handcuffed — to the ground for nearly nine minutes. The incident began after Floyd allegedly tried to pay for something with a counterfeit bill. Video of the death has sparked outrage, protests and even riots across the country on Wednesday and Thursday, and the protests continued Friday. The Idaho Falls demonstration was organized by the Bonneville County Democratic Party.People who attended brought signs that read, “Black Lives Matter” and “Stop Killing Black People.” Brandon Grimsley, EastIdahoNews.com “The Bonneville County Democratic Party has always been in favor of equal rights for all,” Chairwoman Pat Tucker said. “We are not seeing the right to life equally applied to black men. We want to make the point unequivocally that here in Idaho Falls, we care about each and every life.” Tucker said the rally was held to raise awareness about institutional racism in the United States. She hopes to work with local law enforcement to combat institutional racism even here in eastern Idaho. “What happened to George Floyd cannot happen again,” she said. “It was murder for a nonviolent crime. Officers need to respond with minimal force.” Brandon Grimsley, EastIdahoNews.com Derek Chauvin, the fired Minneapolis police officer seen in a video with his knee on Floyd’s neck, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter on Friday.

Both times the protests began in anger over police violence against black men — in 1992, when four police officers were acquitted of the brutal beating of Rodney King; now, when George Floyd died in Minnesota after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. ""We keep telling ourselves that somehow technology or training will end police misconduct,"" says Jody David Armour, a law professor who studies the intersection of race and the criminal justice system. ""But in this case, we saw that in Minnesota, the police department did a lot of that stuff. And still here we are."" Armour, who has taught at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles since 1995, talked with All Things Considered about how protests have changed in the 28 years since the Rodney King riots. Interview Highlights On the people who are protesting now vs. in 1992 The protests and marches today you see are multiethnic, multicultural, even multigenerational. And the allyship is something that is more pronounced now than it perhaps once was. I think a lot of people, when they saw that video of George Floyd, who weren't in the black community, felt agony. And I think this time around, more people feel that sympathy and empathy for members of the black community and are standing in solidarity with them. On empathy for Rodney King vs. George Floyd I think at the time of the Rodney King beating it was easier to view it as an isolated incident or as a few bad apples. But now, over time, we see a persistent and pervasive pattern. Over years and years. We see Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, 25-year-old black man jogging and is shot dead. Two prosecutors look at the facts and don't bring any action. Breonna Taylor in Louisville. No-knock raid, wrong house; she's killed. The procession of hashtags that made up the Black Lives Matter movement in the 2014, 2015, 2016 years. I think more and more people are seeing that it isn't just isolated incidents, that there's something more pervasive and more ingrained in America that we have to address. The police officer's knee on the neck of George Floyd for many was a grim symbol of, kind of, America's knee on the neck of black America. On where broader protests go from here My sense of where the protests can go from here, hopefully will go from here, is we'll have a serious reckoning with the racial injustice that has really provoked and continues to provoke these kinds of eruptions. This is this really kind of a generational upheaval. We can either make some serious structural changes, redistribute power and wealth in a way that we haven't been willing to consider in the past. I think more people are willing to consider things like, even just as a result of the coronavirus crisis, things like universal basic income and ""Medicare for All."" I think that as a result of this other kind of crisis — I think that racism is a kind of virus, too, that mutates and changes from time to time, but continues to persist — that we will take on the necessary work of redistributing wealth and power in such a way that we don't have Skid Rows, 75% of which have black faces in them. That we don't make the faces at the bottom of the well always black faces. And we do start to act as a society like black lives matter. NPR's Jonaki Mehta and Sami Yenigun produced and edited the audio version of this interview. ",0.0

BOISE, Idaho — The death of George Floyd has sparked outrage across the nation, which has played out in violent protests. Leaders in Boise's black community you can have a direct impact in this anti-racism movement without putting yourself in harm’s way or adding to the chaos. ""I think ideally it would not be a good idea to go to a rally right now,"" said the Director of the Idaho Black History Museum Phillip Thompson. ""We're in the middle of a pandemic, there is too much going on, acts of violence, it is better not to."" Thompson said if people want to make a tangible difference in this anti-racism movement in the Treasure Valley community, consider donating to a social institution and earmark what you want that money going toward. ""The ACLU is a beautiful example that they can specifically help rectify misgivings in the judicial system that you can actually see make a change,"" Thompson said. He added often people blindly send their money to a non-profit without knowing how that money is being spent. ""Do you want to expose groups that typically aren't exposed to art to visit an art museum?"" he suggested. ""Perhaps you are going to donate for an art museum but earmark it for black kids, kids of color, kids from socio-economic disenfranchised areas to have a chance to come visit your museum and have it cover ten admissions."" Thompson added having a simple conversation with someone outside of your race or religion can also have a profound impact. ""Nine times out of ten, if you have a conversation with somebody one on one, you will expose them to new insights, as opposed to yelling at them and telling them how they are wrong,"" Thompson said. Another demonstration is planned to happen in Boise on Tuesday at 8:45 p.m. on the Idaho State Capitol Building steps.

In addition to multiple obscenities directed at police, the post encouraged participants to bring weapons including gas, tasers, baseball bats and pepper spray - ""anything to make damage."" ""With violence occurring throughout the country over the last several days, the post was taken very seriously and an investigation was launched into the post while also working with other law enforcement partners to prepare for a possible violent event,"" the department said in a statement.

Both were arrested for conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism and attempting to start a riot. ""At this point, there is no reason to believe that the juveniles involved conspired with terrorist or other radical organizations,"" the department said. As of 7 p.m. Monday, all was quiet in Jerome and there was no sign of pending unrest. Police said officers would remain vigilant and extra officers were patrolling the streets.

1622866610,2020-06-01 23:36:22,Gun Sales Continue To Boom During The Pandemic,https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/gun-sales-continue-boom-during-pandemic,en,False,,138019,boisestatepublicradio.org,http://boisestatepublicradio.org/,"Gun sales continued to boom in May, the third-straight month with a spike in estimated sales. Click 'play' to hear the audio version of this story. Americans bought more than 1.7 million firearms in May, according to estimates from industry analyst Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting. That is down from an estimated 1.8 million firearms in April, but an 80% year-over-year estimated increase. The FBI says it performed more than 3 million background checks in its NICS database in May, more than 700,000 more checks than it performed in May 2019. Many states run background checks on gun permit-holders, so background checks cannot be equated directly to gun sales. Guns sales began to skyrocket in March, apparently driven by fears of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales were up in April, too, according to SAAF estimates. Georgia State University Law Professor Timothy Lytton studies gun violence and says gun sales are likely being driven by two very different worries. Some people are concerned about heavy-handed government during a crisis and others are worried government services, like police, won’t be able to reach them. And he doesn’t see the trend in sales going away. “I think the current civil unrest is likely to stoke both of those fears even further and that we're likely to see increased sales of firearms continuing on through the summer,” Lytton said. Two-thirds of gun-owning Americans said in a 2017 study by the Pew Research Center that they own their guns for “protection.” Higher availability of guns could lead to an increase in violent crime like homicide, according to the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. Advocates and public health experts have also warned of the increased risk of domestic violence and suicide, especially in the midst of the pandemic. Lytton said one area of concern is the number of first-time gun buyers at a time when many don’t have access to safety training because of the pandemic. “One of the legacies of this that we might see is we might see additional firearms accidents or misuse of firearms by people who really aren't well-trained or equipped to use them,” he said. Most of the May sales were handguns, which are generally used for self-defense. In fact the ratio of handguns to long guns, like rifles, was the highest it has ever been in SAAF estimates, at nearly two to one. That ratio has been steadily climbing since the early 2000s. And, according to FBI numbers, the vast majority of background checks performed in May took place before protesters took to the streets across the country to protest police brutality after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

PORTLAND, Ore. — After three nights of unrest in downtown Portland, Mayor Ted Wheeler addressed the community Monday morning. He extended a curfew that's been in place since Friday and he reiterated U.S. Attorney Billy Williams' request for Gov. Kate Brown to activate the Oregon National Guard. Governors in 23 states and the mayor in Washington D.C. have brought in National Guard troops to help with civil unrest, with about 17,000 active troops nationwide. Wheeler said he asked Gov. Brown three times on Sunday for National Guard help, and that she offered alternatives. He asked again on Monday. When U.S. Attorney Williams was asked by a reporter during the Monday morning briefing whether activating the Oregon National Guard could exacerbate the situation, he said, ""That's always a potential, but at some point you have to do the right thing and right now our law enforcement partners are in desperate harms way. ""Is there a risk? Yeah, there's a risk everyday and sometimes you just have to accept it and draw a line in the sand and do everything you can to support law enforcement."" Wheeler later echoed the sentiment. ""I agree with what the U.S. Attorney said: We do need more resources, more people. I want to be clear to those who serve in the National Guard, I respect the difference between the mission of the National Guard and local issues,"" he said. ""If the National Guard is deployed, they'd protect facilities. Crowd control and policing will be left to law enforcement who are trained for that. The National Guard are our citizen soldiers. They're from here, live here."" On Sunday night, an estimated 6,000 protesters took to the streets in a peaceful demonstration. But at about 11:30 p.m. police said the protest had become an unlawful assembly and declared it a civil disturbance. ""Emotions are boiling over in the streets of America and in the streets of Portland,"" Mayor Wheeler said Monday morning. He said leaders are working as hard as they can to give protesters the right to assemble peacefully. ""They deserve to be heard. I am listening. Your police chief and fire chief are listening,"" he said. ""But last night a small number of demonstrators provoked conflict. ""Those who demonstrated peacefully, I want to say thank you. I'm proud to stand with you,"" he said. ""I do not believe violence or destruction is the answer to heal the deep racial wounds in America."" The mayor also said he looks forward to working alongside the phenomenal black leaders in Portland to find solutions to the inequities that have long targeted people of color. He said as long as the demonstrations continue, he will provide updates the following morning to let people know that Portland is a safe place. ""I've promised to keep creating space for black voices to be elevated and sacred,"" he said. ""We will continue to create that space until we have lasting change."" He reiterated that there were a few moments that gave him hope, like the scene of police officers kneeling with protesters in downtown Portland. Raw video: Portland police officers kneel with protesters Portland Police Deputy Chief Chris Davis said during the press conference that he saw people at their very worst, and at their very best. ""Our strategy was: Whatever happened, it would not be the police bureau that was the cause,"" he said. ""We saw broken glass at the Justice Center, then after that protesters threw projectiles at officers and very large mortars."" ""If you continue to demonstrate, do so peacefully,"" he said. ""This is your home, this is our home. Help us move our community in a positive direction."" Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese also spoke, saying looting, property damage and violence take away from our community's safety and our ability to move forward. ""The destruction in our community must stop,"" he said. ""I was personally there when our officers came under fire from projectiles, bottles and other items thrown at them. It was incredibly violent last night in front of the Justice Center at times."" He said police are actively looking for the people responsible for the damage at the Justice Center. Police have released photos of those suspects. Wheeler said the curfew will be in place Monday night and will be reassessed on a day-by-day basis.",0.0

PORTLAND, Ore. — A group of thousands of demonstrators in Portland peacefully protested the killing of George Floyd, the Minnesota black man who died in police custody after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, for hours on Monday night. After they disbanded on their own accord for the night, a clash between police and a separate, smaller group of about 100 protesters took place in the early hours of Tuesday morning around Southwest 4th Avenue and Salmon Street. The Portland Police Bureau said that clash, which lasted until about 1 a.m., involved protesters throwing projectiles, including glass bottles and rocks, at officers in downtown, prompting police to declare an unlawful assembly. One officer suffered minor injuries when they were hit by an object. Police said they used crowd control munitions to disperse the small group. Police tried to stop a woman who was driving through the streets handing out items to protesters but she fled, hitting several cars in the process. The woman was arrested after officers deployed spike strips to stop the driver near Southeast 14th Avenue and Franklin Street. One officer was injured during this incident. More than a dozen protesters were arrested into Tuesday morning and two firearms were seized. ""Thousands of demonstrators participated in an extensive march without engaging in violence or destructive behavior,"" said Portland Police Bureau Chief Jami Resch. ""Thank you for keeping this event peaceful. Your efforts to police the event yourselves created a safer environment for all. ""We will continue to arrest and hold responsible those who engage in acts of violence directed at the police, community members, or who commit other criminal acts,"" Resch said. While Monday night may have ended with that clash, the main protest group of the night remained peaceful during its hours-long demonstration. That group started the night on Portland’s eastside, marched across the bridge into downtown Portland, gathered outside the Multnomah County Justice Center and then packed into Pioneer Courthouse Square before heading back to the eastside where they disbanded near Revolution Hall at around 11:30 p.m. Lt. Tina Jones with the Portland Police Bureau said the demonstrators were self-policing and it made for a more peaceful atmosphere than previous nights. The group first met outside Revolution Hall in Southeast Portland and marched across the Burnside Bridge toward downtown. While on the bridge, they laid down in solidarity with George Floyd. Despite Mayor Ted Wheeler implementing an 8 p.m. curfew for the third night in a row, the demonstrators continued in downtown Portland where they at first gathered outside the Multnomah County Justice Center. There, a police liaison officer spoke with some of the demonstrators at their request. Jones said it was an opportunity for police to hear from demonstrators about the changes that need to be made to combat racial injustice. The group then packed into Pioneer Courthouse Square for an extended period of time before heading back to the Burnside Bridge and crossing over to Portland's eastside to the point where they began at Revolution Hall. At that point, protesters went their separate ways. Prior to Monday night's protest, the National Guard was called by Gov. Kate Brown to assist with Portland police. Jones said guard members would play a support role for the bureau's officers. Also prior to the demonstrations, police closed off a large section of downtown Portland, from Southwest 1st Avenue to 5th Avenue, and from Southwest Taylor Street to Jefferson Street. The closure was in effect for both drivers and pedestrians. Monday was the fourth night of demonstrations in Portland. Friday was by far the most violent, as rioters vandalized and set fires inside many buildings in downtown, including the Multnomah County Justice Center, which is home to many inmates. While those previous demonstrations ended with destruction, they were each preceded by hours of peaceful vigils and protests attended by thousands of Portlanders.",0.0

Protestors march through downtown Pullman alongside a car | Angela Palermo “I hope that you will all join us to peacefully demonstrate and send a message to the world that our community is here to support our (people of color) community members,” the Facebook event said. Samantha Fulgham, who organized the event via Facebook, said she wanted to create a safe space for people in the community who couldn’t make it to protests in Seattle, Portland or Spokane to share their experiences. She did not expect such a big turnout. Co-organizer of the event, Samantha Fulgham speaks to protestors outside Gladdish Community Center | Angela Palermo “I didn’t see anything being planned locally and I thought, ‘Wow, the people in this community may not have the opportunity to have their voices heard,’” Fulgham said. “The experiences of the black community — it is here. Our community is no different from any community in America experiencing police brutality.” Organizers of Pullman’s protest asked participants to stay six feet apart and wear personal protective equipment like masks and gloves. While almost no one maintained distance, most protestors wore masks and avoided touching others. Similar protests have erupted across the U.S. in response to the actions of a former Minneapolis police officercharged with the death of George Floyd, a black man. A protestor and their sign at Reaney Park in Pullman | Angela Palermo In a widely-circulated video initially posted to Facebook, Floyd can be seen handcuffed with his face pressed into the ground pleading “I can’t breathe” repeatedly before he eventually became unresponsive. Jesse Redheart, a Pullman resident, said his family prepared him for dangerous police interactions from a young age. “I remember being in high school, growing up in the inner city when the Trayvon Martin thing happened,” Redheart said. “The next night my mom had me and my brother, at a table, with a list of our rights and what we should do if cops are after us.” Jason Kennedy driving his car alongside protestors in downtown Pullman | Angela Palermo Redheart’s girlfriend, Avery Smalls, also came to the protest. Smalls is a Washington State University alumna from a black family. “We weren’t expecting this many people to show up. This is amazing,” Smalls said. “I’ve been crying just listening to people talk.” Floyd’s death May 25 struck a chord with many Americans, triggering a wave of frustration with police brutality that echoed across the globe. Large demonstrations have taken place in New York City, Los Angeles, Toronto, London, Berlin and dozens of cities in-between, according to a recent article from The New York Times. Protestor in Pullman carries her sign “This is America, black lives matter” | Angela Palermo Jason Kennedy, who helped organize the Pullman protest, wanted it to be peaceful to set an example. “We get riots when people don’t listen to the peaceful protests,” Kennedy said. “Martin Luther King said, ‘A riot is the language of the unheard.’ People haven’t been heard, so they’re speaking out.” Jason Kennedy addresses protestors at Reaney Park | Angela Palermo Pullman Police officer Todd Dow said the organizers of Pullman’s protest notified the department of the event in advance. “We’ll be close by in case something does happen,” Dow said. “Our plan really is just to give them space and let them do what they need to do.” Derek Chauvin, the white officer responsible for Floyd’s death, was captured on video pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 43 seconds, including nearly three minutes after he became unresponsive, according to a criminal complaint released by prosecutors Friday. A Protestor addresses the crowd at Reaney Park in Pullman | Angela Palermo Chauvin has since been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, according to Hennepin County attorney Mike Freeman. The other three officers involved, who failed to intervene or check Floyd’s pulse at any time, were fired but have not been arrested or charged. A Pullman resident who stumbled across Sunday’s protest, Nick Waltering, made a brief appearance to interrupt speakers at the event, calling BLM and its supporters racist. Waltering, a white man, said he was sitting at home in peace when he heard protestors chanting from afar. Nick Waltering (left) and Jason Kennedy (right) in an altercation at Reaney Park in Pullman | Angela Palermo “I am upset that all I hear is black lives matter, black lives matter, black lives matter,” Waltering said. “We all matter.” In a statement Friday, Pullman Police Department Chief Gary Jenkins condemned the actions of the Minneapolis police officer responsible for Floyd’s death. Protestors march past Palouse Games in Pullman | Angela Palermo “Not only are we disgusted by the actions of the officer directly responsible for the death of Mr. Floyd, but also by the lack of intervention by the other officers who, by simply standing by, were complicit in his death,” the release said. “Those who are complicit in incidents like this must also be held accountable.” In the last year alone, police officers in the U.S. killed 1,099 people, according to data compiled by Mapping Police Violence, a research and advocacy group. In the same study, black people were 24% of those killed despite being only 13% of the population. Protestors march back towards Gladdish Community Center | Angela Palermo KT Turner, a graduate student at the University of Idaho, said that when she moved to Moscow she knew she would be one of few people of color. “Seeing everybody out here today, seeing that people actually care and that I’m not alone — I feel a little safer,” Turner said.

In recent years, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the face of the movement. In 2016, he began kneeling before games, during the playing of the national anthem, to protest police treatment of minorities and social inequality. Since last week's death of George Floyd, an African American man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck, there's been a surge of sports figures speaking out. Some have even joined demonstrations that have swept the nation. True to its status as the most politically progressive of this country's major sports, the NBA has had many players and officials lend their voices – from Commissioner Adam Silver to Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James to legendary Lakers center and longtime political activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who wrote about what he believes is the motivation behind the widespread protests. ""The black community is used to the institutional racism inherent in education, the justice system and jobs,"" Abdul-Jabbar said in a Los Angeles Times essay last weekend. ""And even though we do all the conventional things to raise public and political awareness ... the needle hardly budges."" He added, ""Yes, protests often are used as an excuse for some to take advantage, just as when fans celebrating a hometown sports team championship burn cars and destroy storefronts. I don't want to see stores looted or even buildings burn. But African Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you're choking on it — until you let the sun in."" Even Michael Jordan weighed in publicly, which to many was a surprise. The recent 10-part ESPN documentary, The Last Dance, lionized the legendary Chicago Bulls star, although it touched on a few perceived shortcomings, including what some see as Jordan's unwillingness to speak out on political issues. ""I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in,"" Jordan said in the documentary, adding, ""but I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player. ""I wasn't a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That's where my energy was."" But now Jordan is speaking out, an indication of how deeply Floyd's death has resonated. ""I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,"" Jordan said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough."" There have been other heartfelt, and perhaps surprising, shows of solidarity. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz also has been largely apolitical in his four years in the NFL. But last week, Wentz was one of the first prominent white athletes to speak out. ""Being from North Dakota, I've spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I'm never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through,"" Wentz said on Twitter. ""I'll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color. ... ""I don't understand the society we live in that doesn't value all human life. It's heartbreaking and disturbing. My prayers go out to every man, woman and child that has to endure the effects of the racism in our society."" Former and current African American teammates praised Wentz. ""You didn't have to say a thing but you did,"" former Eagles receiver Torrey Smith tweeted, adding, ""Love you bro."" Traditionally, Major League Baseball has, as a sport, avoided politics. Not now. A number of big leaguers have weighed in, including Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle. He's white, and he offered historical context in a tweet with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. ""Racism is America's Original Sin,"" Doolittle wrote. ""It was here before we even forged a nation, and has been passed down from generation to generation. And we still struggle to acknowledge that it even exists, much less atone for it. The generational trauma of racism and violence is killing black men and women before our eyes. ... ""We must not look away from the racism and violence. ... We must take action and call it out for what it is. We must recognize our shared humanity and atone for our Original Sin, or else we will continue to curse future generations with it. ""RIP George Floyd."" Still silence Even though the current environment seems to encourage sports figures to speak out, there's also notable silence coming from the sports world. So says LeVelle Moton. Moton is the men's basketball head coach at North Carolina Central University. He said white basketball and football coaches from the most prominent college conferences in the nation — the Power Five — are not speaking up. And he said he believes they should be. In fact, he said, they're obligated to do so. ""The reality is, a lot of these coaches have been able to create generational wealth,"" Moton told ESPN Radio. ""Their grandkids' kids are gonna be able to live a prosperous life because athletes who were the complexion of George Floyd were able to run a football, throw a football, shoot a basketball or whatever have you, so they have benefited greatly from athletes that look like George Floyd and many more. But whenever people the complexion of George Floyd are killed, assassinated, murdered in the street in broad daylight, they're silent."" Not all. Prominent white college basketball coaches have spoken out against Floyd's death, including the University of Kentucky's John Calipari, Roy Williams of the University of North Carolina and Michigan State University head coach Tom Izzo. Nick Saban is the most famous active head coach in Division 1 college football. He also released a statement about Floyd. ""We're at an important moment for our country,"" the University of Alabama coach said in a message that cited civil rights icons Rosa Parks and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., ""and now is the time for us to choose kindness, tolerance, understanding, empathy, and most importantly ... it's time to love each other. Every life is precious, and we must understand we have so many more things that unite us than divide us."" Still, the complexity of Kaepernick Sunday's Houston Chronicle sports section went beyond the myriad athlete and coach statements of grief and resolve. It took a strong stand with a full-page editorial statement. The page had a picture of Floyd at the top and a kneeling Kaepernick at the bottom. In between, a section read, ""Imagine, if we had embraced Colin Kaepernick's peaceful protest and paid attention to the issue he was trying to address."" It wasn't the only connector between Floyd and Kaepernick. A dramatic meme circulating since Floyd's death shows a picture of the Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, next to a picture of Kaepernick kneeling in protest. The visuals have stirred up the not-too-distant memory of Kaepernick's protest, which began in 2016, and was politicized from the beginning. And it's prompting harsh criticism of the NFL, even as the league joins the massive sports outpouring of grief and anger. Last weekend, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement offering condolences to Floyd's family as well as those of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, young African Americans also killed in recent high-profile cases. ""These tragedies inform the NFL's commitment and our ongoing efforts,"" Goodell said, adding, ""There remains an urgent need for action. We recognize the power of our platform in communities and as part of the fabric of American society. We embrace that responsibility and are committed to continuing the important work to address these systemic issues together with our players, clubs and partners."" Critics blasted Goodell for what they called hypocrisy. ""Colin Kaepernick asked the NFL to care about the lives of black people and they banned him from their platform,"" said Michael-Shawn Dugar, an NFL writer for The Athletic. Instead of prompting a discussion about police treatment of minorities and social inequality, Kaepernick's protests prompted a debate about patriotism and the flag, fueled by President Trump, who used an expletive to describe Kaepernick and other players who joined the pregame protests. Even though the NFL ultimately endorsed social justice initiatives, Kaepernick still is considered a pariah — no NFL owner has hired him. And with the league dealing with a significant lack of diversity in important head coaching and general manager positions, Goodell's critics said his reference to the league's ""commitment and our ongoing efforts"" is insincere. On their face, Goodell's words seemed in lockstep with much of the rest of the sports world as it grapples with and grieves over Floyd's death. But for many, the renewed attention on Kaepernick and his experience present just as powerful a message about the powerful NFL, where, in the volatile realm of race and justice, words appear louder than actions.

But several states and the District of Columbia have primaries up and down the ballot: Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail by one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He went into the day 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to get. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote, with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary, with its 186 delegates). Rep. Steve King on the ropes. The controversial Iowa conservative faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who has painted King as ineffective in the House, given that he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. Former state Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face either state Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks or ex-Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling, who moved to Iowa in 2017. Miller-Meeks got the backing of Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, have backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces a challenge from the left. A veteran lawmaker from Maryland's 5th Congressional District and No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, Hoyer faces a progressive primary challenge from 29-year-old Mckayla Wilkes. Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment has remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He has outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET Loading... Spy games in New Mexico. The announced retirement of New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall set off a domino effect. Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Luján declared for Udall's Senate seat, leaving open his seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Enter: Valerie Plame, the ex-CIA agent. She has raised and spent more than any candidate in this race and gained national attention with her glossy campaign ad showing her racing backward in a Chevy Camaro on a dusty road. But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take on Torres Small this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It has been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase has outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... Senate matchups to be set in Iowa and Montana. Democrats are hoping to take back the Senate this fall. They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired Adm. Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach who has spent the second most — $1.4 million — on this primary. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... When Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock changed his mind and decided to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, it suddenly put this race on the map for Democrats in a big way. Three other Democrats are on the ballot Tuesday, but Bullock has been expected to win easily, raising more than 10 times what his next opponent has. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Indiana openings. The retirements of moderate Democrat Pete Visclosky in Indiana's 1st District and Republican Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in Congress, in the 5th District has opened up both of these ideologically divergent seats. More than half a dozen Democrats are competing in the 1st District, which is suburban and exurban Chicago, a place that went for Hillary Clinton with 54% of the vote in 2016. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET Loading... In the 5th District, a handful of Republicans have duked it out, including state Sen. Victoria Spartz, who raised and spent the most and got the backing of the Club for Growth, and Beth Henderson, a local businesswoman with the endorsement of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun. Democrats have rallied around one candidate, Christina Hale. This district has been in GOP hands for a long time, but it could be one to watch this fall. The Cook Political Report lists it as only ""lean Republican."" Trump won it with 53% in 2016.

To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. NOEL KING, HOST: Last night, President Trump made a threat. He said if states don't figure out a way to stop unrest, he will send in the military. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. KING: NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman has been looking into this. Good morning, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: The president sometimes just says stuff. But this is a serious thing that he said last night. Do we know if and when he might really do it? BOWMAN: No, we don't. And, as you say, you know, he'll say all sorts of things. This appears to be more bluster on the part of the president, quite frankly, and trying to score political points. He's been very critical of the governors, especially democratic ones, saying they're weak, not doing enough to deal with the protests that have gone violent. But the governors are calling out their National Guard in large degree. Twenty-three states are using their Guard for a total of 17,000 Guard troops, and more may be called up to deal with any lawlessness. And the Guard troops are assisting local law enforcement in everything from transportation, logistics and in the more traditional law enforcement activities like partnering with police on patrols. But again, this is all at the state level with no federal involvement at this point. KING: Right, which raises this really interesting question. Does President Trump actually have the authority to deploy troops other places? BOWMAN: He does have that authority under the Insurrection Act from the early 1800s, which basically says a president can send in active-duty troops into a state if the laws are not being enforced, including the civil rights of residents. Now, Eisenhower did it in the 1950s in Arkansas to enforce school desegregation against the wishes of state officials. But the last time, Noel, the Insurrection Act was used was in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots that followed Rodney King's beating. But that was when Governor Pete Wilson requested federal troops from President George H.W. Bush. So it almost always makes sense to have the support of local officials. And in Washington, D.C., the leaders there have requested more National Guard troops from out of state. And those Guard troops started coming in late last night. And there are some active-duty military police on standby now outside the city. But we're told by Pentagon officials they most likely will not be needed because of those additional Guard troops, as well as federal law enforcement officials. KING: So those pictures we saw out of D.C. last night, those were all National Guard? BOWMAN: Right, National Guard, D.C. National Guard, as well as, again, a lot of federal law enforcement personnel as well. Now, D.C. has called up its entire 1,200 National Guard contingent, which is, again, why officials say they need more Guard troops. And again, those additional Guard troops - hundreds of them - started coming in late last night from a number of states, including New York and New Jersey. KING: NPR's Tom Bowman. Thanks, Tom. BOWMAN: You're welcome, Noel. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0
1623204434,2020-06-02 05:57:00,Governors Push Back On Trump's Threat To Deploy Federal Troops To Quell Unrest,https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/governors-push-back-trumps-threat-deploy-federal-troops-quell-unrest,en,False,,138019,boisestatepublicradio.org,http://boisestatepublicradio.org/,"Updated at 10:33 a.m. ET President Trump, in a conference call Monday with the nation's governors, threatened to deploy the U.S. military to restore order unless states hit by days of unrest ""put down"" violent demonstrations, urging leaders to ""dominate"" lawbreakers or risk looking like ""a bunch of jerks."" The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you; you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" ""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard."" ""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly."" Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal."" ""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way."" In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

1623204430,2020-06-02 06:08:00,What We're Reading About The Past Week Of Protests,https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/what-were-reading-about-past-week-protests,en,False,,138019,boisestatepublicradio.org,http://boisestatepublicradio.org/,"If you've been trying to keep up with news about the nationwide protests against police brutality, the stream of stories can be overwhelming. In the days following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody, reporters have been covering the protests in more than 140 cities across the country, trying to make sense of this tumultuous moment. Here are some of the most illuminating stories that we've read this week to help us understand how we got here, and the larger issues driving the protests. Minneapolis in context This is hardly the first time that Minneapolis has erupted into protests about police brutality and the killings of black people. In 2016, people took to the streets after police shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in a nearby suburb, Falcon Heights. And in 2015, Minneapolis police shot and killed Jamar Clark, which ignited two weeks of protests. In the Boston Review, Elizabeth Hinton relates the current protests in Minneapolis to the ones that followed the deaths of Clark and Castile. She also looks at the nationwide unrest that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Similar to the uprisings that took place more than half a century ago, she writes, Minneapolis residents are fed up with the ""buildup of unanswered grievances and the lack of concrete changes to their immediate living conditions."" ""Rather than responding to violent political rebellion with policy—such as addressing mass unemployment, failing public schools, and inhumane housing conditions—policymakers and officials, from Richard Nixon's War on Crime to the bipartisan War on Drugs to Donald Trump's embrace of 'Law and Order' politics, have consistently sought to manage the material consequences of socioeconomic problems (e.g., urban decay and drug abuse) with more police, more surveillance, and, eventually, more incarceration. We as a nation still fail to reckon with the wisdom King prophetically offered toward the end of his life: that only 'social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention. There is no other answer. Constructive social change will bring certain tranquility; evasions will merely encourage turmoil.' "" Policing Over at Slate, Joel Anderson writes that while many police chiefs are condemning the excessive use of force by the police officer who killed Floyd, it's important to pay attention to what police are doing during protests: ""The initial response of police leaders may have felt like progress, but video footage of police and protesters clashing in the streets reveals the truth: Officers are much closer to what we see in viral videos documenting their brutality than in the well-intentioned words of their leaders. Despite the shift in public statements, police haven't changed since the protests of 2014 and 2015."" Many protesters, including journalists, have captured police on tape pointing guns, shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at them. Matthew Dessem compiled a list at Slate of the ways police incited violence: ""Police all over the country tear-gassed protesters, drove vehicles through crowds, opened fire with nonlethal rounds on journalists or people on their own property, and in at least one instance, pushed over an elderly man who was walking away with a cane."" Existing while black The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging during the protests, and as we've reported, black people are dying from the virus at disproportionate rates. And as Annalisa Merelli at Quartz writes, police brutality is also a public health crisis that affects black people at a much higher rate than others: ""To give a sense of the magnitude of the crisis, the APHA reported that in 2016 alone (the latest year for which the organization could get reliable data, in itself a telling sign of the lack of priority accorded to the issue) at least 1,019 people were killed due to police intervention, and 76,440 were injured. This resulted in nearly 55,000 years of life lost, and had a large price tag, too: Police brutality costs $1.8 billion per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control's most recently available data (2010)."" Many argue that these two crises for the black community — police brutality and the coronavirus — aren't independent of each other. In fact, in both cases, the extent of the death toll stems from systemic discrimination, and in both cases, the solution may require a deep rethinking of the overall system. In The Atlantic, Ibram X. Kendi examines an 1896 document by a statistician that says black people were naturally selected for disease and death, and would gradually become extinct. Kendi goes on to write that ""too many Americans have been waiting for black extinction since Hoffman,"" and that black Americans are ""living in a nightmare"" rather than the elusive American dream: ""A nightmare is essentially a horror story of danger, but it is not wholly a horror story. Black people experience joy, love, peace, safety. But as in any horror story, those unforgettable moments of toil, terror, and trauma have made danger essential to the black experience in racist America. What one black American experiences, many black Americans experience. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the toil and terror and trauma of other black Americans. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the souls of the dead. Because they know: They could have been them; they are them. Because they know it is dangerous to be black in America, because racist Americans see blacks as dangerous."" Stories of solidarity Our NPR colleague Leila Fadel wrote about a Somali immigrant, Safia Munye, who opened a restaurant in Minneapolis more than two years ago — only to close her doors because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the community rallied behind her business and raised more than $180,000 to reopen this weekend — that is, until it was burned down during the protests. But despite her loss, Munye says she wants justice for Floyd and change for Minneapolis. "" 'My heart is broken. My mind is broken,' she says. 'I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice.' "" And The New York Times brought us another story about resilience and solidarity, about a Bangladeshi family in Minneapolis who also lost their restaurant after it was burned down during one of the protests. Yet they support the uprising, and even opened the restaurant's doors as a medical haven for protesters. "" 'We were just trying to do what we could to help our community,' said [Hafsa] Islam, who helped treat wounded protesters. 'Sure, we had our business. Sure, we were trying to keep our kitchen open. But more than anything, we were concerned for our people.' ""The tension in [Ruhel] Islam's adopted city reminds him of his childhood in Bangladesh, when he lived through a dictatorship. Two of his fellow students were killed by the police, he said. 'We grew up in a traumatic police state, so I am familiar with this type of situation,' he said.""

Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful. But looting and vandalism in some areas along Van Nuys Boulevard prompted a response from officers, who fired bean bags. Authorities also responded to a fire at a strip mall, according to the Los Angeles Times. San Francisco Bay Area Some 15,000 people marched peacefully in downtown Oakland, according to a police spokesperson quoted in the East Bay Times. Most dispersed prior to the start of the city's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. More than 40 people were arrested for violating the curfew, according to the Oakland Police Department. The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said. Police said some protesters had vandalized a handful of vehicles, according to NPR member station KQED. More than a dozen San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions have imposed curfews in the wake of protests sparked by Floyd's death. Corrections: 6/02/20 A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that 15,000 people marched on Interstate 680 in Walnut Creek, Calif., and were dispersed by police.

""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. ""More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that's what the presidency is: the duty to care — to care for all of us."" On Monday evening, Trump walked from the White House across Lafayette Square to hold a Bible in front of St. John's Church, after peaceful protesters were forcibly cleared from the park. (The U.S. Park Police say they used smoke canisters, not tear gas, though it's not clear if another law enforcement agency engaged there used other munitions.) The forceful dispersal began before the Washington, D.C., curfew had begun, and the bishop overseeing the church has harshly criticized Trump for appearing for photos without praying or addressing the racial issues at the heart of nationwide protests. Trump made the trip after making a speech in which he threatened to deploy the military to states and cities that do not quell violence. ""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it,"" Biden said. ""If he opened it, he could have learned something: that we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump isn't interested in doing that work."" Biden echoed the words spoken by George Floyd, the black man whose death while in custody of Minneapolis police has led to the widespread unrest. The words ""I can't breathe,"" Biden said, ""are a wake-up call for our nation."" Biden addressed police abuses and economic disparities that affect what he called ""communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time"" — alluding to the since-charged police officer who had his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. ""The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism,"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said. He asked Congress to take up measures he called ""a down payment on what is long overdue,"" including police reform bills outlawing chokeholds, banning the transfer of military weapons to police forces and establishing a uniform use of force standard. He said he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president. Biden also called for expanding the Affordable Care Act to millions more Americans, saying that Trump, who has long opposed the law, is ""consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to [former President] Barack Obama."" Obama's former vice president reiterated what he has long said on the 2020 campaign trail, that there is a ""battle for the soul of America."" ""Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears,"" Biden said. ""He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being that he leads. ""The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either,"" Biden said. ""But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate."" In a statement following his remarks, Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign adviser, said Biden has ""obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy."" She added: ""Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has used the politics of racial division when they suited his needs and he is doing it again."" On Monday, Biden held his first in-person campaign event since the coronavirus took hold in the United States in mid-March. He met with African American faith leaders in Wilmington, Del., listening to at-times critical feedback from the group. Many of the invited guests chided Biden for a political system that has delivered ""hopelessness"" to young African Americans. They told him the Obama administration had not done enough to economically lift black Americans, something Biden then promised would be a centerpiece of any recovery plan from the administration.

The bishop who oversees St. John's is among the critics. ""He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR's Morning Edition. ""He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation."" ""He did not pray,"" the bishop continued. ""He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate ... represent."" Every president since James Madison has visited St. John's Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday's visit. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" Budde told NPR's Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. ""I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,"" the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John's a few minutes after Washington's just-installed 7 p.m. curfew began. The federal force used against the demonstrators nearly 30 minutes before the curfew began incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""Shameful!"" Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after ""federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,"" the city's police force's job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult. I imposed a curfew at 7pm. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House, an act that will make the job of @DCPoliceDept officers more difficult. Shameful!  DC residents — Go home. Be safe — Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MurielBowser) June 2, 2020 When the federal force rushed at protesters outside the White House, journalists were also pushed out. Officers attacked Australian reporter Amelia Brace and also hit cameraman Tim Myers, prompting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to call for an investigation. The scene played out on live TV, during Australia's breakfast-time Sunrise show. ""While live on air, Myers was struck in the chest by a riot shield and Brace was clubbed with a police baton,"" Australia's 7NEWS reports. ""Our Ambassador should be certainly making representations on behalf of these Australians who effectively been assaulted...for doing their job"" - Leader of the @AustralianLabor Party @AlboMP speaking after @Channel7 journalist & cameraman were hit. https://t.co/rCG56KbYRw #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/CUslYLfYes — 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) June 2, 2020 Brace tells Australia's ABC that she repeatedly identified herself as a journalist as officers quickly closed in on them during the rush to clear a path for Trump. ""Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,"" she says. ""We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to ... and then we ended up getting tear-gassed."" The situation, she said, was ""absolutely terrifying."" ""I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we'll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we're feeling perfectly safe,"" Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, ""Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously."" Trump's use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation's capital. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" ""All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,"" Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement. While Budde is thankful to first responders who put out that fire, she says she wants the focus to remain on the death of George Floyd and others who have died at the hands of police. ""I want to acknowledge the loss of property, but in no way equate it with the loss of life,"" she said. ""I want to be a church that stands in solidarity with those who are making peaceful protest."" : 6/01/20 An earlier version of this Web story mistakenly said that President Trump walked to St. John's Church nearly 30 minutes before Washington's 7 p.m. curfew began. In fact, he walked there a few minutes after the curfew began.",0.0

Some city leaders now worry such gatherings could lead to new outbreaks of COVID-19.  Denver Mayor Michael Hancock announced Sunday that the city will be offering free tests to demonstrators.  ""We did see and have witnessed people demonstrating in our community – peacefully, as well as after hours when it's not so peaceful – without face coverings, and so we want to remind everyone and invite you that next weekend, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, go down to the Pepsi Center and get tested for COVID-19 for free,"" said Hancock. ""It's free, it is quick, it is painless and at least we can use that opportunity to make sure that we continue to blunt the spread of the coronavirus.""  A spokesperson with the city says people would not need to declare – or prove – they'd been at a protest in order to qualify for testing, but that they would need to register online and provide a name and address.  As Dr. Emily Landon, a hospital epidemiologist and infectious diseases specialist at University of Chicago Medicine, told NPR, it takes at least three to five days after exposure before a nasal swab test will be able to pick up on an infection. Denver's testing event fits with that window, as it begins five days after Sunday's demonstration. Protests are expected to continue this week. City officials in other places, like Atlanta and New York, are also encouraging protesters to get tested for COVID-19. New York City's health department offered tips for protesters on how to avoid spreading COVID-19:  Plan to protest? Here are tips to reduce the risk of spreading #COVID19: ✔️Wear a face covering ✔️Wear eye protection to prevent injury ✔️Stay hydrated ✔️Use hand sanitizer ✔️Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead ✔️Stick to a small group ✔️Keep 6 feet from other groups— nychealthy (@nycHealthy) May 30, 2020 As The Verge pointed out, law enforcement's handling of the events could make the complicated task of contact tracing even more difficult than usual: ""People who test positive for the coronavirus may be reluctant to tell health officials if they were at protests because they may worry about retaliation. They might not want to identify people they interacted with at the protests for the same reasons. That's just one way mistrust makes it difficult for public health officials to track down clusters of COVID-19.""  According to Dr. Jonathan Samet, dean of the Colorado School of Public Health, there's roughly a 13-day lag between when someone gets infected with COVID-19 and when they may need to be hospitalized for it. Dean is an epidemiologist who has been working with the state's health department to model its COVID-19 outbreak.  Like police brutality, the virus has disproportionately affected people of color.

By the time the workers paused Tuesday morning, little was left of a spire that had become a lightning rod for controversy in recent years and a focal point for local protesters outraged by George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis. On Sunday, the obelisk — known formally as the Confederate Sailors and Soldiers Monument — was the site of a speech from Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, who pleaded with the crowd. Some protesters had already vandalized the monument and toppled another statue in the park, that one of former Confederate officer Charles Linn. Woodfin asked that demonstrators refrain from trying to tear down the much larger monument — so that his government could do it instead. ""Allow me to finish the job for you,"" the mayor told a crowd behind his mask and a megaphone. And he persuaded them to give him until midday Tuesday to pull the monument down. ""I wanted you to hear it directly from me. But I need you to stand down."" On Monday, Woodfin declared a state of emergency and implemented a curfew for the city, citing the previous night's protests during which police arrested at least two dozen people. Birmingham isn't the only city reckoning with its Confederate past in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Since the release of a video showing the black man's arrest in Minneapolis, during which a white officer plants a knee on Floyd's neck, protesters in several cities and towns below the Mason-Dixon Line have directed their frustration — and sometimes vandalism — toward local Confederate monuments. In Alexandria, Va., a statue commemorating Confederate soldiers came down Tuesday morning. It was removed a month earlier than scheduled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy due to fears of vandalism, according to The Washington Post. Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving. pic.twitter.com/CZTjlOkpfT — Justin Wilson (@justindotnet) June 2, 2020 This week's move likely isn't the final chapter in the Birmingham monument's story, which was knotty well before the latest spasm of unrest trained attention back on it. Woodfin's predecessor, William Bell, ordered the memorial partly hidden with plywood screens in 2017 following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued the city, citing a violation of a state law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, which protects against the relocation or alteration of Confederate symbols that have been up for more than four decades. A unanimous state Supreme Court decision last fall sided with the monument's supporters, bringing the plywood down and assessing a fine of $25,000 against the city of Birmingham. Now Marshall has threatened another lawsuit over the city's move. ""Should the City of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today,"" the attorney general said in a statement issued Monday, ""city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the [Alabama Memorial Preservation] Act to pursue a new civil complaint against the City.""

On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee begins the first of a planned series of hearings on the origins of the FBI's 2016 Russia investigation into possible ties with the Trump campaign. Republicans are particularly interested in the decision-making inside the Obama-Biden administration. Further, the Senate Homeland Security Committee late last month approved a subpoena along party lines for Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. ""The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the U.S. who is currently trying to be president got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $80,000 a month,"" said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, accused the committee's chairman, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., of abusing his power to aid Trump. ""We're in the middle of the worst public health and economic crisis in a century,"" he said, ""and what is Senator Johnson focused on? Running a political errand for Donald Trump by wasting Homeland Security Committee time and resources attempting to resurrect a craven, previously-debunked smear against Vice President Biden."" It is the allegation at the heart of Trump's impeachment — the president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and conspiracy theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and in December 2019, Trump was impeached for abuse of power by the House of Representatives for making the ask. The Senate acquitted the president in February after a contentious trial. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans using the Senate to try to help get Trump reelected. ""There are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee's attention but instead this committee is doing the president's personal bidding,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a potential contender to be Biden's running mate. During the first Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, senators will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., plans to subpoena 53 individuals, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former director of national intelligence James Clapper — all frequent Trump political targets. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had generally avoided weighing in on these investigations, but he fully embraced them in a recent Senate floor speech. ""No matter what some Washington Democrats may try to claim, you are not crazy or a conspiracy theorist if you see a pattern of institutional unfairness towards this president. You would have to be blind not to see one,"" he said. Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley, who testified against Trump's impeachment in the House, said investigations can be political and still have merit. ""I certainly believe that the oversight interests are stronger when you're looking at things like the Russia investigation. The Burisma controversy presents a more challenging question, however, I tend to favor some inquiry."" As vulnerable House Democrats experienced during impeachment, high-profile partisan inquiries can spark political backlash when voters have more urgent concerns — like the pandemic, the economy and social unrest. Graham was quick to announce last Friday that the Senate Judiciary Committee would also hold a hearing on police use of force. Democratic strategist Scott Mulhauser is a former Biden aide, and a former Senate aide. He said Senate Republicans — who are fighting to hold their majority this November — could be making a political blunder. ""It's an overreach here, an overplay of your hand with these hearings. Taking your eye off the ball is a mistake that could cost careers."" Graham says he would like to issue a committee report by October, ahead of Election Day.  Copyright 2020 NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK SCOTT: The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the United States, who is currently trying to be president, got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $30,000 - or $80,000 a month. DAVIS: Florida Senator Rick Scott joined every Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month to vote for a subpoena of Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. A spokesman for the Biden campaign has accused Republicans of, quote, ""running a political errand"" for the president. This allegation is at the heart of Trump's impeachment. The president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and unfounded theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and Trump was impeached for abuse of power for making the ask. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans now using the Senate to try to boost Trump's reelection chances. Here's California Senator Kamala Harris. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: There are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee's attention. But instead, this committee is doing the president's personal bidding. DAVIS: Today, in the Judiciary Committee, Republicans hold their first oversight hearing into the decision-making process inside the Obama-Biden administration around the FBI investigation of Trump associates during the 2016 campaign. They will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham plans to issue subpoenas for 53 individuals, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, all frequent Trump targets. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had largely avoided weighing in on this, but he recently embraced the investigations in a floor speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: No matter what some Washington Democrats may try to claim, you're not crazy or a conspiracy theorist if you see a pattern of institutional unfairness toward this president. You would have to be blind not to see one. DAVIS: Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley, who testified against Trump's impeachment in the House, said investigations can be political and still have merit. JONATHAN TURLEY: I certainly believe that the oversight interests are stronger when you're looking at things like the Russian investigation. The Burisma controversy presents a more challenging question. However, I tend to favor some inquiry. DAVIS: As vulnerable House Democrats experienced during impeachment, politically loaded investigations can spark backlash when voters have more urgent concerns, like the pandemic, the economy and social unrest. Democratic strategist Scott Mulhauser is a former Biden aide. He said Senate Republicans, who are fighting to hold their majority this November, could be making a political blunder. SCOTT MULHAUSER: It's an overreach here, an overplay of your hand with these hearings - taking your eye off the ball. These are mistakes that could cost careers. DAVIS: Senator Graham says he'd like to issue a report by October, just in time for the election. Susan Davis, NPR News, Washington.

No one was injured, but the shooting ratcheted up tension at an otherwise peaceful protest. Click 'play' to hear the audio version of this story. Americans have taken to the streets across the country to protest police brutality after a Minneapolis man was killed while in police custody. A now ex-officer was charged in the killing of George Floyd. The protests in Boise have remained peaceful, but the incident threatened to upset the calm. A man carrying a rifle fired a round into the ground near the State Capitol before being disarmed by a protester, according to witnesses. Police quickly took Michael Daniel Wallace, 18, into custody. Witnesses say the suspected shooter had been pacing up and down throughout the rally, yelling at protesters, armed with a rifle and a handgun and wearing military-style tactical gear. Indeed, videos posted to Facebook show a man in tactical gear with a rifle walking back and forth through the crowd. A video shared with BSPR of the moments leading up to the incident shows the shooter conferring with a group of counter-protesters carrying Confederate flags. He then walks away, past the camera and seconds later there is a gunshot. A protester quickly swoops in, takes away the rifle and pulls out the ammunition magazine. The protester who took the video asked not to be named for fear it could imperil her job. She said she suspected the shooter may have been trying to change a peaceful atmosphere. Before the shot, she said protesters and a group of supporters of President Donald Trump had made peace after initial tension. “That shot, it was more of an intimidation kind of a thing,” she said. “And my reaction was to scream, you (expletive) idiot.” Jonathan Gordon was one of the Trump supporters at the rally. He backed up the account of unity among participants and said he and his friends had even been chanting with the protesters to show their support. Then came the gunshot. “It had a very destabilizing effect,” Gordon said. “It split both groups up immediately.” Both of the witnesses said things calmed down after Wallace was arrested and remained peaceful. But they also know it could have sparked something ugly. “It almost seemed like it was coordinated to agitate the whole entire situation,” Gordon said. “Especially after everyone was getting along well.” And indeed, after initially saying the shooting appeared accidental, police now say that might not be the case. “It does not appear that that was intended to harm anyone although there is some discrepancy on whether it was intentional or not,” Boise Interim Police Chief Ron Winegar said at a Tuesday press conference. Boise Police spokeswoman Haley Williams said after officers spoke to witnesses, they forwarded their findings to prosecutors, who could amend the charge if they can prove intention.",0.0

The incident, during which officers used stun guns on the pair and pulled them from their vehicle, received national attention after bystanders recorded and posted video to social media. ""I agree with Mayor [Keisha Lance] Bottoms and I agree with our police chief, Erika Shields, when they both have conveyed in so many separate ways that the conduct in this incident — it is not indicative of the way that we treat people in the city of Atlanta,"" Fulton County, Ga., District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters Tuesday. Howard's office has filed charges — mostly assorted aggravated assault and battery counts — against a half-dozen officers involved in the arrest: Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Streeter and Gardner have been fired from the force since Saturday's confrontation, while three others have been placed on desk duty. Howard said the charges are backed up by extensive interviews with the young couple, Taniyah Pilgrim and Messiah Young, as well as video evidence from bystanders and the officers' body camera footage. The district attorney played one such video from a bodycam. During the video, officers on foot confront Pilgrim and Young, who had been passing them in a car. After the two black occupants appear to drive away briefly from the officers, Pilgrim and Young stop — at which point the officers swarm the vehicle. Stun guns are used on both occupants, who are ripped from the car over Pilgrim's screams to stop. Pilgrim was never charged; Young was charged with attempting to elude officers before the charge was dismissed at the request of the mayor, who apologized. ""We just need to see that all officers are held accountable, and that there really is change moving forward within the culture of policing,"" Young said at a news conference. Atlanta and other cities have seen widespread protests over the past week after another video — that of George Floyd's arrest in Minneapolis — catalyzed outrage over violence in policing. Floyd died after Derek Chauvin — who has since been fired from the Minneapolis police and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter — dug a knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Video of the incident involving Pilgrim and Young caused a stir of its own. ""We understand our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" the Atlanta mayor said Sunday, describing the video as ""disturbing on many levels."" ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.""  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In dozens of cities yesterday, large, mostly peaceful demonstrations devolved into chaos. In Nashville, Miami, Seattle and Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, New York and, frankly, too many other places to name, protesters expressed their rage at the death of George Floyd, police brutality and racism. There were violent confrontations with police, and police cracked down, also violently. There were also mass arrests and injuries among demonstrators, journalists and police. At least a dozen major cities declared curfews. Others called on the National Guard, which has been historically used in response to major civil unrest. There were scenes of National Guard marching through some residential neighborhoods, ordering people to stay inside. We go now to Los Angeles, where members of the National Guard were also deployed overnight and a curfew was put in place as a state of emergency was declared. NPR's Nathan Rott is in LA, and he joins us now. Nate, walk us through what happened yesterday. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: So there was a massive peaceful protest that started around noon yesterday. It was in the Fairfax district in west L.A., which is kind of a trendy neighborhood with high-end retail and a big outdoor mall. And people were protesting against police violence, as they are all over the country. They were memorializing George Floyd, the black man who died after being pinned to the ground by Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, by all accounts, it was peaceful, respectful until a little later in the afternoon, when we started seeing reports of police cars being set on fire and just a total breakdown in the situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This often happens at protests, right? When things shift as things go into the night. Do we know what happened? ROTT: Yeah. And that - honestly, that was a little surprising, Lulu. Usually, these, like, shifts do happen at night. And this started in broad daylight in mid-afternoon, which is, I think, very concerning to a lot of the city officials. So, you know, on social media, people were blaming the police for escalating tensions, for responding with tear gas and the sort of militarized riot gear that has become so commonplace around the country. City officials have so far blamed bad eggs in the crowd for setting things off, and that's something we've been hearing in a lot of places - that it's a small group of people who are agitating these situations. Of course, that's now been politicized, even with the U.S. attorney general blaming anarchists and leftists without, you know, providing any proof of that. But it's really hard to say what makes this situations shift. Tensions are obviously very high, so it doesn't take much to spark something. GARCIA-NAVARRO: No, it doesn't. We saw videos of looting and fires in many cities around the country last night. That was also the case in LA, right? ROTT: Yeah. A number of retail stores in that Fairfax area were broken into. Goods were stolen. Some were set on fire. I know firefighters were dealing with those fires throughout the night. That prompted LA's mayor, Eric Garcetti, to announce a citywide curfew, which caught a lot of people off guard because he announced it an hour before it went into effect. But here he is explaining why they did it and alluding to violent protests in 1992 following Rodney King. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: We've seen this before in Los Angeles. When the violence escalates, no one wins. And so everybody has to be responsible for owning this moment. Whether you wear a badge or whether you hold a sign, I'm asking all of Los Angeles to take a deep breath and to step back for a moment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does it seem like the curfew worked briefly? ROTT: Yeah, the crowds started to thin out even before the curfew started. I know in other parts of the state - Sacramento, San Diego - there were large confrontations between crowds and police. I think, you know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Nate Rott in LA. Thank you so much. ROTT: Yeah. Thank you, Lulu.

House Democrats are sorting through dozens of proposals to address policing issues, including excessive use of force and racial profiling. ""It is time, it is time for us to address the concerns that were being expressed by the protesters,"" Pelosi said at a press event at the Capitol Tuesday. ""This is not a single incident. We know this is a pattern of behavior. and we also know the history that brings us to this sad place."" Democrats hope to calm the increasingly incendiary atmosphere in the country over Floyd's death by finding ways to address the underlying systemic problems enraging protesters in the streets. There is some degree of bipartisan support for reviewing the tactics that led to Floyd's death. Many Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have acknowledged what McConnell called ""egregious wrongs."" McConnell said Tuesday there could be a role for Congress to play here. ""It's certainly something that we need to take a look at,"" McConnell told reporters. ""We'll be talking to our colleagues about what, if anything, is appropriate for us to do in the wake of what's going on."" But the discussion has often become entwined with public outcry over President Trump's handling of the unrest and his threat to use military force to quell protests. Pelosi said Floyd's killing ""happened in broad daylight, it happened for all the world to see. A knee to the neck, not only by the perpetrator of that murder but by three officers observing it."" Congress has often struggled to address policing issues. Many decisions about policing tactics, training and strategies are determined at the state and local level. Pelosi is asking members of the Congressional Black Caucus to sort through the ideas and find legislation that can pass the House where Democrats have enough votes for approval without GOP support. Among the options is a 2015 bill introduced by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that would outlaw the use of chokeholds in policing. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has endorsed that idea. Democrats are hoping to reach an agreement quickly. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters he could call lawmakers back to Washington to vote before their scheduled return on June 30. Hoyer said that he has been in contact with the Congressional Black Caucus over the last four days and that it is considering more than 50 pieces of legislation, including a proposal to end qualified immunity for police officers, or their legal protection shield for certain actions. Democrats also plan to try to force the Senate to go on record condemning Trump for ""ordering federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against Americans who were peaceably protesting"" Monday outside the White House. The resolution, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would also affirm the rights of free assembly and protest while condemning looting. The measure is unlikely to pass as it requires unanimous consent to be approved. Republicans, including McConnell, have largely focused on calling for protests to remain peaceful without directly discussing the conflict at the White House. ""It is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace in our streets and peace in our communities,"" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""We need to unite against these violent rioters who seek only to aggrandize themselves and further damage a nation that needs healing."" Most Senate Republicans declined Tuesday to discuss the tear gas incident at the White House when reporters on Capitol Hill asked them about it. Some avoided the question; others said they didn't see the incident. Those who did speak to reporters mostly focused on condemning violent protests. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has announced a June 16 hearing on police use of force. ""We intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd's death, with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation,"" Graham said in a statement Friday. ",0.0

White House Officials say it's Antifa. The mayor of Washington DC and other mayors say the riots were caused by a majority of outside agitators. The reason people took to the streets was to protest the death of George Floyd while being arrested in Minnesota. However, common sense tells us that looting, destroying police property and other incidents, do not further the memory of Mr. Floyd. Anarchists and criminals have used this as an opportunity to deconstruct America. Their first target is our great men and women of law enforcement. Without law enforcement, anarchy rules. Go read the Federalist Papers. Our Founding Fathers feared mob rule. We are seeing mob rule across the country. Those officers who have and will be charged are innocent till proven guilty. That is our American system of justice. Without due process, our country is lost. When the Whiskey Rebellion took place, our fledgling federal government understood that we needed a stronger system of governance. The Articles of Confederation were out and the Constitution was in.

Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Chauvin, who was later fired, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

""Violence has no place and violence must be addressed,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told NPR's All Things Considered. ""But there is no reason for the U.S. military to be called out for this."" Pelosi was referring to a threat Trump made Monday evening in the Rose Garden at the White House. ""If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents,"" Trump declared in a brief statement, ""then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" As the president spoke, federal officers in riot gear near the White House launched tear gas and pepper spray at peaceful protesters. Shortly thereafter, Trump strode through a park cleared of the demonstrators to pose with a Bible in front of St. John's Church, leading a group of officials that included Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Walking like lapdogs behind a five-time draft dodging coward who is more interested in looking like a leader than actually being one,"" Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who lost both legs in combat as a military helicopter pilot in Iraq, said of Esper and Milley, ""sends a horrifying message to our troops — including our black and brown troops — that our military's leaders will not protect them from unlawful orders."" In a statement on Twitter, Duckworth added, ""We cannot allow any Commander in Chief to put our Armed Forces' reputation as the last institution Americans can trust and respect at risk by using them unlawfully and putting them in a position of exacerbating the divisions driving our union apart. ... Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not Presidential, it's tin-pot dictatorial."" But Trump does appear to have the power unilaterally to dispatch active-duty soldiers to trouble spots in the United States. The 1807 Insurrection Act authorizes a U.S. president to deploy military forces for domestic emergencies. The law was updated in 2006 to include natural disasters and terrorist attacks as grounds for sending federal troops to restore order. While condemning looting and vandalism that rocked Providence, R.I., on Monday evening, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, called Trump's threats to use military force against American citizens ""irresponsible and destablizing."" ""The job of bringing calm will take law enforcement and the community working together,"" Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. ""It will not come from recklessly invoking the Insurrection Act."" The Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee told reporters Tuesday he plans to convene an in-person congressional hearing next week to press the Pentagon's top two officials on Trump's possible invocation of the Insurrection Act. ""We need to hear from Chairman Milley and Secretary Esper as to exactly how they intend to use the U.S. military trying to deal with this domestic crisis,"" U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said on a video conference call. ""If the president is basically threatening to use the U.S. military to go in and enforce the law in U.S. cities, that runs the risk of an extreme escalation in violence and of a hugely disruptive practice."" Asked about Milley wearing camouflage fatigues in public Monday night, Smith said the nation's highest military officer may have misread the message being sent. ""The optics of him being in uniform out there might not have been so bad if we didn't have the president out there talking about going to war with the country and using the military and using overwhelming force,"" Smith said of Milley. In a conference call Monday, Trump told the nation's governors that Milley was ""a fighter, a war hero, a lot of victories and no losses and he hates to see the way it's being handled in the various states, and I just put him in charge."" Milley, whom Trump said was on the call, said nothing. But a senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that the Insurrection Act had not been invoked by Trump and insisted that Milley's role and authorities have not changed.

BOISE, Idaho — Boise's mayor and chief of police both called for a peaceful turnout from those planning to attend a vigil for George Floyd on the Idaho Capitol steps Tuesday night. The remarks by Mayor Lauren McLean and Acting Chief Ron Winegar echo sentiments expressed by the event's organizers themselves, who have stressed that the candlelight vigil is neither a protest nor rally. The vigil, planned for 8:30 p.m., is one of several gatherings that has taken place in Boise in response to the May 25 death of Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died after a police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd struggled to breathe and called out for help. The Minneapolis Police officer has since been charged with murder. In a Tuesday afternoon press conference, McLean said she understood residents' reactions of anger and sorrow. ""I want to acknowledge that these are really hard times for our community and our country. We are all hurting, especially members of our black community,"" she said. ""The unjust and inhumane death of George Floyd brings pain and suffering not just to his family, but to countless members of our own city and nation whose lives and lived experience includes the byproduct and impact of centuries of racism and oppression."" Tonight, members of the Boise community will stand together to honor the legacy of those who have lost their lives because of racism in our country. Alongside @BoisePD and the vigil's community organizers, we are asking for peaceful and respectful voices. https://t.co/VXcR5prKcI — City of Boise (@CityOfBoise) June 2, 2020 The mayor noted that even Floyd's family has asked for demonstrations to remain peaceful after days of violence and unrest in cities around the country. Those who plan to attend Tuesday's vigil should abide by those wishes and ""come in peace,"" McLean said. ""We are asking you, residents of Boise, to be peaceful, to honor the lives and legacy of those whose lives are lost, and to be respectful not only today but in the days to come as we have tough conversations as a community and nation,"" she said. Tensions have flared at some of the Boise protests, but for the most part they have not turned violent or destructive, Winegar said. The police chief did make note of an incident at Monday night's protest in front of the Statehouse, during which a gunshot was fired into the ground. An 18-year-old Garden City man was arrested and charged in connection with that shooting. Police have said the shot appears to have been an accidental discharge. ""We are very, very thankful that no one was injured and that there was not any physical violence last night. We are very thankful for that and we hope for that to be the case tonight as well,"" Winegar said. ""We look forward to having everyone express themselves freely and not having it boil over into those tensions that lead to violence."" When asked whether he supported people showing up to protest or counterprotest with firearms, Winegar responded that carrying a gun was not illegal. ""We are supportive of all rights in our community, and we are there to facilitate everyone's point of view being safely expressed. Having said that, I don't know if it's ever a great idea to have lots of guns and people coming,"" he said. ""I would just say that we feel comfortable in our ability to provide a safe atmosphere, and if folks are coming with weapons to try and ensure safety - we feel like we have a handle on it."" Both Boise Police officers and Idaho State Police troopers were on hand during the earlier protests, and will monitor the vigil Tuesday night as well. ""We will absolutely have a presence tonight, and we will do everything in our power to make sure that the event comes off as safely as we can possibly ensure,"" Winegar said. Vigil organizers have also asked attendees to wear a facemask and practice physical distancing from one another to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Boise city council member Lisa Sanchez added that if people do not want to attend the vigil itself, they can still show support by educating themselves on issues of race and working in other ways to improve their community.",0.0

BOISE, Idaho — Terrifying moments on the steps of the state capitol on Monday, after Boise Police say, 18-year-old Michael Wallace accidentally fired a round from his assault rifle as crowds were protesting. Among those in the crowd was Anthony Walsh. “In my gut, I just had a feeling that something was not going to go well,” Walsh recalled. “When the gun went off all of us kind of crouched down on the ground my heart started racing and my adrenaline started going immediately.” Walsh told KTVB that he was originally at Monday’s protests to document what was happening but then started doing surveillance when he noticed another group of people armed with rifles, standing across the street from the other protesters. “When that gun went off, I was just like infuriated that someone would even discharge a gun, not only among a group of people, but there were a bunch of kids around there at the same time,” Walsh said. Despite the incident, Walsh says he's proud that what started out as a peaceful protest ended peacefully. “Our forefathers gave us the right to peacefully protest and we need to keep things, protests peaceful across our nation, destroying our communities is not the way to go about this, there are much more better ways to get our message across,” Walsh said. Although some people who attended Monday’s protest told KTVB there were two separate groups protesting, a viewer emailed KTVB saying he was one of the protesters who were armed and they were not part of a separate group, but “simply there to protect their homes and livelihoods from any individuals that threaten it."" Gov. Brad Little’s office emailed KTVB the following statement: “Thankfully, protests in Idaho have been mostly peaceful. local law enforcement and Idaho state police are monitoring protests across the state and doing a good job engaging at the appropriate level.”",0.0

Protests have taken place around the country in the aftermath of George Floyd's death. Police forces have used tear gas to disperse protesters in many of these protests. Some social media users have wondered if tear gas could spread or exacerbate COVID-19. THE QUESTION Can tear gas spread COVID-19? THE ANSWER: Yes. Exposure to tear gas leads to coughing and sneezing -- both spread respiratory droplets. Exposure also leads to touching the face. All of these can increase the chance of infection. WHAT WE FOUND The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website explains the effects of riot control agents, also known as tear gas, as “chemical compounds that make people temporarily unable to function by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs and skin.” Both the CDC and Healthline say the severity of symptoms can depend on the exposure to it being on an open or enclosed space, the amount of tear gas, the proximity to it or whether you have a preexisting health condition. The VERIFY team contacted Dr. Payal Kohli, KUSA’s medical correspondent, and she said that tear gas “can actually help facilitate the spread because it can lead to coughing, sneezing and shouting which spreads droplets and tearing (some reports say that tears can spread the virus) and touching of the face. So spraying this into crowds during a pandemic may not be the best idea.” When it comes to the possibility of tear gas affecting someone’s response to COVID-19, the doctor clarified that there’s not enough evidence to support that but it is an efficient way to help spread the virus as “it leads to more respiratory droplets being emitted,” Kohli said. The doctor made clear that public events like demonstrations and protests are ""super spreaders,"" and recommends people to wear masks, a form of eye protection, long sleeves, to not wear makeup or contacts, maintain social distancing and to carry hand sanitizer.",0.0

Oklahoma State linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga says he tested positive for COVID-19 after he attended a protest in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Ogbongbemiga made the announcement in a Twitter post.

Please, if you are going to protest, take care of yourself and stay safe. — Amen Ogbongbemiga (@closedprayer) June 3, 2020 Protests in top virus hot spots ignite fears of contagion As demonstrators flooded streets across America to decry the killing of George Floyd, public health experts watched in alarm — the close proximity of protesters and their failures in many cases to wear masks, along with the police using tear gas, could fuel new transmissions of the coronavirus. Many of the protests broke out in places where the virus is still circulating widely in the population. In fact, an Associated Press review found that demonstrations have taken place in every one of the 25 U.S. communities with the highest concentrations of new cases. Some have seen major protests over multiple days, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The protests have come just as communities across the nation loosen restrictions on businesses and public life that have helped slow the spread of the virus, deepening concern that the two factors taken together could create a national resurgence in cases. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser warned Sunday after days of protests rocked the nation’s capital. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo bemoaned the crowds, saying that hundreds could potentially have been infected, undoing months of social distancing. A fresh outbreak in the places where protesters gathered could lead to reinstituting shutdowns. The AP’s review focused on large metro counties — the central counties within metro areas with more than 1 million people — that showed the highest rates of new cases per capita over the past 14 days. While case numbers and deaths have been trending down in several of the cities where the largest protests have occurred, the number of people in those places infected with the virus — and with the ability to spread it — remains high. And in some of the communities, such as Minneapolis, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has been rising. Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes, even as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Minneapolis has been ground zero for the sprawling protests, which have crossed the Mississippi River into neighboring St. Paul. The unrest has coincided with “the very worst days of the pandemic so far” in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “Our ICU bed care is at its all-time high and is really on the edge,” he said. Ramsey and Hennepin counties, home to the Twin Cities, ranked seventh and eighth for the highest per capita new cases in the AP analysis. Each has seen more than 250 cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks, together reporting nearly 2,000 new cases in the last week alone. Experts point out that other factors associated with protests could accelerate the spread of the virus. For instance, tear gas can cause people to cough and sneeze, as can the smoke from fires set by people bent on destruction. And both also prompt protesters to remove their masks. Crowding protesters who have been arrested into jail cells can also increase the risk of contagion. An AP tally found that, thus far, more than 5,600 people have been taken into custody. Protesters and police shouting at one another nose-to-nose also is raising alarms. Osterholm and other public health experts note, however, that the protests aren’t necessarily as alarming as other events that could fuel new cases because they take place outside and many people are wearing masks. In some cases, hand sanitizer also is being informally distributed. And Dr. David Eisenman, director of the Center for Public Health and Disasters at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said he feared partisan forces might accuse cities of bringing fresh cases on themselves. “I’m actually more worried about how, if those spikes occur, how that information will be weaponized against the notion of protests,” he said. Eisenman called protesting an “essential activity,” possible to practice with reduced risk. He said his grown children protested in Los Angeles and are taking safety precautions now, including isolating themselves at home. They plan to get tested for COVID-19 in about a week. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the hospitalizations for coronavirus in the Washington metro area have been on the decline but that she knows that could change. “There are a lot of unknowns about what happens next,” she said. Wen was the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore during the 2015 uprising after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and said many health clinics were closed and pharmacies burned down, making it difficult for members of disadvantaged communities to access health care. It’s a concern for her now, too. “You will have compounded health issues that go beyond COVID-19,” she said. Public health experts said it will take two to three weeks to know whether the protests cause a surge in coronavirus cases. And even then, they can’t definitively tie it to the demonstrations. The unrest is happening in tandem with the reopening of gyms, hair salons, restaurants, parks and beaches. It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. In Los Angeles, barbershops and in-person dining were allowed to resume last weekend, just as protests descended into destruction and more than 1,000 people were arrested. Nearly 10,000 new cases have been reported in Los Angeles County in the past week. Hundreds of people also were arrested in Chicago, where Cook County has had among the highest per capita rates of new cases of any large county in the nation, with 283 new cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks. “The absolute number of cases is still high. We feel good about the fact that we’ve established a decreasing incidence, but we have a ways to go,” said Dr. Ronald Hershow the director of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Hershow and others noted that the racial disparities laid bare by coronavirus — with communities of color bearing a disproportionate burden of infections and deaths — overlap with the issues being protested on streets across America and around the globe. “Racism kills,” Hershow said. “Sometimes that’s direct, as in the case of George Floyd. And sometimes it’s through a virus like COVID-19.” ___",0.0

He hopped on Facebook and saw protests and riots around the country. He saw his parents in D.C. participate in Black Lives Matter protests, and he knew he needed to join the cause. On May 31 he rode his bike from a closed Broulim’s to Walmart in search of chalk, but only found tape. Willis then approached the corner of 1st West and 1st South, across the street from the Cedars apartments and Papa John’s, then began taping a rhetorical question to the sidewalk with his brother’s help. As he taped, people shouted support from the apartments, some watched from a balcony with no comment. Others called out, “You guys are white.” His tape ran out, and some girls showed up, interested in his message. They traveled to Walmart to purchase more tape and finished Willis’ statement. “I wanted to bring awareness to some of the things that are happening,” Willis said. “A lot of people are misinformed, and a lot of people actually have no idea this stuff is happening.” Willis, his brother, and new friends headed to Taco Bell, and he worried that the tape would eventually be removed. When they returned to the corner 10 minutes later, they found the balled-up remains sitting in the center. He returned home, planning how he would prepare for the next day. Cailin Russell, a senior studying art, saw a guy pulling something off of the street corner. She hadn’t seen Willis’ tape art, but later saw posts about it. She didn’t know Willis, but a friend suggested they recreate his message. Russell and her friend Jaron Rose, a senior studying theatre, bought six boxes of chalk and asked others to help mark the sidewalk. Marcella Fa’amuli, a sophomore studying generals, came to help. “I am black, I am gay, so just being a minority, you have to defend the small guys,” Rose said. “We’re taught to love one another, so here we are.” Their chalk mural included scripture references, putting Willis’ initial message in the center. Willis received a text message saying someone had chalked his statement on the same corner at Porter Park. “I was so excited I came running out,” Willis said. “It was amazing, this awesome mural.” Grey Woodhouse, the one behind Instagram’s restorebyui account sharing Black Lives Matter support happening in Rexburg, worried someone would ruin the chalked mural. She and Alexa Arndt, a BYU-Idaho alumna, walked to the corner and asked several people standing nearby if they supported the Black Lives Matter messages. They did not. Arndt had the idea to watch the corner from a balcony at the Cedars apartments. As they staked out, a student that had been circling around on a dirt bike earlier that day had a bucket with him. “I bet he’s going to throw a bucket of water on it,” Woodhouse said. As soon as he reached for the bucket, Woodhouse ran down to the mural while Arndt filmed it. Water splashed on the mural before Woodhouse could make it. A soaked dead mouse rested in the center. Woodhouse saw where the unidentified student went and confronted him. She said he insisted the mural was a social media stunt. “I’m white, you’re white, and we can’t explain how black people feel,” Woodhouse said. She posted a live video on Instagram calling out the student who later returned to the corner where they again chalked their support and apologized, according to Woodhouse. “Last night wasn’t just a bucket of water,” Arndt said. “It was a representation of the ideologies that are preserved year after year, that never change.” They formed as a group and decided to take their chalk to the sidewalk again on Monday night. “We’re back today to rebel against the people that are causing pain, and aren’t letting us build to a solution,” Willis said. “This is a peaceful protest, and a lot of people can’t even handle this.” Monday night’s chalk was mostly scrubbed away by Tuesday morning. Allegedly a BYU-I employee cleaned the sidewalk.",0.0

Families waved signs to cars passing by. “I know people can’t understand what I’ve been through without being black but it just comes down to trying, all we need is people trying,” said Jared Shakespeare, a junior studying biology. Local businesses also donated food in support of the protestors including Righteous Slice and Crumbl. “Every-time someone opens the door we could hear everyone screaming and it motivates us on all the movements going around,” said Paige Huntsman a senior at Madison High School and employee for Crumbl. Protestors stood on a corner of Porter Park for two hours and were greeted by cars honking and people waving, as well as other reactions such as getting flipped off and trucks blowing smoke clouds in their faces. A man got out of his car to talk about the protest and why it wasn’t “All Lives Matter.” He was greeted by four protestors who discussed the reason for the protest. Later, the drove away honking his horn and giving a thumbs up. “I think people need to feel comfortable asking questions and having those open conversations so this doesn’t happen anymore,” said Nzinga Lawson, a senior majoring in social work. The protestors then walked around the park chanting things like, “No justice, no peace” and “Black Lives Matter.” Afterward, they laid face down with their hands behind their backs to honor the position that Floyd George died in. Steven Stewart, a resident protesting with his daughter said, “These are real issues and they affect real people, like the sign says here ‘All lives can’t matter until black lives matter.” The protestors then walked to the intersection between North Point and the Cedars housing to draw in chalk on the sidewalk.

BOISE, Idaho — Thousands gathered at the Idaho State Capitol Building Tuesday evening as part of a vigil in memory of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis last week while in police custody. The Boise vigil itself was peaceful, with thousands packed in front of the Capitol, many wearing black shirts and masks. (Scroll down to see a slideshow of the vigil crowd.) Most vigil attendees left shortly after it ended, but the downtown atmosphere of the night changed as a few people remained to protest and march, chanting loudly. (Scroll down to see tweets from protests after the vigil.) At one point, there was a tense exchange between the remaining Black Lives Matter supporters and a group of people waving Blue Lives Matter flags. Boise Police and Idaho State Police separated the two groups. No violence broke out between the groups but Boise police did suit up in their riot gear and kept them apart. The vigil comes off the heels of Floyd's death but also honored all black lives lost due to police brutality or at the hands of fellow citizens. KTVB had three reporters at the vigil - Joe Parris, Gretchen Parsons, and Misty Inglet. All three said the vigil has been peaceful. Parris stayed at the vigil well into the night and followed the remaining attendees of the vigil march up and down downtown Boise until they returned to the statehouse, where they eventually encountered counter-protesters. A few tense moments, but the groups are separated again. pic.twitter.com/LqaluGNgjR — Joe Parris (@KTVBJoe) June 3, 2020 Vigil organizers told Joe Parris that they believe anywhere between 3,000 to 5,000 people attended the vigil. Misty Inglet spoke with several Boise police officers after the vigil and all said things were peaceful from their perspective and that they had no problems. The vigil follows Monday's protest, which was also peaceful. However, an 18-year-old man was arrested after he accidentally fired a gun at the protest. Michael Wallace of Garden City was booked into the Ada County Jail on a misdemeanor charge of discharge of a firearm in city limits and since been released on bail. See more tweets from the protests after the vigil here (story continues below): Mayor Lauren McLean and Acting Chief Ron Winegar held a press conference on Tuesday afternoon where they urged for a calm and peaceful vigil. ""I want to acknowledge that these are really hard times for our community and our country. We are all hurting, especially members of our black community,"" Mayor McLean said. ""The unjust and inhumane death of George Floyd brings pain and suffering not just to his family, but to countless members of our own city and nation whose lives and lived experience includes the byproduct and impact of centuries of racism and oppression.""

But when the Canadian prime minister was asked what he thought of President Trump's actions to quash a wave of protests across the U.S., Trudeau paused before responding – for 21 seconds as the cameras recorded his awkward silence. During a Tuesday news conference in front of his Ottawa residence, the prime minister fielded this question from a reporter: ""You've been reluctant to comment about the words and actions of the U.S. president. But we do have now Donald Trump calling for military action against protesters. We saw protesters tear-gassed yesterday to make way for a presidential photo-op. I'd like to ask you what you think about that. And, if you don't want to comment, what message do you think you're sending?"" Before answering, the prime minister, sporting a beard and shaggy hair since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, glanced down at his lectern, opened his mouth as if to speak — then paused, shifted his weight and uttered a barely audible ""um"" as birds chirped in the background. ""We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,"" he finally said. ""It is a time to pull people together, but it is a time to listen. ""It is a time to learn what injustices continue despite progress over years and decades. But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges,"" he said. ""That black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day,"" Trudeau continued. ""There is systemic discrimination in Canada, which means our systems treat Canadians of color, Canadians who are racialized, as differently than they do others."" Trudeau typically displays reticence on Trump's actions, keeping in mind the centrality of the U.S.-Canada relationship and its huge cross-border economic interdependence. Canada in recent days has seen relatively small, peaceful protests in solidarity with U.S. demonstrations that first erupted last week in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. By contrast, the protests in U.S. cities have typically been much larger and have frequently devolved into clashes between police and activists. The Canadian protests supporting Black Lives Matter have sprung up in Montreal, Halifax, Toronto and Regina, the provincial capital of Saskatchewan. At the protest in Regina on Tuesday, when a few hundred people gathered, one of the organizers, Faith Olanipekun, told the CBC that, ""A lot of people here think that Canada isn't racist.""

No one was injured, but the shooting ratcheted up tension at an otherwise peaceful protest. Click 'play' to hear the audio version of this story. Americans have taken to the streets across the country to protest police brutality after a Minneapolis man was killed while in police custody. A now ex-officer was charged in the killing of George Floyd. The protests in Boise have remained peaceful, but the incident threatened to upset the calm. A man carrying a rifle fired a round into the ground near the State Capitol before being disarmed by a protester, according to witnesses. Police quickly took Michael Daniel Wallace, 18, into custody. Witnesses say the suspected shooter had been pacing up and down throughout the rally, yelling at protesters, armed with a rifle and a handgun and wearing military-style tactical gear. Indeed, videos posted to Facebook show a man in tactical gear with a rifle walking back and forth through the crowd. A video shared with BSPR of the moments leading up to the incident shows the shooter conferring with a group of counter-protesters carrying Confederate flags. He then walks away, past the camera and seconds later there is a gunshot. A protester quickly swoops in, takes away the rifle and pulls out the ammunition magazine. The protester who took the video asked not to be named for fear it could imperil her job. She said she suspected the shooter may have been trying to change a peaceful atmosphere. Before the shot, she said protesters and a group of supporters of President Donald Trump had made peace after initial tension. “That shot, it was more of an intimidation kind of a thing,” she said. “And my reaction was to scream, you (expletive) idiot.” Jonathan Gordon was one of the Trump supporters at the rally. He backed up the account of unity among participants and said he and his friends had even been chanting with the protesters to show their support. Then came the gunshot. “It had a very destabilizing effect,” Gordon said. “It split both groups up immediately.” Both of the witnesses said things calmed down after Wallace was arrested and remained peaceful. But they also know it could have sparked something ugly. “It almost seemed like it was coordinated to agitate the whole entire situation,” Gordon said. “Especially after everyone was getting along well.” And indeed, after initially saying the shooting appeared accidental, police now say that might not be the case. “It does not appear that that was intended to harm anyone although there is some discrepancy on whether it was intentional or not,” Boise Interim Police Chief Ron Winegar said at a Tuesday press conference. Boise Police spokeswoman Haley Williams said after officers spoke to witnesses, they forwarded their findings to prosecutors, who could amend the charge if they can prove intention.",0.0

Not far away, a dozen or so men and women in leather jackets and combat fatigues stood by, rifles strapped to their backs. Despite what might seem like two extremes in opposition to each other, both protesters and armed spectators said they were on the same side. “I think the armed guys are here to ensure there’s no looting tonight, mostly,” demonstrator Frances Smith said. “They’re guardians for Coeur d’Alene, ultimately. They’ve stood up for us a few times tonight.” The demonstrators held signs with messages in memory of George Floyd and in support of Tyler Rambo, a young black man who lost both legs after being shot 10 times by Coeur d’Alene police last year. Chants rang out across the narrow street as families ate on restaurant patios and made their way through the crowd. Smith said she had been one of the first to arrive at Tuesday’s protest, around 2 p.m. She said she had seen more support than disagreement, with passers-by and drivers honking, waving and flashing peace signs. The protest had spread mostly through word of mouth in a “very grassroots way,” Smith said, with no one group organizing the event. Laura Tenneson, chair of the Kootenai County Democratic Central Committee, said the committee had not been encouraging people to protest due to the ongoing pandemic and the potential for escalation. Around 7:30 p.m., one man passing through the crowd of protesters got into an altercation with a demonstrator, the cause of which was not immediately clear. As several of the armed men standing by stepped in to separate the two, protesters chanted, “We love you,” as the man left the crowd. Demonstrator Joseph Pleasant said the unofficial guardians made him feel a little safer. The protest had been largely uneventful, Pleasant said, with only a few detractors yelling profanities or expressing opposition to the demonstration’s message. “There have been a couple guys trying to silence us, but the Trump supporters down there are helping keep it under control,” Pleasant said. “We won’t be silenced, and I guess I’m glad people with guns are here to make sure that happens.” Kathy Plonka - The Spokesman-Review Mike Marquardt stood near the protesters, a rifle slung across his chest. He and others had heard rumors of anti-fascist militants causing riots and looting in other cities, including Spokane. “I think there are two types of people,” Marquardt said. “The good people who are here to get a message across, and we are here to support and protect them. Then there are those who come to take advantage of the situation and cause trouble. We are here to protect against those.” Dan Carson attended Tuesday’s event as well as an earlier protest at the Coeur d’Alene Winco. He “was 100 percent in support” of the demonstration’s message, but said he wasn’t the protesting kind. Carson said the guns he carried were simply a projection of power to discourage any would-be opportunists. He said those standing by with firearms didn’t want to fire them. “We’re making sure they’re heard in a peaceful way, plain and simple,” Carson said. “But if things go bad, we do whatever we have to. We will not let our city burn.”",0.0

While a majority of protesters have been wearing masks, those large crowds make it difficult to social distance. And that, according to some experts, could possibly lead to a second wave of the virus. Dr. Jason West, owner of The West Clinic in Idaho, spoke to our Brandon Bartlett about that concern. Transcription Brandon Bartlett: Dr. West. Thanks for joining us tonight. We have gone from staying inside for a month to now seen thousands of people taking to the streets of several cities across the country to protest the death of George Floyd. Is there a concern that those large gatherings could set off a second wave of the Coronavirus? Dr. Jason West: Well, in a weird way, I mean, I hate the violence and I hate the destruction of personal property the looting but in a weird way, it’s kind of a test for the Coronavirus because it should have some increased areas of infection. If there’s a second wave coming and if the protesters aren’t having these infection rate increases, then maybe it’s time we can open up churches and theaters and football events. BB: Yeah, if the virus does begin to spread, how long would it be before we know it? JW: Well, from what I understand from the literature, it’s gonna be two or three weeks. And you know, we’re looking for a dry cough, a fever, an increased, you know, feeling of unwellness. And then hopefully there’s a process where the protesters could get tested if that’s what’s happening, but it’s gonna be a couple weeks. BB: Well, as you know, these protests come while many cities are reopening, but there is no social distancing during most of these protests, some are wearing face masks, but do you think that those actually help in a situation like that? JW: I personally have some concerns that they really aren’t that beneficial. And usually what the literature is saying is that they N-95 masks you have the right pore size, the homemade masks or the modified masks, I think the virus is a lot smaller than the pore size and I’m just not convinced that it’s really going to be that helpful. BB: Okay, well, let’s talk about tear gas. Police have used that on some of the protesters; that makes your eyes water and you usually end up touching your eyes. It also makes you cough. Isn’t that how the virus is spread? JW: Well it could be and we have to remember is it’s the body trying to get rid of things. So the mucous membranes turn on, you get all the tears coming out, you’re coughing to try and get rid of things. And I’m not so certain that in a weird way, it’s not going to basically push things out. I’m not convinced that it’s really going to make it more susceptible for the infection. BB: In your opinion, do you think that protesters should be tested for COVID-19? JW: Well, I just it the whole protesting thing is so I guess emotionally and spiritually confusing to me. Because, yes, I think it was tragic what another human being did to a human being, the protesting, the destruction of property and the rioting and stuff, I don’t see how that really helps. I certainly understand why you would want social reform from this tragedy, from these horrible circumstances. And so for them to get special treatment for testing or anything like that. I don’t see the difference for what they would get tested versus someone else. I just think that there’s more productive ways to create change. BB: Most of the larger protests that we’ve been seeing are taking place in larger cities. There are some reports that some people from smaller towns are traveling to those larger cities to join in those protests. Is there a fear that those people can be exposed during the protests and then take the Coronavirus back with them to their home city? JW: Of course there is I mean, if you think about what we were trying to do with flattening the curve, we wanted to minimize the impact or the wave that was going to go into the healthcare system. And if there is protesters that are paying attention, I mean, if you can help your immune system to be healthy, which is water and vitamin C, and vitamin A and vitamin D, zinc and some of these other things, I think would be beneficial. If you want to minimize your impact, at least do some of the things to keep your immune system healthy. BB: And a majority of the people protesting are African American, and it’s known that the virus affects black Americans more than white Americans. Why is that? And is that a concern? JW: Well, I think what’s happening is is that is, it’s an example of genetics. You get bad DNA from your mom or your dad and some people, it’s gonna cause autoimmune problems. And in certain populations, it just seems that they’re a little bit more susceptible. And again, what we want to do is to try and help their immune systems be as healthy as possible prior to any exposure, and prior to spreading it to anybody else. BB: All right, a lot of great advice tonight, Dr. West. Thanks for joining us tonight. JW: Thank you so much, Brandon, for having me. Stay safe and stay healthy.",0.0

Rosenstein told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he relied on lower-level investigators and attorneys to do the right thing in preparing applications for the secret court that authorizes surveillance on Americans. Now, he said, he recognizes via the subsequent investigations that those officials did not do the right thing — and accordingly, Rosenstein said he wouldn't have signed the application. The former deputy attorney general defended the overall need for an investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election and said he stood by its findings and much of its work. But he also acknowledged that it has since become clear he and other Justice Department leaders were acting upon incomplete information. In the case of former Trump aide Carter Page, Rosenstein said he remembered an application for renewal, one that that had been submitted before, and one that he then believed made a cogent case to continue the surveillance. ""My recollection of it was that it was actually fairly persuasive,"" he said. GOP vows more investigation of Russia investigation Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went ahead with a session Wednesday scheduled before the flare in protests and violence that followed the death of a Minneapolis man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in an incident that reignited long-simmering anger at police in cities across the country. The political context has evolved; Republicans want to tie former Vice President Joe Biden into what they call the abuses of power from the end of the Obama era. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said what he called the ""Obama-Biden administration"" had done ""went right up to the very top"" and was worse than the abuses of President Richard Nixon. Cruz also called Rosenstein ""grossly negligent."" He and Republicans sought answers about what Rosenstein and other Justice Department leaders knew at the time they were making fateful decisions about the FBI's investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which sought to hinder Hillary Clinton and help elect then-candidate Donald Trump. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., rejected Cruz's comparison between Obama and Nixon and said it would ""never stand the test of time."" She also said Graham was wasting everyone's time now. ""I have made it very clear that I think that it is absurd we are having this hearing."" Strange days Rosenstein found himself in the center of a political vortex in the spring of 2017, not long after he'd been nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. His boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was a Trump loyalist and had recused himself from the Russian matter. The president had fired FBI Director James Comey. In the midst of that febrile atmosphere, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as a special counsel and continue the Russia investigation. ""I was concerned the public would not have confidence in the investigation and that the acting FBI director [at the time] was not the right person to lead it,"" Rosenstein told senators on Wednesday. ""I decided appointment of special counsel was the best way to complete the investigation and promote public confidence in the conclusions."" Re-look after re-look has verified Mueller's findings about the Russian interference, but the work of the FBI and Justice Department wasn't found to be problem-free. Issues with the FBI investigators involved and their dealings within officialdom, especially with the secret court that oversees government surveillance, have embarrassed the top levels of federal law enforcement. Longtime target Many Republicans have faulted Rosenstein since his earliest days over his appointment of Mueller. Now, Graham brought Rosenstein back into center stage at a time when Trump and other allies want to link Biden with intelligence collection that involved members of the Trump camp. Graham said he also intends to conduct more interviews and hearings about the investigation, including with planned subpoenas. One future witness could include the former deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, Graham said. ""We're going to get to the bottom of it ... this stinks,"" Graham said. ""This is a sad episode on the history of the FBI."" Biden's camp has rejected the idea there were any abuses and pointed out that there was no way for administration officials to single out Americans in intelligence reporting because their names were hidden, or masked. They were only identified after requests for more information about who was talking with existing targets, Biden's campaign said. That practice is legal and takes place thousands of times per year. Trump and allies have made it the basis of political attacks against Biden and others from that era, as Cruz repeated at Wednesday's hearing. Biden, in turn, has blasted Trump and Republicans for what he calls their attempt to distract attention from the most pressing challenges of the day — first the coronavirus pandemic and now the national unrest over police violence. ""Sen. Graham sold his conscience in exchange for a better shot at winning his primary,"" a spokesman for Biden's campaign said Democrats, who are in the minority on the Senate Judiciary Committee, took up that theme on Wednesday, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. She also restated that the findings and much of the work of the Mueller era have been validated. Feinstein emphasized with Rosenstein that the infamous, never-verified Russia dossier was not used as the basis to charge anyone. And Rosenstein underlined what he called the important need to conduct investigations that might not necessarily lead to charges — and that in the case of the Mueller era, no Americans ultimately were charged with conspiring with the Russians who attacked the election. Republicans argue the mere fact of a continued investigation into Page — after evidence surfaced they argue should have quashed it — is improper even though Page was never charged. In Rosenstein's case, he signed a request to continue surveillance on Page based on work product that has since been repudiated by internal investigators and the secret surveillance court. Those details didn't become clear to the public — or Rosenstein, he said on Wednesday — until later. Graham said he accepts that explanation but wants to know why information being gleaned by lower-level investigators wasn't making its way to the leadership of the FBI or Justice. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., tried to emphasize with Rosenstein that although the Page surveillance application process was flawed, none of the other surveillance conducted in the Russia investigation suffered from the same problems. The Page problems don't invalidate the rest of the Mueller work, Leahy argued. Other Democrats complained about the use of the time and energy of the Judiciary Committee to execute what Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, R-R.I., called a political errand for Trump. Graham defended what he called the need to excavate the decisions in the Russia investigation and, meanwhile, has sought to show the Judiciary Committee can keep many plates spinning at once. The committee heard from witnesses on Tuesday about the deadly effects of the coronavirus within the federal prison system and Graham also has planned a hearing later this month about race and policing following Floyd's death.

1624292150,2020-06-03 07:59:00,How Much Do We Need The Police?,https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/how-much-do-we-need-police,en,False,"politics and government, labor, blacks, police",138019,boisestatepublicradio.org,http://boisestatepublicradio.org/,"One effect of the widespread protests across U.S. cities this week has been to renew discussions of what role the police should play in society. For many Americans, it goes without saying that the police are critical in maintaining public safety. Have an emergency? Call the police. But many others — especially black people and poor people — have long countered that the police pose more of a threat to their safety than a boon. See a police officer? Walk in the other direction. So it seems like a good moment to talk to Alex S. Vitale. He's the author of the 2017 book The End of Policing. In it, he argues that rather than focus on police reform or officer retraining, the country needs to reconsider fundamentally what it is the police should be doing at all. I spoke with Vitale about what roles police should and shouldn't play, what he makes of the current protests and what actual change in the way police in this country do their jobs might look like. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. One of the arguments you make in The End of Policing is that police are being asked to do too much. They're basically being tasked with addressing every social problem that we have. So what are police asked to do? And what should they be asked to do? One of the problems that we're encountering here is this massive expansion in the scope of policing over the last 40 years or so. Policing is now happening in our schools. It's happening in relation to the problems of homelessness, untreated mental illness, youth violence and some things that we historically associate police with. But the policing has become more intensive, more invasive, more aggressive. So what I'm calling for is a rethink on why we've turned all of these social problems over to the police to manage. And as we dial those things back, then we can think more concretely about what the rest of policing should look like and how that could be reformed. You brought up homelessness. In many cities police are tasked with dealing with people experiencing homelessness — but they don't have many options besides basically moving people or arresting them. Well, we've created this situation where our political leaders have basically abandoned the possibility of actually housing people. Which, of course, is the real solution, supportive housing for those who need extra support. But basically, we have a massive failure in housing markets that is unable to provide basic shelter for millions of Americans. So instead of actually addressing that fundamental problem, we have relabeled it as a problem that is the fault of the disorderly people who we label as morally deficient. And then we use police to criminalize them, to control their behavior and to reduce their disorderly impact on the rest of us. And this is perverse and unjust. So then it places police in this completely untenable situation, because they completely lack the tools to make this problem any better. And yet we've told them it's their problem to manage. ... Part of our misunderstanding about the nature of policing is we keep imagining that we can turn police into social workers. That we can make them nice, friendly community outreach workers. But police are violence workers. That's what distinguishes them from all other government functions. ... They have the legal capacity to use violence in situations where the average citizen would be arrested. So when we turn a problem over to the police to manage, there will be violence, because those are ultimately the tools that they are most equipped to utilize: handcuffs, threats, guns, arrests. That's what really is at the root of policing. So if we don't want violence, we should try to figure out how to not get the police involved. There are obviously a lot of people who agree broadly with the notion that the way that policing happens in this country is a problem and that there needs to be some sort of change. But they're pretty invested in the idea that police are needed to maintain public safety. People ask the question, without police, what do you do when someone gets murdered? What do you do when someone's house gets robbed? What do you say to those people who have those concerns? Well, I'm certainly not talking about any kind of scenario where tomorrow someone just flips a switch and there are no police. What I'm talking about is the systematic questioning of the specific roles that police currently undertake, and attempting to develop evidence-based alternatives so that we can dial back our reliance on them. And my feeling is that this encompasses actually the vast majority of what police do. We have better alternatives for them. Even if you take something like burglary — a huge amount of burglary activity is driven by drug use. And we need to completely rethink our approach to drugs so that property crime isn't the primary way that people access drugs. We don't have any part of this country that has high-quality medical drug treatment on demand. But we have policing on demand everywhere. And it's not working. Obviously, a big part of what is on people's minds right now is the role that police have in dealing with protesters, dealing with different types of political unrest. In your book, you talk a lot about the history of how police have been used to quell social unrest. Can you talk about that history a little bit? Well, I think that one of the myths we have about policing is that it is politically neutral, and that it is always here to sort of create order in a way that benefits everyone. But the reality is that America's social order has never been entirely equitable. We have a long history of exploitation of the Indigenous population, of African Americans through slavery, Jim Crow and today. And while we're not using police to manage slavery or colonialism today, we are using police to manage the problems that our very unequal system has produced. We're invested in this kind of austerity politics that says the government can't afford to really do anything to lift people up. We have to put all our resources into subsidizing the already most successful parts of the economy. But those parts of the economy are producing this huge group of people who are homeless, unemployed, have untreated mental health and substance abuse problems. And then we ask the police to put a lid on those problems — to manage them so they don't interfere with the ""order"" that we're supposedly all benefiting from. But if you're one of those poor people, one of those folks with a mental health problem, someone who's involved in black market activities to survive, then you experience this as constant criminalization. And would you say the same goes for people who are political protesters? Political protest has always been a part of this dynamic, right? Political protests are a threat to the order of this system. And so policing has always been the primary tool for managing those threats to the public order. Just as we understand the use of police to deal with homelessness as a political failure, every time we turn a political order problem over to the police to manage, that's also a political failure. I think the mayor of Minneapolis, for instance: Jacob Frey. He has consistently tried to frame this as a problem of a few bad apples. And he says, ""Why are you protesting? We fired them."" But this completely misunderstands the nature of the grievances. And instead of actually addressing those grievances, he's throwing police at the problem. Are the interactions that are happening right now between police and protesters something that you think is predictable? Or is this something new that we haven't seen before? It's not completely new; it's just the intensity of it compared [with], let's say, five years ago during the Eric Garner and the Mike Brown protests. What we're seeing is really an immediate escalation to very high levels of force, a high degree of confrontation. And I think part of it is driven by deep frustration within policing, which is that police feel under assault, and they have no answer. They trotted out all the possible solutions: police-community dialogue sessions, implicit bias training, community policing, body cameras. And it just didn't work. It didn't make any difference. And so they ran out of excuses. So the protests today are a much more kind of existential threat to the police. And the police are overreacting as a result. If we were to take serious steps toward moving in the direction of having police address fewer of our social problems and putting those problems in the hands of people who are actually more equipped to deal with them, what would be the next step? What is the next thing that we as a country have to push for? I think this will look like a series of local budget battles. And that's really what's going on across the country, is when we have these divest campaigns in places like Los Angeles and Minneapolis and New York and Durham, N.C., and Nashville, Tenn., and Dallas, Texas. These are folks who are saying concretely: ""We don't want police in our schools. We want that money spent in ways that help our children, not criminalize them. We don't want more money for overtime for narcotics officers. We want actual drug treatment programs, safe injection facilities, things that will help people."" So that's what this looks like. It's about rallying city council members and mayors around a new vision of creating healthier communities. When you're looking around at what's happening right now, what are the things that you think people need to understand to really process what is going on around the country? Well, I think the police are making the argument for us, right? People started this conversation by saying policing is out of control; they're not making the situation better. They have not been reformed. Well, now all you have to do is turn on the nightly news and see how true that is. The level of aggression and unnecessary escalation is stark evidence of how unreformed policing is, and I argue how unreformable it is. The question is whether or not people will take it to the next step and ask the tough political questions. Why are our mayors turning this over to the police to manage? Why are we using curfews instead of having conversations? Why are we throwing protesters in prison instead of trying to figure out what's driving all of this anger? ",0.0

SEATTLE — Protesters in Seattle walked for miles Sunday nights. Many in the crowd of hundreds made efforts to keep the peace, trying to avoid scenes of looting an vandalism that played out across downtown Seattle and around the country Saturday night. Meanwhile President Donald Trump, while not referencing Seattle directly, blamed similar acts of destruction across the country on one group. “The violence and vandalism is being lead by Antifa and other radical left wing groups,” Trump said. He added in a tweet that the U.S. will “be designating ANTIFA as a terrorist organization.” Antifa is a militant anit-fascist movement – notorious as violent counter protesters. “I just think that right now the intelligence from what we know there’s not enough information at this point to use this,” said former FBI Analyst Farris Rookstool III. While there have been claims both locally and nationally that protest violence was encouraged by some sort of organized effort – former FBI analyst Farris Rookstool says the government has yet to show a direct tie between the violence and a single group. “It’s more of a knee jerk reaction to brand an entity as terrorist when in fact he hasn’t shown his hand to show what are the mitigating facts the documented proof that actually cause it to fall into that category.”",0.0

PORTLAND, Ore. — Mayor Ted Wheeler told MSNBC he's heard anecdotally that ""out of towners"" were coming to Portland to cause problems at the demonstrations. Wheeler was so concerned about outsiders infiltrating Portland protests, that he closed the exit and on-ramps into the city Sunday night. While there is no way to confirm where the thousands of protesters demonstrating in Portland since Friday live, arrest records show the majority of people arrested live in the Portland metro area. According to the Portland Police Bureau, 102 people have been arrested from the demonstrations since Friday. Based on the available court filings, 26 people listed addresses in Portland, Beaverton, Salem, and Vancouver, Washington. Six people arrested were listed as transient or homeless. One person listed Roseburg, Oregon as his home address and one person was listed as living in Richmond, California. Portland Police Bureau Deputy Chief Chris Davis said it's too early to blame to the bulk of issues on people living outside the metro area. ""It's hard to tell, we have made a large number of arrests but that's a small fraction of those involved in criminal activity,"" said Davis.

The pope is urging the U.S. to reach a national reconciliation, after days of protests and violence. ""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,"" the pope said on Wednesday. He added, ""At the same time, we have to recognize that 'the violence of recent nights is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost.' "" On Wednesday, Francis says, he is joining the faithful in Minneapolis and across the U.S. ""in praying for the repose of the soul of George Floyd and of all those others who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism."" The prayers, he added, would be for consolation for their grieving families, and for reconciliation and peace. In the pope's remarks about violent protests, he was quoting Archbishop José H. Gomez, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who recently issued a statement condemning Floyd's death. In that statement, Gomez asked, ""How is it possible that in America, a black man's life can be taken from him while calls for help are not answered and his killing is recorded as it happens?"" With riots breaking out in many U.S. cities, Gomez cited America's most famous civil rights leader: ""It is true what Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, that riots are the language of the unheard. We should be doing a lot of listening right now."" The pope's message to the U.S. was part of his address during Wednesday's general audience at the Vatican. Here's the full text of that portion of his remarks: ""I greet the English-speaking faithful joining us through the media. ""Dear brothers and sisters in the United States, I have witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest in your nation in these past days, following the tragic death of Mr. George Floyd. ""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life. At the same time, we have to recognize that ""the violence of recent nights is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost,"" ""Today I join the Church in Saint Paul and Minneapolis, and in the entire United States, in praying for the repose of the soul of George Floyd and of all those others who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism. Let us pray for the consolation of their grieving families and friends and let us implore the national reconciliation and peace for which we yearn. May Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mother of America, intercede for all those who work for peace and justice in your land and throughout the world. ""May God bless all of you and your families. """,0.0
