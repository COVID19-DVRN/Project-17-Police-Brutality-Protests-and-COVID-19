His wife, Eleana Tee Cobb, announced on Facebook that her husband died at his New York City home from lung cancer. He was 91. Born in Washington, D.C., Cobb told The Associated Press in 2019 he listened to jazz albums and stayed up late to hear disc jockey Symphony Sid playing jazz in New York City before launching his professional career. He said it was saxaphonist Cannonball Adderley who recommended him to Davis, and he ended up playing on several Davis recordings. But Cobb’s role as a drummer on the “Kind of Blue” jam session headed by Davis would forever change his career. That album also featured Adderley and John Coltrane. The album, released on Aug. 17, 1959, captured a moment when jazz was transforming from bebop to something newer, cooler and less structured. The full takes of the songs were recorded only once, with one exception, Cobb said. “Freddie Freeloader” needed to be played twice because Davis didn’t like a chord change on the first attempt, he said. Davis, who died in 1991, had some notes jotted down, but there weren’t pages of sheet music. It was up to the improvisers to fill the pages. “He’d say this is a ballad. I want it to sound like it’s floating. And I’d say, ‘OK,’ and that’s what it was,” Cobb recalled. The album received plenty of acclaim at the time, yet the critics, the band and the studio couldn’t have known it would enjoy such longevity. He and his bandmates knew the album would be a hit but didn’t realize at the time how iconic it would become. “We knew it was pretty damned good,” Cobb joked. It has sold more than 4 million copies and remains the best selling jazz album of all time. It also served as a protest album for African American men who looked to Davis and the jazz musicians to break stereotypes about jazz and black humanity. Cobb would also work with such artists as Dinah Washington, Pearl Bailey, Clark Terry, Dizzy Gillespie, Sarah Vaughan, Billie Holiday, Wynton Kelly and Stan Getz. He'd also release a number of albums on his own. He performed well into his late 80s and played in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 2017, as part of the New Mexico Jazz Festival. Jazz fans from throughout the American Southwest came to pay their respects in what many felt was a goodbye. Cobb released his last album, This I Dig of You, with Smoke Sessions Records in August 2019. ___ This story corrects a previous version that misspelled the name of Miles Davis. ___ Associated Press writer David Sharp contributed to this piece from Portland, Maine. ___ Contreras reported from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The Star Tribune reported more conflict Wednesday night at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The newspaper also reported looting at a Target store across the street from the station.Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home.

1618215075,2020-05-27 05:00:00,Shuttle Veteran Leads First Human Space Mission Launched From U.S. Since 2011,https://www.kios.org/post/shuttle-veteran-leads-first-human-space-mission-launched-us-2011,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"When NASA astronauts launch from the Kennedy Space Center, it will be the first time humans have blasted off from the U.S. since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011. The pilot of that final shuttle mission was Doug Hurley, and he's aboard again Wednesday, ready to make history with the launch of SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule. When Hurley and his crew cleared the tower aboard Atlantis on July 8, 2011, the future of human spaceflight from Florida was uncertain. Getting to space was going to require hitching a ride on Russia's Soyuz capsules lifting off from Kazakhstan. A U.S. replacement ride was at least four years away. In fact, budget cuts and technical challenges delayed NASA's Commercial Crew program for almost a decade. The $6 billion program aims to launch astronauts to the International Space Station using commercial companies — SpaceX and Boeing. After the final Shuttle mission, Hurley worked at NASA's Johnson Space Center to develop the Commercial Crew Program. In 2015, he was selected as one of the first Commercial Crew astronauts. Now, he will once again fly to space — something that surprises even him. ""I certainly didn't expect to fly again,"" Hurley, who also flew on the Space Shuttle Endeavour in 2009, says. ""I certainly didn't necessarily have a plan to fly again. And if I did it would have had to have been a case where somebody would have wanted me to."" Hurley joined NASA in 2000 as part of an astronaut class that called themselves the Bugs, after the Y2k computer glitch of that year. He was selected for his test-flight skills and had clocked over 5,500 hours in more than two dozen military aircraft before joining the space agency. Terry Virts, a former test pilot turned astronaut who also joined NASA in 2000, says of Hurley: ""He's just solid. He's not going to make any mistakes."" ""He's going to stay cool no matter what happens,"" Virts says. ""He's definitely a very good choice. I know why our bosses picked him for this job."" The focus of this flight, known as Demonstration Mission 2, will put Hurley's test pilot skills to use. He and copilot Bob Behnken are tasked with flying SpaceX's Crew Dragon for the first time. The duo will put the sleek capsule through its paces, flying it using a touch screen and iPads before it docks with the space station. The launch is set for 4:33 p.m. ET and the spacecraft will dock with the station about 18 hours later. The astronauts will spend anywhere from one to four months on the station. Like Hurley, Behnken, another Bug, is a veteran of two shuttle missions, one in 2008 and another two years later. He says Hurley is cool under pressure and dedicated to the mission. ""I always know that Doug is going to be one step ahead of me and ready for whatever's kind of coming in front of us. He's going to be the one who's ready a second and a half before I am."" The mission is a critical test flight that will — if all goes well — pave the way for more astronauts to fly to the station from the U.S. NASA is out of rides to the space station from Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, and Boeing, the second commercial partner, is facing delays getting its capsule certified for launch. Hurley and Behnken will spend 18 hours in space, testing and certifying all of the systems of the Crew Dragon — from flying it in orbit to sleeping on board to testing the spacecraft's toilet. ""You want to know that when it hits the fan, when things don't go as planned, that you have these people with you that will have your back, and that they know you'll have theirs,"" fellow class of 2000 astronaut Nicole Stott, who is now retired from NASA, says. ""That's Doug,"" she says. ",0.0
1618282374,2020-05-27 13:35:00,George Floyd's Death Stokes Calls For Minneapolis Officers To Be Charged,https://www.kios.org/post/george-floyds-death-stokes-call-minneapolis-officers-be-charged-murder,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"Updated at 2:20 p.m. ET Just one day after the death of a black man whose arrest was recorded and posted on social media by a passerby, Minneapolis is grappling with the fallout that has spread beyond city limits. The disturbing video of Monday night's death — during which a white officer's knee was planted firmly on George Floyd's neck and his desperate calls for help were ignored — has prompted protests in the Minnesota city and demands for charges for the officers involved. At a news conference Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to ""act on the evidence before him"" and press charges on the arresting officer. ""Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail? If you had done it or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now. And I cannot come up with a good answer to that question,"" Frey told a news conference Wednesday. ""We watched for five whole excruciating minutes as a white officer firmly pressed his knee into the neck of an unarmed, handcuffed black man,"" he added, noting that the arresting officer was not practicing a technique condoned by the city's police. ""I saw no threat; I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary."" Frey refrained from specifying what charges he would like to see, citing a desire not to impede investigators. But Floyd's sister Bridgett went one step further on national television earlier Wednesday. ""I would like for those officers to be charged with murder because that's exactly what they did,"" she told the Today show. ""They murdered my brother; he was crying for help."" She said the family, which has retained legal representation, is far from satisfied with the announcement that the four officers in the video have been fired — a swift decision that Frey said was ""the right call."" The Minneapolis Police Department has not publicly confirmed the officers' identities, and it said the FBI is also investigating the circumstances of Floyd's death. The announcement also failed to satisfy protesters who on Tuesday evening thronged to the department's 3rd Precinct, where clashes erupted between demonstrators and law enforcement in riot gear. As Minnesota Public Radio reported, the demonstrators damaged the building and a squad car in a confrontation that eventually saw police firing tear gas into the crowd. ""What we witnessed today was state-sponsored murder, a state-sponsored execution,"" Steven Belton, president of the nonprofit Urban League Twin Cities, said at a gathering of local civil rights leaders earlier Tuesday outside City Hall. ""And what we await to see is whether it's going to become state-sanctioned execution. It'll be sanctioned if nothing is done."" The controversy engulfing Minneapolis is not unfolding in a vacuum. Already a video recorded earlier this year in Georgia — depicting the death of an unarmed black man, who was followed and shot by two white men while out for a jog three months ago — has renewed questions about the conduct of local police, who did not arrest the men until after the video surfaced this month. And this week, a recorded encounter in New York City's Central Park caught fire after it was posted to social media. In the video, a white woman calls the police on a black man, who says he had simply asked her to leash her dog while he was out bird-watching. ""He's recording me and threatening me and my dog,"" she tells emergency operators multiple times as the man recording her keeps his distance. After the video surfaced, the woman was fired by her employer, the investment firm Franklin Templeton. The video recorded in Minneapolis more closely called to mind an earlier death in New York City, however. Like Eric Garner, who died after an officer's chokehold in 2014, Floyd's final words before he appeared to lose consciousness were a plea for help: ""I can't breathe."" Floyd is seen wailing the phrase several times with his face planted on the pavement, his hands apparently cuffed behind his back and a male officer kneeling on his neck. Observers standing nearby are heard telling officers that Floyd's nose was bleeding and that he was dying. The officer and his colleagues show little reaction as the man gradually goes silent. The officer does not lift his weight off Floyd's neck throughout most of the video until medical workers arrive to lift him into an ambulance on a stretcher. The New York City police officer who used the chokehold on Garner, Daniel Pantaleo, was never charged with a crime but was fired last year on a judge's recommendation. The Floyd family's attorney emphasized the link with Garner in comments Wednesday to the Today show. ""It's worse than Eric Garner in many ways,"" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said, ""because you hear the people even pleading with them, 'Please get your knee off his neck. Have some humanity; this is a human being,' "" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement Tuesday, ""There must be a complete and thorough outside investigation into what occurred, and those involved in this incident must be held accountable. Justice must be served for this man and his family, justice must be served for our community, and justice must be served for our country."" ",0.0

Like any politician, humans aren't the only ones in the middle of an election cycle. One small town in Vermont appoints a mayor of the four legged variety. Meet Lincoln, a Nubian goat and the first pet mayor of Fair Haven, Vermont, elected to office in 2019. Her campaign caused quite the international stir. I got a phone call from Paris. They wanted to know what was going on. And then this year we made the A rumor times in 2019 the first round of the Pet Mayor race. Just because I think it was the first time this was happening. Word spread, especially in France. They were very interested to know what was happening. What's going on? Why's there go being the mayor? Liz Strep, a a reporter for New Station My NBC five covered the goat mayors rise to political fame and her 2020 bid for re election. But don't worry, Fairhaven isn't actually taking executive orders from a goat. The idea electing an animal mayor really started because the school needed a new playground, their playgrounds. I think 30 years old, it's just really not safe. This slide has a big hole in it, and it's just going down. So as a fund raiser, Teoh get a new playground. They thought of this idea. You know, why don't you let a pet mayor and that will spark donations? That's really their only platform, that these candidates are running forest to raise money. So these animals really aren't making any major decisions in the town. They're really more of a mascot to encourage people to donate money to those students. A new playground Last year's election was pretty small. There were, I believe, three candidates. Lincoln ended up winning. She was a young, spunky little goat, very friendly. So I think that really helped her win that election. Lincoln's first days Mayer was very official, though politicians on four legs do come with their challenges. Last year, Lincoln was attending her swearing in ceremony. She had a little bit of an accident. She lost some for marbles. I guess you could say over things a little bit of a commotion there, but it was very entertained. She made her mark. You could say that wasn't one of her final. She, I guess, had a pretty successful first term, which is why she was seeking re election this year. The pet election turned out to be a huge hit both in and out of Fairhaven. So when the 2020 cycle began, competition was fierce because last year was such a big success. And there was so much publicity about Lincoln becoming the town's first pet mayor. A lot of students in the Fairhaven grade school wanted to nominate their own pets, so we had a bunny, a hamster old horse. I think there were five or six dogs. Five acts. There were 18 candidates. There were three main candidates that stood out to voters. Lincoln, the incumbent goat, Sammy, the police canine. And Murphy, the therapy dog. Lincoln at a very successful first term as mayor being an incumbent. A lot of people knew her name already that she was definitely a front runner. She raised. I think, about 1000 or so dollars for the playground, but the goal is $80,000. They really need to raise a lot more money. Murphy thinks reading is important for kids. He thinks having a safe place to play and be outside and get off their phones. This has important. Murphy, a therapy dog, volunteers at the Bear Even grade school, so students were already very familiar with Murphy and Spur. These owner also had several fund raisers during his campaign, though he raised about $500 before the actual town meeting day vote for the school's playground. We were amazed that we were able to raise that much. And then there, Sammy, but police canine Sammy was actually a rescue dog. All the kids were very from there with her, and they're always I wanted her to come in and pay a visit. Do you get to vote today? Welcome to the election stuff Surveying the voters at the polls. A lot of them were very interested in what the name of the animal waas, but also how cute they were. Why do you want to be the war? Said She's so you want 4 to 9 semi because he's true. Why did you want pizzazz? He's cute, and she likes the log on leashes out polling place on town meeting day. A few of the candidates were outside kind of doing a meet and greet with the kids, though I think that could have swayed some of the undecided voters if they had a good experience. He's feeling great. You got to greet all the kids coming to vote. So it was his day. Well, I think she's hungry. That's about yet She's been nibbling on the building. It's a different sort of a day for Everybody Loves Dogs. And then there's even a greater population of love. Police K Nights, Theo Day after a town meeting day, I was in the classroom with a bunch of eighth graders who are counting ballots, and we were there as the results came in. I won't Lincoln doing because I wanted Lincoln personally because he leaves a lot of money for the playground. Last year, I will say this. Eighth grade class WAAS Chris Stan's Class Kristan is Lincoln's owner, so they were a little biased. They really, really were pretty for Lincoln to win. It's my pleasure to announce the winner of the mayoral race fair in Vermont this year. There are a winner is Murphy the dog with 146 votes. When it was announced over the speaker that Murphy had one, there was a little bit of the side. They were a little disappointed, but it didn't take long for them to start cheering and applauding for Murphy. They were very excited that passing the torch on and it's a new year. I think they're looking forward to seeing what Murphy will do with his mayoral seat. I think Murphy will do a great job with the playground fun, so I really wanted him from that store sampling to win. Yeah, I asked him. He didn't care, but he's a new playground and an excuse to see adorable animals weren't the only benefits to the 2020 pet election. The kids were able to learn valuable lessons about exercising their voting rights. Your vote is your voice in the Democratic process. You have a lifetime of voting ahead of you, and I have to take that chance. Every opportunity you get. At the end of the day, this whole pet mayor raises to raise money for the playground, but also to really introduce kids to the importance of voting and taking election seriously, getting to the voting booth and making your voice heard. That's a right that we all have. You know, where U. S citizens and starting that process really early and getting Kate's excited about this process. That's really built goal of all of this. It doesn't matter who wins the playground, the kids, that's what it's about. They haven't reached their goal yet for the playground, but they're really helping that. Murphy can pulls through and get a lot of donations during his time as mayor. And, of course, we had to know. Will this small Vermont town ever hand over the mayoral office to a human? I don't think that there haven will have a human mayor anytime soon. Because Fairhaven has a human town manager, which is essentially sort of the same thing as a mayor. He makes a lot of the big decisions. He oversees that select board. So I think the town government is free, comfortable with just having a town manager. But I think they also really love having a pet mayor. If you'd like to donate to the Fairhaven Grade School Playground Fund, check out the link to the go Fund me in the description box. I'm Alexander Stone, and from everyone here it dispatches from the middle. Thanks for watching",0.0

""After careful study of developments over the reporting period, I certified to Congress today that Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under United States laws in the same manner as U.S. laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997,"" Pompeo said in a statement released Wednesday. ""No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground."" The secretary announced his decision at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China. President Trump has blamed Chinese authorities for failing to prevent the coronavirus from becoming a global pandemic, noting that his administration is ""not going to take it lightly."" And earlier this month the Senate trained its legislative fire on China, with a unanimously passed bill that could force some foreign companies off U.S. stock exchanges. The State Department also has pushed back hard against China's recent plans for an aggressive new security law that would criminalize behavior in Hong Kong seen as critical of Beijing. In a statement shortly after news of the proposed legislation surfaced, Pompeo called it ""a death knell for the high degree of autonomy."" For more than two decades, the semiautonomous region has been governed under a principle Beijing calls ""one country, two systems,"" which allows Hong Kong certain freedoms from the communist economic and legal systems practiced on mainland China. Partly for that reason, the U.S. treats Hong Kong as separate from the rest of China as long as the city remains sufficiently autonomous. But the relationship between Beijing and Hong Kong's residents has grown increasingly fraught in recent years, with the city periodically erupting into massive demonstration against what protesters and the U.S. call Beijing's attempts to encroach on its freedoms. The region again saw clashes between protesters and riot police last weekend. One of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, Joshua Wong, urged leaders abroad to reconsider whether its ""special trade status can still be held since, once the law is implemented, Hong Kong will be assimilated into China's authoritarian regime, on both rule of law and human rights protections."" Now, that status appears in jeopardy with the Trump administration's reappraisal. ""Hong Kong and its dynamic, enterprising and free people have flourished for decades as a bastion of liberty, and this decision gives me no pleasure,"" Pompeo said Wednesday. ""But sound policymaking requires a recognition of reality. While the United States once hoped that free and prosperous Hong Kong would provide a model for authoritarian China, it is now clear that China is modeling Hong Kong after itself.""

People were choking, gasping and some throwing up as they scattered, leaving only a few still in the streets.As police and National Guard troops took up positions with plastic shields on major streets, crowds melted away.

1618898970,2020-05-28 05:49:14,Mayor: Officer who put knee on man’s neck should be charged,https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/Mayor-Officer-who-put-knee-on-mans-neck-should-be-charged-570825961.html,en,True,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges against the white police officer seen on video kneeling against the neck of a handcuffed black man who complained that he could not breathe and died in police custody. Demonstrators shut down the Hollywood Freeway in Los Angeles on Wednesday, May 27, 2020, during a protest about the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis earlier in the week. (Source: AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving. “I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white. He later added: ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired — an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. Conflict erupted again Wednesday at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police. News helicopter video appeared to show looting of nearby stores, including a Target, a Cub Foods and an auto parts store, with no evident police intervention. Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door. Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete. Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests. “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department's culture. “One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said. The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota’s two top law enforcement officials — Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black — promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn't endorse the mayor’s call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out. “I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it’s important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,” Ellison said. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd's death had “outraged us and people across the country” and that the case “deserves the best we can give.” The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. Floyd’s death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others. Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis “a very, very sad event"" and said his administration was going to “look at it.” Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited. Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd's death was “part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country” and ""cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.” It also “sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,"" Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, ""but I don’t think that’s enough.” A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally. Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told the AP. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store. It was unclear why Floyd was arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks. A Minneapolis Fire Department report shows that paramedics moved Floyd from the scene, and two fire crew members got into the ambulance to help. Medics were doing chest compressions and other lifesaving measures on an “unresponsive, pulseless male,” the report said. Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital. An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to his death. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. Chauvin's attorney confirmed the officer's identity on Tuesday. The department identified the other officers Wednesday as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. In calling for charges, the mayor contrasted Floyd's death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers. “We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,"" Frey said. ""There’s somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes — every one of which that officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd's neck.” ___ Long reported from Washington.

A Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an AutoZone store also showed signs of damage and looting, and windows of businesses in nearby strip malls were reported to be smashed out. At least one person was killed. Police spokesman John Elder told USA TODAY that the department was investigating a homicide near the area where a reporter from the Star Tribune newspaper tweeted that a looter had been shot and killed by a pawn shop owner. One person was in custody early Thursday, the Star Tribune reported, but police wouldn't confirm if the victim was a looter. “The facts of what led up to the shooting are still being sorted out. We are truly in the infancy of this investigation,” Elder said. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said.

The rally began with about 40 people holding signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop killing black people” and “Silence is violence.” Protesters were largely silent, with occasional chants of “no justice, no peace” and the names of black men and women who had been killed by police officers. Passing drivers — and one ambulance — honked in support and waved or gave thumbs-up. Within an hour, however, the protesters were met by two counter-protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Facebook group Confederate 901. Theryn C.

Brutality. Reprehensible. Indefensible. Police nationwide, in unequivocal and unprecedented language, have condemned the actions of Minneapolis police in the custody death of a handcuffed black man who cried for help as an officer knelt on his neck, pinning him to the pavement for at least eight minutes. But some civil rights advocates say their denunciations are empty words without meaningful reform behind them. Authorities say George Floyd was detained Monday because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, and the 46-year-old resisted arrest. A bystander's disturbing video shows Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd's neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. “There is no need to see more video,” Chattanooga, Tennessee, Police Chief David Roddy tweeted Wednesday. “There no need to wait to see how ‘it plays out’. There is no need to put a knee on someone’s neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don’t have an issue with this ... turn it in.” There is no need to see more video. There no need to wait to see how “it plays out”.

If you wear a badge and you don’t have an issue with this...turn it in. pic.twitter.com/frNCAWCeq6 — David Roddy (@ChiefDavidRoddy) May 27, 2020 The reaction from some law enforcement stands in stark contrast to their muted response or support for police after other in-custody fatalities. Sheriffs and police chiefs have strongly criticized the Minneapolis officer on social media and praised the city’s police chief for his quick dismissal of four officers at the scene. Some even called for them to be criminally charged. “I am deeply disturbed by the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered in the street with other officers there letting it go on,” Polk County, Georgia, Sheriff Johnny Moats wrote on Facebook. “I can assure everyone, me or any of my deputies will never treat anyone like that as long as I’m Sheriff. This kind of brutality is terrible and it needs to stop. All Officers involved need to be arrested and charged immediately. Praying for the family.” Typically, police call for patience and calm in the wake of a use of force. They are reluctant to weigh in on episodes involving another agency, often citing ongoing investigations or due process. Not going hide behind “not being there.” I’d be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission. The act of one, impacts us all. — Chief Eddie Garcia (@sjpdchief) May 27, 2020 “Not going hide behind ‘not being there,’"" tweeted San Jose Police, California, Chief Eddie Garcia. ”I’d be one of the first to condemn anyone had I seen similar happen to one of my brother/ sister officers. What I saw happen to George Floyd disturbed me and is not consistent with the goal of our mission. The act of one, impacts us all.” But Gloria Browne-Marshall, a civil rights attorney and professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said she wouldn't be a “cheerleader” for a “handful” of chiefs who harshly decried the officers' behavior. “Any minute progress is seen as miraculous because so little has been done for so long,” she said. “It’s nothing close to progress or what outrage would be taking place if it was a white man as the victim of this assault.” Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter in Los Angeles, said she wasn't “particularly moved” by the relatively few police who voiced outrage. Abdullah said the three other officers who witnessed Chauvin's actions and did not intervene contributed to a long-standing system of police racism and oppression against people of color. “We’ve got to remember that it was not just Officer Chauvin who was sitting on George Floyd’s neck,” she said. Abdullah and hundreds of others protested what she called Floyd's lynching on Wednesday night. Some blocked lanes of a freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Minneapolis is bracing for more violence after days of civil unrest, with burned buildings, looted stores and angry graffiti demanding justice. The governor on Thursday called in the National Guard. On Thursday night, protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon. The heads of the Los Angeles and Chicago departments — both of which have been rocked before by police brutality scandals — addressed Floyd's death and its potential effect on race relations between law enforcement and communities of color. Even the New York Police Department weighed in. Eric Garner died in the city in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and uttered the same words Floyd did: “I can't breathe.” It took city officials five years to fire the officer, and no criminal or federal charges were brought. #GeorgeFloyd died on the ground under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer.

It was wrong,"" NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea wrote Thursday. “We must take a stand and address it. We must come together, condemn these actions and reinforce who we are as members of the NYPD. This is not acceptable ANYWHERE.” Before he was commissioner, Shea spearheaded the NYPD’s shift to community policing that moved away from a more confrontational style favored by other commissioners after Garner's death.

Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor’s mother hours after gunshots erupted during protests late Thursday outside City Hall. One person was in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police said Friday. Mayor Greg Fischer said police officers fired no shots. Instead, they provided aid to the wounded, he said. TV video showed terrified protesters fleeing as gunfire erupted. With more rallies planned, Taylor's mother joined the chorus of calls for protests to remain peaceful. In her statement, Tamika Palmer said her daughter — an emergency medical technician — devoted her life to others and the ""last thing she'd want right now is any more violence."" ""Please keep saying her name,"" her statement said. ""Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let's do it the right way without hurting each other. We can and we will make some real change here. Now is the time. Let's make it happen, but safely."" On Friday evening, what appeared to be several hundred people gathered downtown for the second night of protests. The crowd briefly blocked traffic near City Hall and chanted, ""No justice, no peace."" Protesters carried signs calling for justice for Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, the black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported. A police officer was seen on camera during a WAVE-TV broadcast firing what appeared to be pepper bullets directly at the camera crew. ""I'm getting shot! I'm getting shot!"" WAVE-TV reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera. She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away. Police spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said no shots had been fired at Friday's protest as of 10:40 p.m. and no significant injuries had been reported. Two people were arrested. Bracing for more protests, police said they wouldn't tolerate violence or property destruction. ""We value the right to free speech and understand this community has a lot to say right now,"" Louisville police Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous said. ""We hear you."" But she added that police were prepared to ""take whatever action we must to try to ensure no one else is injured during this time of unrest. We ask the community to please voice your opinions in a peaceful way."" Meanwhile, Louisville's mayor said the use of no-knock warrants by police was being suspended, the latest in a series of policy changes and others actions in response to Taylor's death. ""To the people who gathered downtown last night to protest, and to many more throughout our city and throughout our country who feel angry, hurt, afraid, frustrated, tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law enforcement, I hear you,"" Fischer said. Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, he said. Beshear, speaking on CNN, said Thursday's protest started peacefully but some people later ""turned it into something that it should not have been."" Local Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey termed the protest as ""a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed,"" the Courier Journal reported. ""What I'm seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration."" The Louisville protests followed the release of a 911 call Taylor’s boyfriend made on March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. Hundreds of demonstrators marched through downtown Louisville, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. Windows were broken and several vehicles were damaged during the unrest, police said. Shots were fired into government buildings, including police headquarters, they said. Bricks were thrown into buildings and graffiti was splashed in several places, including a firefighter memorial, they said. The police description of the damage made no reference to any looting. Jordan Basham, a 24-year-old white bartender, said she was a few feet from where the people were shot. As people fled in terror, a man she didn't know pushed her to the ground, told her not to move and used his own body to shield her, she said Friday. ""I'll never be able to get that picture out of my mind,"" she said. ""But I am still very glad that I was there. As long as they're out there protesting, I'll be back."" Many protesters wore masks as Kentuckians are strongly urged to follow health guidelines to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Attention on Taylor's death has intensified since her family sued the police department this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia in February and the recent death of Floyd. Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn't provide a number.“No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians.The protests stretched for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down.“Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor's mother. “As Breonna's mother says let's be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice.”Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.Attention on Taylor's death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month.

We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.”Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up around Louisville City Hall. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd.Chants from protesters early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets?

Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence a day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. Protesters on Thursday torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and vandalized dozens of businesses. The Pentagon took the rare step Friday of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. Ben Hubert, 26, of Minneapolis, said he wasn't surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. ""I'm outraged,"" he said of the Floyd case. ""But I'm also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It's been swelling for years."" Downtown, thousands of protesters encircled a police station after the 8 p.m. curfew. ""Prosecute the police!"" some chanted, and ""Say his name: George Floyd!"" There was no violence, though some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. The renewed protests came after Officer Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He also was accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd, who was black, had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd's family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities ""felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator."" As the night dragged on, more fires erupted on the south side: A Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank, another restaurant, an Office Depot. Many burned for hours. Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted that firefighters could not respond until areas were secure. He said the city was working with the National Guard and the state to ""provide support in the south."" Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd's death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. ""You are disgracing our city,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. ""You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country."" Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd's back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, ""No, staying put is where we got him."" Lane said he was ""worried about excited delirium or whatever."" An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd's system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as ""awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself."" After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, the complaint said. Chauvin's attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the ""extraordinary speed"" in charging the case four days after Floyd's death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the ""horrible"" video recorded by a bystander. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the ""abject failure"" in responding to this week's protests and called for swift justice for the officers. Walz said the state took the lead after the police station burned. ""Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,"" Walz said. President Donald Trump said Friday that he'd spoken to Floyd's family and ""expressed my sorrow."" He called video of the arrest ""just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it."" Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd's family, asked to take custody of Floyd's body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd's death. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Aaron Morrison and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, Bernard Condon in New York, and James LaPorta in Delray Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.

George Floyd was handcuffed when a Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground pressing his knee across his neck. Floyd later died. His death has also brought protesters out here in Omaha. Protest organizers Omaha want the community to stand up and speak out against injustice About 50 people gathered outside of Omaha’s Northeast Police Precinct to protest the death of George Floyd. RELATED: OPD condemns Minneapolis officers' actions in George Floyd's death Anthony Baker organized the protest, saying he believes its time that African American men stand up and become active in their community. “I feel that the black man been marginalized and part of that problem is we, as black men, have not spoken out. It's easily 'out of sight, out of mind,' so if we’re not visible — if we’re not speaking out, if we’re not participating, if were not involved, if we're not engaged — it’s very easy for people to look past us to look over us,” Baker said. Retired police officer Tariq Al Amin was on the Omaha force for 25 years. He believes police need better training and that one of the officers watching Floyd beg for his life should have stepped in. “I also felt more should have been done by the officers that are around him to check him to check the officers who had his knee on him to say ok that’s enough let’s get him and get out of here,” Al-Amin said. Protestors here in Omaha say these type of incidents usually play themselves out with a certain formula. Baker said they've heard it all before. “We will not be deterred, persuaded, or influenced by any attempts to discredit him, his family in an effort to justify his murder,” Baker said. All of the Minneapolis Police officers involved in the incident have been fired. Thursday, the mayor of Minneapolis has also called for criminal charges to be filed against the officer seen on video kneeling on Floyd's back. The Omaha Police Department leadership responded to Floyd’s death yesterday through a statement. Part of it reads, “The officers’ actions are not consistent with the training and protocol of our profession. We commend Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo for his decisive actions and leadership.”",0.0

Tim Walz promised that journalists would not be interfered with in reporting on violent protests following the death of George Floyd. CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was arrested live on air from the unrest in Minneapolis on Friday morning. (Source: CNN) CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and two colleagues were released within an hour after network chief executive Jeff Zucker called Walz to demand answers about why they were led away and held in a police van. ""We have got to ensure that there is a safe spot for journalism to tell this story,"" Walz said. Jimenez and colleagues Bill Kirkos and Leonel Mendez were doing a live shot for CNN's ""New Day"" shortly after 5 a.m. Central Time, describing a night of fire and anger in the wake of Floyd's death after a Minneapolis police office knelt on his neck. Fired officer Derek Chauvin was charged with murder in that case later Friday. When first approached by officers, Jimenez, who is black, told them, ""put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way."" After being told he was being arrested and his hands were tied behind his back, Jimenez asked why he was being arrested. He did not get an answer. The Minnesota State Patrol said on Twitter that the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were ""clearing the streets and restoring order"" following the protests. The patrol said the CNN journalists ""were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media."" It's not clear why they were confused: Jimenez was holding what appeared to be a laminated ID card before his hands were secured, and his fellow crew members told police that they were from CNN and showing the scene live on the air. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" CNN ""New Day"" co-anchor John Berman said. After being released, Jimenez said that he was glad that his arrest was shown on the air. ""You don't have to doubt my story,"" he said. ""It's not filtered in any way. You saw it for your own eyes. That gave me a little bit of comfort. But it was definitely nerve-wracking."" At a later news conference, Walz said that ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like that should happen ... This is a very public apology to that team."" The arrest drew widespread condemnation across the news industry. CNN competitors MSNBC, CBS News and Fox News all issued statements in support of Jimenez, along with the Society of Professional Journalists and the National Association of Black Journalists. CNN accepted Walz's apology, saying the network appreciated the sincerity of his words. Walz's words in support of journalists have impact at a time when the news media is often under attack, said Jane E. Kirtley, Silha Professor of Media Ethics and Law and director of the Silha Center at the University of Minnesota. ""It's really important for the governor to make that kind of statement to emphasize to everyone, especially law enforcement, that the press has an important job to do ... and they need to be respected,"" said Kirtley, who lives blocks away from the protests and could still smell smoke from the fires on Friday. Later Friday, the network was again thrust into the story when hundreds of protesters confronted police outside CNN's downtown Atlanta headquarters. Activists spray-painted a large CNN logo outside the building, breaking a window and tagging doors. One protester climbed on top of the CNN sign and waved a ""Black Lives Matter"" flag to cheers from the crowd. As anchor Chris Cuomo opened his prime-time show, he told viewers the network's headquarters had been ""swarmed and defaced."" Footage of the damage outside was mixed with scenes from other protests around the country. Correspondent Nick Valencia reported from inside the building as protesters hurled objects at the building and police. ""This is our home, Chris, you know, this is where we come to work every day, journalists who are trying to tell the truth, trying to deliver information. ... And these demonstrators have decided to come here today to take our their frustration and anger it seems not just on police but on our CNN center as well,"" Valencia said. Meanwhile, there were signs Friday that cable news networks, who were spending much of their time covering the story, have become sensitive to the impact of showing witness video of Floyd's treatment by police. News anchors on all three networks usually warned viewers of its graphic nature before showing the video. ""I must warn you that this is difficult to watch,"" said CNN's Brianna Keilar, ""but it is important to remember."" ___ Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Aaron Morrison in New York and Television Writer Lynn Elber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

Submit Privacy Notice A CNN crew was arrested while covering Minneapolis protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Hide Transcript Show Transcript Omar, It is so good to see you. That was quite a scene of what you've just endured for the past hour. Can you tell us what happened? Well, we saw a lot of it play out on TV there. There seemed to be a little bit of confusion as to what what was supposed to or what was allowed to happen. Now, well, as we're reporting, we had been in verbal contact. At least it seemed, with some of the police officers saying, All right, where can we be? We have heard we played some of it as they were giving out commands for people to clear the area. And we saw that as protesters completely cleared out. And that, of course, came after there was an hour and 1/2. Or at least where we're standing, where there was no sort of police presence. So as people came down, we saw them walking down the block, and whether repress or not, we wanted to make sure we were out of the way. So you so we basically stepped onto the corner is where we were. And I think the moment before the arrest actually happened was we saw at least 11 protester or Allison, who was not media sort of run past us. And that person was cornered by State Patrol was the main unit that seemed to be there. And after that person was apprehended, they then turned toward us now, and that was the first moment I could say that police had gotten behind us. So in a sense, we were sort of surrounded by state patrolman, and it seemed like Minneapolis police officers as well. But again, it was that moment where all of a sudden someone runs past and there are already on edge based on the absolute destruction that's all around them. And that arrests happened just right in front of the Minneapolis Third Precinct. That, of course, went up in flames last night. Omar, I'm not sure you know this, but our cameras were not only rolling the whole time you were taken into custody, but the cameras continue to roll. Frankly, for the entire ride to the precinct, we could see the picture for the whole time. First of all, let me also say, Omar, what an amazing job you did throughout that your composure and your ability to keep your cool is a testament to your professionalism. Um, which we already knew about by how great of a job you're doing covering the story on the streets there. You and your team did a terrific job. Now what we did not hear, even though we saw the transportation, is from the moment you were lead away until the moment you were just released. So can you please tell us what took place while you were in custody? Well, everyone to their credit, was pretty cordial after that happened. So it seemed I was actually talking to the officer that was leading me away. I was like, And then we're gonna be out here for the next few days. What is the guidance of where we should be? If you don't want us that close, where should we? Because we're under the impression that that was OK. And he said, Look, I don't know, man. I'm just following orders, so I don't know who is potentially giving that order in that particular moment. But as far as the people that were leading me away, they there was no animosity there. They weren't they weren't violent with me. We're having conversation about just how crazy this week has been for every single part of the city. And like I mentioned, a lot of these people are on edge. And as we were walking by, we saw a person on the edge of sort of the perimeter that they had formed. And this wasn't a protester. This was just a a random it seemed citizen, who was saying, Hey, I need to get back into my place over there. And where were you when this neighborhood? Completely about the short. I mean, we saw where they were. They were in the middle of what became a focal point of anger, passion, violence, even at times and there they were forced to retreat. And then this morning, literally within a matter of minutes, we saw all of them swarm back in clearing out these protesters from the city level. That's we saw the fire department and Police Department come in. And then the State Patrol was advancing as we're seeing up that street toward our location. Now, where we were standing basically to my right, was where all the protesters were outside or in front of the the building that was on fire and into our left was where they were advancing. So we were basically just going to try and step back and let them continue to advance down the street. But again, you saw what unfolded there. But as far as what happened in between again, they were They were pretty cordial. Once we're in the trucks as well. They were were downtown. Obviously, this is the Hennepin County Public Safety Building here. They're all pretty pretty good with us. Onda conversation. Well, that's a relief, Omar, because you could not have been more professional. You were doing your job by the book. You presented your credentials. You told them that you were a journalist. You told them that you were within and you told them you were. They were. You were live on the air. I mean, you did them the courtesy of explaining that we were live on the air at that moment. And I'm just wondering, after you and your crew were arrested, at what point did they? I mean, did they ever say sorry, that was a mistake. Or when they released you, Was there an explanation of that? That had all been a big misunderstanding or mistake and you're allowed to report there. That conversation may have happened above some of the people that were with for us. It was literally a situation off. Tell me who you are. Me as far as identification purposes than they left. And they came back and said, You're with CNN, Correct? Yes. And then we explained that to other team members that were with me on three, including the security that we that we had hired for this. And then they left, came back and then let us out of the van, were inside the van, handcuffed the whole time. And then we were sat down, waited for a little bit more, and then from there, that was when they eventually came back with our with our belongings that they confiscated. Over the course of this, they had they unclipped our handcuffs. And then that is when we were let out. And again, it's answer your question. There was no sort of sorry. This is a big misunderstanding, blah, blah, blah, because it seems that conversation may have happened. But it didn't happen with us in particular, but also is the difference of jurisdiction. Just just one more question because it was It was a nerve racking moment for all of us watching. You know, Bakari Sellers just described watching it and saying that it was really emotional and heart pumping for him because he was scared for you and other people watching. Given the backdrop of everything that's happening in Minneapolis, he was scared for you at this moment when you were being taken into custody. You know, I should also let you know that Josh Campbell, who was reporting a block or two away from you, was not taken into custody. He was treated quite politely. Were you scared when this was happening? And do you have any idea why you were arrested and not Josh Kim? Well, there was a moment, I would say, minutes after it happened, where things started to sink in a little bit. I think I don't have to tell you Alison or John that sometimes when you're in this job in these scenarios, there's a lot of adrenaline pumping. You're trying to focus and balance so many different factors. In a case like this, I'm tryingto balance what the actual story is, how the story line is advancing while also trying to be aware of our surroundings, which at times can get dangerous. So there's that mentality, and then the arrest happened. I was still trying to communicate with you all as this was going on, because I was just confused as you. We have been showing our credentials throughout this entire week, and especially in the moments leading up to that. So I couldn't really understand what was going on. But as we were walking away and you're sort of taking in the entire neighborhood that had been completely decimated again from the passion of the protesters and unfortunately, some of the rioting and looting that we had seen. It did cross my mind that what is really happening here, and the one thing that gave me a little bit of comfort was that it happened on live TV. There has been this When you talk within the community about, let's just say what's happened with George Floyd. There's always a discussion that what's happening isn't new. It's being filmed, and that speaks to the power of having something happen on camera because you can have people speak up for you without you saying anything. And that gave me a little bit of comfort knowing that you guys saw what was happening. I was living what was happening, and the country was seeing what was happening unfold in real time, right before their eyes. You don't have to doubt my story. It's not filtered in any sort of way. You saw it for your own eyes, and that gave me a little bit of comfort, but it definitely was nerve racking a certain point.",0.0

1620063870,2020-05-29 06:13:00,Cliven Bundy Armed Standoff Case Going Back To Court,https://www.kios.org/post/cliven-bundy-armed-standoff-case-going-back-court,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"It's been more than two years since Cliven Bundy left the federal courthouse in downtown Las Vegas a free man. His arm around his wife, Carol Bundy, the Nevada rancher was defiant. ""We're not done with this,"" Bundy told reporters in January 2018. ""If the federal government comes after us again we will definitely tell 'em the truth."" On Friday, the Justice Department will try to come after the Bundys again, when federal prosecutors will appeal for a retrial over a 2014 armed standoff between Bundy, his militia and federal agents who had come to round up the rancher's cows that were illegally grazing on federal land. The government's case against Cliven Bundy, his sons, Ammon and Ryan and a Montana militiaman named Ryan Payne, collapsed after a judge declared a mistrial in December 2017. Bundy and his men were accused of conspiracy against federal agents and other charges for their role in the tense standoff which later became a symbol over the fight against federal control of public lands. ""If there is no successful prosecution, it's going to encourage a lot of anarchists like the Bundys to take actions that not only are a threat to themselves but threats to the public at large,"" said Pat Shea, who served as BLM director during the Clinton administration. Retrial effort criticized For their part, the Bundys and their supporters appear puzzled that the federal government is even pursuing a retrial. ""What's really ironic and frankly I think disgusting is that the Trump Justice Department is the one that allowed the U.S. attorney in Nevada to take the appeal,"" said Larry Klayman, Cliven Bundy's attorney. After all, President Trump recently pardoned two Oregon ranchers whose fight with federal land managers inspired Cliven Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, to lead a separate, armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016. Federal prosecutors mostly failed to get convictions in that Oregon case and have been widely criticized for bungling the Nevada trial. Judge Gloria Navarro dismissed the case and later declared a mistrial after ruling federal prosecutors ""deliberately misled"" defense attorneys and the court by failing to provide evidence from surveillance cameras and to disclose the existence of federal snipers near the ranch in the days leading up to the April 2014 standoff. The U.S. attorney's office in Nevada declined an interview request by NPR. But court filings indicate prosecutors will likely argue Friday that their missteps in the 2017 trial were ""inadvertent,"" and in particular they say they were trying to balance disclosing Bureau of Land Management surveillance footage with protecting witnesses against violence. Klayman, who is himself a controversial conservative activist and was once fixture in the ""Birther"" movement, says the DOJ is being hypocritical. He says the investigation against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was recently dropped, but not his clients. ""If you're one of the Washington elite and establishment in the nation's capital, you get special treatment,"" Klayman said. ""If you're Cliven Bundy and his sons and the peaceful protesters, basically you don't."" Most of the federal agents and land managers who were at the 2014 standoff say it was anything but a peaceful protest. Photos and social media posts showed militia training their rifles on armed BLM officers who had come to round up Bundy's cattle. Cliven Bundy has refused to recognize the federal government's ownership of millions of acres of public land — including in Nevada. The rancher has consequently not paid federal fees owed for grazing his cows on land near the Lake Mead National Recreation Area since the 1990s. Pandemic ""resuscitates"" movement Retired federal land managers like Pat Shea have expressed outrage over the government's continued failure to prosecute the Bundys, whose cows continue to graze — for free — on land that's now protected as a national monument. The Bundys' original dispute over grazing goes back decades, stemming from tensions between ranchers and environmentalists and the city of Las Vegas, as it began rapidly expanding into a protected desert tortoise's habitat. Bundy was seen as the last rancher in southern Nevada who refused to get out of the business. But in the years since, his critics say the family's fight has devolved into far right extremism, and a widely debunked legal theory that counties and states, not the federal government, should own public land. ""It's like the COVID-19 virus, they mutate as to their belief system so much that you can never tell what they're going to advocate,"" Shea said. ""They are a danger to themselves and a danger to everyone else they come in contact with."" Indeed, the pandemic has lately brought an opportunity to breathe new life to the Bundys and their self-described patriot movement that had been seen as starting to fade. Ammon Bundy and some of the family's followers have been traveling across the West leading protests against coronavirus public health restrictions, protests that thus far haven't drawn huge numbers. At one recent march in Washington state that was streamed on Facebook, activist Kelli Stewart decried the business closures: ""Come on guys, this is the American way, open rebellion to tyrannical laws, we're not slaves."" A rebellious fight against tyranny, or justice against a family that has flaunted the law for decades, that's a question now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The court takes up the appeal for a retrial in USA vs. Bundy in a virtual session on Friday. ",0.0

1620150601,2020-05-29 10:11:00,Minneapolis Seethes Over George Floyd's Death As Trump Calls Protesters 'THUGS',https://www.kios.org/post/minneapolis-seethes-over-george-floyds-death-trump-calls-protesters-thugs,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"Updated at 10:56 p.m. ET Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer involved in George Floyd's death on Monday, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced the charges Friday, shortly after Chauvin was taken into custody by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The announcement comes days after the release of a video that shows Chauvin's knee pressed firmly on the black man's neck for at least seven minutes. That video has inspired outrage nationwide and unrest in Minneapolis and had led to Chauvin's firing as well as that of three other officers seen in the video. Asked why Chauvin wasn't arrested earlier — something demanded by protesters and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — Freeman said his office moved as quickly as possible in its investigation. He added that the three other former officers remain under investigation and that he anticipates charges for them, too. The Department of Justice is also conducting an investigation on ""a separate and parallel track,"" U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Friday in a statement. ""Both state and federal officers are working diligently and collaboratively to ensure that any available evidence relevant to these decisions is obtained as quickly as possible,"" Barr said. Those investigations, coupled with the officers' firings, has so far failed to satisfy the protesters who had gathered for a third night Thursday in Minneapolis. Some of them stormed the 3rd Police Precinct, the closest precinct to the site of Floyd's arrest, setting fire to that building after police withdrew in an attempt to mitigate tensions. Rioters burned and looted other buildings in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The region has seethed since the release of the video depicting Floyd's arrest, which shows Floyd crying for help before falling silent, while bystanders shout that he's dying. The officer did not remove his knee until paramedics showed up to move Floyd's unresponsive body into an ambulance. He was reported dead later Monday night. In an attempt to avoid another night of chaos, officials ordered a nighttime curfew in Minneapolis and St. Paul beginning at 8 p.m. local time Friday and Saturday nights and continuing until 6 a.m., although the curfew was widely ignored. Here is the latest on the situation: Floyd's family: ""We want a first-degree murder charge"" Floyd's family said that prosecutors have made ""a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice,"" in a statement issued shortly after the announcement that Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. But they feel that authorities haven't gone far enough. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested. We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer,"" the family said in a statement shared by their attorney. In Minnesota, a third-degree murder conviction can result in up to 25 years in prison, while murder in the first degree brings a possible life sentence. ""The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw,"" the family added, ""and is spilling out onto streets across America."" Gov. Tim Walz: ""I understand clearly there is no trust"" During a news conference Friday morning, the Minnesota governor acknowledged the pain of those outraged by Floyd's death in police custody — whose name he added to a list of ""unheard"" black men killed by police, including Philando Castile, who was shot in 2016 by police in a suburb of St. Paul. ""The very tools that we need to use to get control to make sure that buildings aren't burned and the rule of law doesn't collapse are those very institutional tools that have led to that grief and pain. I understand clearly there is no trust in many of our communities,"" Walz told reporters. ""But I'm asking you to help us use humane ways to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice, so that those that are expressing rage and anger and demanding justice are heard."" President Trump's tweet about ""THUGS"" flagged for glorifying violence The president, who called Floyd's death ""very sad and tragic"" earlier this week, said early Friday that he had told Minnesota's governor that ""the Military is with him all the way."" He also described the source of the unrest as ""THUGS"" — a word widely criticized for bearing racial overtones. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" he continued in a tweet partially hidden and flagged by Twitter for violating its policy against ""glorifying violence."" Trump did not miss the social network's decision. Not long after the move, the president — who signed an executive order Thursday aimed at limiting the legal protections afforded to social media companies such as Twitter — took aim at the company with a tweet saying it ""will be regulated."" Trump later sought to clarify his initial tweet, saying that shooting simply can occur when looting gets out of hand. ""It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,"" Trump explained in a pair of tweets. ""It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media."" In a tweet of his own, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said he is ""furious"" that Trump ""is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many."" Gov. Walz apologizes for brief arrest of CNN crew On Friday morning, state police arrested a CNN crew while it was reporting about the unrest on live television: ""A black reporter from CNN was arrested while legally covering the protests in Minneapolis,"" the network pointedly noted. ""A white reporter also on the ground was not."" The crew of correspondent Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez was released about an hour later, and Walz repeatedly apologized during his news conference Friday. ""A few minutes after hearing [about the arrest] I was on a call with CNN President Jeff Zucker, who demanded to know what happened. I take full responsibility,"" Walz said Friday. ""There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen. Calls were made immediately. This is a very public apology to that team. It should not happen."" The swift backtrack did little to soften the shock of the spectacle, though. ""With all the perversions of American democracy that we have witnessed, few rival the dystopian spectacle of a U.S. journalist calmly reporting the news and repeatedly offering to reposition his crew at the police's request, only to be arrested, cuffed and hauled away alongside his crew,"" said Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America, advocacy group that fights for press freedom. She added: ""For us at PEN America, where we routinely document the arrest and imprisonment of writers and journalists worldwide, the action was eerily familiar, but something we expect to see in authoritarian states: Turkey, Hong Kong, Egypt. To see it in the United States of America is appalling."" Obama and others nationwide respond to Floyd's death Demonstrators in Minneapolis are not alone in their outrage over Floyd's death. Activists spilled onto city streets across the country, holding protests seeking justice for the Minneapolis man as well as other unarmed black men and women who have died at the hands of law enforcement officers or in police custody. Large protests were held outside the White House and outside the CNN headquarters in Atlanta, as well as in cities including New York, Houston and San Jose, Calif. Among those who took to social media to express their pain and frustration Friday was former President Barack Obama. ""It's natural to wish for life 'to just get back to normal' as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly 'normal' – whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park,"" Obama said in a statement posted to social media. In speaking of jogging and bird-watching, the former president referred to two other videos that have inspired outrage this month — one in which a black man was followed and killed by two white men while out for a run in Georgia, and another in which a white woman called police on a black bird-watcher in New York City after he asked her to leash her dog. ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" Obama said. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" My statement on the death of George Floyd: pic.twitter.com/Hg1k9JHT6R — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 29, 2020 Protesters have turned out to express their outrage as far as Los Angeles and New York City. Meanwhile in Louisville, Ky., demonstrators gathered Thursday to protest death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot by police during a no-knock raid on her home in March. Those protests turned violent, as well, with several people reported shot amid the melee. As one protester in Minneapolis told NPR, the anger over Floyd's death is about more than just one man — it's about how police treat black people across the U.S. ""This is how our people react, you know? When we've been done wrong for so long,"" he said. ""So, me, I'm just praying and hoping everybody makes it home safe."" NPR's Adrian Florido contributed to this report. ",0.0

The FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death.Hundreds flocked downtown Thursday night, and on Friday, it happened again — people demanding justice in the death of Taylor, as well as two minority men recently killed.Details of the case remained quiet for several weeks, but gained national attention after video of the Ahmaud Arbery shooting death in Georgia was made public. Activists across the country began speaking out about the deaths of unarmed black citizens at the hands of police and/or racist white people.In March, Taylor was shot at least eight times when three officers forcibly entered her apartment to serve a search warrant in a narcotics investigation. The department said the men announced themselves and returned gunfire when Taylor's boyfriend fired at them.But in a wrongful death lawsuit, Taylor's mother says the officers didn't knock at all and should've called off their search because the suspect they sought had already been arrested.Officers didn't find drugs in her apartment when they entered, Taylor's mother said in the lawsuit.In the weeks leading up to Thursday’s violent protest, Taylor’s family called for the LMPD officers involved in the case to be relieved of their duties and charged. Activists held a candlelight vigil, a parade and a wreath-laying ceremony to bring attention to the case. The events were all held peacefully, and Taylor's mother said she would like it to remain that way. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported.A police officer was seen on camera during a WAVE-TV broadcast firing what appeared to be pepper bullets directly at the camera crew.“I'm getting shot! I'm getting shot!” WAVE-TV reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera. She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away.Seven people were shot during Thursday’s rally. Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, Mayor Greg Fischer said. CNN contributed to this report.",0.0

1620330027,2020-05-29 14:02:37,LIVE: Trump to speak on China as it pushes for more control in Hong Kong,https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/Trump-to-speak-on-China-as-it-pushes-for-more-control-in-Hong-Kong--570869191.html,en,True,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced Friday he would withdraw funding from the World Health Organization, end Hong Kong’s special trade status and suspend visas of Chinese graduate students suspected of conducting research on behalf of their government — escalating tensions with China that have surged during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has been expressing anger at the World Health Organization for weeks over what he has portrayed as an inadequate response to the initial outbreak of the coronavirus in China’s Wuhan province late last year. The president said in a White House announcement that Chinese officials “ignored” their reporting obligations to the WHO and pressured the organization to mislead the public about an outbreak that has now killed more than 100,000 people in the United States. “We have detailed the reforms that it must make and engaged with them directly, but they have refused to act,” the president said. “Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating the relationship.” The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. Trump said the U.S. would be “redirecting” the money to “other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs,” without providing specifics. He noted that the U.S. contributes about $450 million to the world body while China provides about $40 million. Critics of the administration’s decision to cut funding called it misguided, saying it would undermine an important institution that is leading vaccine development efforts and drug trials to address the COVID-19 outbreak. “Severing ties with the World Health Organization serves no logical purpose and makes finding a way out of this public health crisis dramatically more challenging,” said Dr. Patrice Harris, president of the American Medical Association. Sen. Chris Murphy called it a distraction that would “hand over” the organization to China. “Leaving castrates our ability to stop future pandemics and elevates China as the world’s go-to power on global health,” said the Connecticut Democrat. The WHO declined to comment on the announcement. Officials of the U.N. agency have not directly addressed a letter that Trump sent to the general director on May 18, warning he would make permanent a temporary freeze on U.S. funding and reconsider U.S. membership unless it committed to “major substantive improvements within the next 30 days.” Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate health committee, also warned that the president’s decision could interfere with vaccine trials and international cooperation during future outbreaks. “Certainly there needs to be a good, hard look at mistakes the World Health Organization might have made in connection with coronavirus, but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with, not in the middle of it,” said Alexander, echoing a point made by others, including the head of the United Nations. At a later event Friday, Trump was asked about relations with China and he repeated his earlier suspicions about how the country managed to apparently contain the virus in Wuhan while it spread to Europe and the United States. “Well, we’re certainly not happy with what happened with respect to China,” he told reporters. Tensions over Hong Kong have been increasing over the past year year as China has cracked down on protesters a nd sought to exert more control over the former British territory. Trump said the administration would begin eliminating the “full range” of agreements that had given Hong Kong a relationship with the U.S. that mainland China lacked, including exemptions from controls on certain exports. He said the State Department would begin warning U.S. citizens of the threat of surveillance and arrest when visiting the city. “China has replaced its promised formula of one country, two systems, with one country, one system,” he said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notified Congress on Wednesday that Hong Kong is no longer deserving of the preferential trade and commercial status it has enjoyed from the U.S. since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. It’s not yet clear what impact the decision will have on U.S. companies that operate in Hong Kong or on the city’s position as Asia’s major financial hub, or how China will react to the decision. “The downward spiral in the bilateral relationship has now reached lows not seen since the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen massacre, and there is little reason to expect things to get better soon,” said Dexter Tiff Roberts, an Asia expert at the Atlantic Council, which publishes non-partisan policy analysis. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who is a commissioner of the Congressional Executive Commission on China, praised the decision on Hong Kong as an overdue response to the government of President Xi Jinping for human rights abuses, including against religious minorities in the Xinjiang region. “After years of human rights admonishment and cheap rhetoric devoid of any meaningful penalties, Xi has concluded that the West is all talk, no action,” Smith said. “President Trump, however, is today beginning to change that and is doing what previous presidents have failed to do.” The president also said the U.S. would be suspending entry of Chinese graduate students who are suspected of taking part in an extensive government campaign to acquire trade knowledge and academic research for the country’s military and industrial development. Allowing their continued entry to the country would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States,” Trump said in an order released after the White House announcement. Revocation of the visas has faced opposition from U.S. universities and scientific organizations that depend on tuition fees paid by Chinese students to offset other costs and fear possible reciprocal action from Beijing that could limit their access to China. The order issued by the president included an exemptions for students whose work was not expected to benefit the Chinese military. China seemed to signal in recent days that it was hoping to ease tensions. Premier Li Keqiang told reporters on Thursday that both countries stood to gain from cooperation, and to lose from confrontation, because their economies have become so interconnected. “We must use our wisdom to expand common interests and manage differences and disagreements,” Li said. Still, the country has insisted that its control of Hong Kong is an internal matter and it has disputed that it mishandled the response to the virus. —— Associated Press writers Kevin Freking in Washington and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report.

1620446165,2020-05-29 13:56:00,Obama On George Floyd's Death And The 'Maddening' Normalcy Of Racism,https://www.kios.org/post/obama-george-floyds-death-and-maddening-normalcy-racism,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"Former President Barack Obama says he shares the ""anguish"" that many feel about George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minnesota. Floyd's death has sparked days of protests in Minneapolis. President Trump blamed the unrest on ""thugs"" in a tweet that was later hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence."" Read Obama's full statement below, including a reference to a viral video of a song by Keedron Bryant, who pleads, ""I just want to live, God protect me."" I want to share parts of the conversations I've had with friends over the past couple days about the footage of George Floyd dying face down on the street under the knee of a police officer in Minnesota. The first is an email from a middle-aged African American businessman. ""Dude I gotta tell you the George Floyd incident in Minnesota hurt. I cried when I saw that video. It broke me down. The 'knee on the neck' is a metaphor for how the system so cavalierly holds black folks down, ignoring the cries for help. People don't care. Truly tragic."" Another friend of mine used the powerful song that went viral from 12-year-old Keedron Bryant to describe the frustrations he was feeling. The circumstances of my friend and Keedron may be different, but their anguish is the same. It's shared by me and millions of others. It's natural to wish for life ""to just get back to normal"" as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly ""normal"" — whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park. This shouldn't be ""normal"" in 2020 America. It can't be ""normal."" If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better. It will fall mainly on the officials of Minnesota to ensure that the circumstances surrounding George Floyd's death are investigated thoroughly and that justice is ultimately done. But it falls on all of us, regardless of our race or station — including the majority of men and women in law enforcement who take pride in doing their tough job the right way, every day — to work together to create a ""new normal"" in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.

""We've been angry since George Floyd's death, and we have wanted to speak out; this was our first chance to do so,"" said Tami Damian. Lincoln Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird expressed her condolences to Floyd's family and all those harmed by the violence committed against African Americans. ""Not only do these tragedies harm the family and loved ones of those who are lost but they weaken the very fabric of our entire society,"" Gaylor Baird said, adding that Chauvin must face justice. ""We all must continue to address and rectify systemic racism in our society whenever and wherever we find it."" Retired Public Safety Director and former Lincoln Police Chief Tom Casady posted a tweet the night before saying the officer should've been arrested right away. ""Here’s my take: within 24 hours someone should have had the presence of mind to simply arrest the officer for criminal homicide — just like anyone else. An arrest is not a conviction. He’s still entitled to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. But he should be treated like anyone else.""",0.0

ALL OF THEM WERE PEACEFUL, PROTESTING WITH SIGNS. AS THE DAY WENT ON, DEMONSTRATORS SLOWLY STARTED TO HEAD INTO THE STREET AND STARTED TO SURROUND SOME COP CARS. LAW ENFORCEMENT DEPLOYED TEAR GAS. PEPPER BALLS. SINCE THEN, IT HAS BEEN HOURS OF DEMONSTRATORS AND LAW-ENFORCEMENT GOING BACK-AND-FORTH ON THE STREETS. MOM FORSTMANN TRYING TO PUSH PEOPLE OUT OF THE WAY.

HE HAS FOLLOWED EVERYTHING FOR US FOR SEVERAL HOURS TONIGHT. HE IS LIFE RIGHT NOW. -- LIVE RIGHT NOW. >> VERY BUSY. A DRASTIC DIFFERENCE SINCE YOU SAW MY REPORTS EARLIER. A LOT OF THE AREA HERE HAS PRETTY MUCH BEEN CLEARED OUT BY PROTESTERS. ONE THING YOU CAN SEE IS THE SEE OF POLICE LIGHTS THAT IS OUT HERE AT THIS INTERSECTION. AND A SPEED CERTAINLY MAKING THEIR PRESENCE KNOWN. I’M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN HEAR THAT SOUND. THAT’S A HELICOPTER. LET’S GET INTO VIDEO HERE. WE HAVE VIDEO OF A COUPLE PROTESTERS WHO WERE TAKEN UNDER ARREST. IF YOU SAW MY REPORTS EARLIER, WE DID SEE AT LEAST ONE PERSON WHO WAS TAKEN, PUT UNDER ARREST. IT APPEARED AS THOUGH HE HAD A WEAPON IN HIS HAND. A COUPLE PEOPLE TELL ME IT APPEARS TO BE A 12 GAUGE. I DID SEE LAW-ENFORCEMENT TAKE THAT MEN UNDER ARREST AND A COUPLE OTHER PROTESTERS ALSO. A LOT STILL HAPPENING HERE. AT LEAST AT THIS HOUR AS WE HEAD TOWARDS MIDNIGHT, A LOT DIFFERENT OUT HERE THIS EVENING. I’M NOT SURE IF WE HAVE SOUND HERE, IF WE WANT TO GO TO PROTESTERS ARE NOT.

A COUPLE SECONDS AGO, THERE WERE A COUPLE DIFFERENT PROTESTERS OUT HERE. THEY WERE DAMAGING SOME OF THE PROPERTY, THE GARDEN AREA THAT YOU SEE WHEN YOU ARE PULLING AT THE CROSSROADS MALL. I COULD HEAR A LOT OF CRASHING SOUNDS. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH SOME PEOPLE WERE OVER THERE DAMAGING SOME SORT OF PROPERTY. JUST TO REITERATE, AS WE HEAD INTO THE MIDNIGHT HOUR, A DIFFERENT SCENE OUT HERE. IF YOU SAW ME AROUND 9:00, YOU KNOW THIS STREET WAS FLOODED WITH PROTESTERS. THERE IS STILL LAW-ENFORCEMENT HERE. THEY ARE MAKING THEIR PRESENCE KNOWN. MANY PROTESTERS HAVE SINCE DISPERSED FROM THIS AREA. >> THANKS. PROBABLY A LOT OF CERAMIC POTS THAT ARE EASY TO SMASHED. THE CROWD, WAY CLEARER THAN EARLIER ON IN THE NIGHT. OUR ASSISTANT CHIEF PHOTOGRAPHER WAS AT THE POLICE COMMAND LOCATION. HE TALKED WITH SOME OF THE POLICE COMMAND STAFF. WE HAVE HIM ON THE PHONE FOR US TONIGHT. WHAT WAS THE MESSAGE AND WHAT HAVE YOU SINCE LEARNED IN THE HOURS THAT THIS HAS DEVELOPED? >> THE MESSAGE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS THEY WANTED THIS TO BE A SAFE AND DELIBERATE PROTEST. THEY WANTED FOLKS TO VOICE THEIR OPINIONS AND GET THEIR PASSIONS OUT, BUT TO DO IT IN A SAFE MANNER. MANY FOLKS DID THAT. SOME OF THEM CHOSE TO ESCALATE THINGS. WE GOT PHOTOS FROM EARLIER HERE. RIGHT AT THE BEST BUY AT 76 AND DODGE. SOME THINGS TOSSED THROUGH THE WINDOWS. RIGHT IT SHIELDS DOWN, THE BLAST DOORS. NO FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE STORE AS FAR AS I’M ABLE TO SEE. AS THE DEPUTY TOLD US EARLIER TONIGHT, THROUGH THE OMAHA POLICE SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS, THEIR GOAL WAS TO HAVE A DELIBERATE AND SAFE PROTEST. WHEN THEY FELT THE SITUATION WAS BECOMING UNSAFE, SEEING THINGS THAT WERE A POTENTIAL ISSUE, THEY CHOSE TO CHANGE THEIR ACTIONS AND TRY TO MAINTAIN THAT SAFETY. HERE’S A BIT OF WHAT THE DEPUTY CHIEF HAD TO SAY. >> PUBLIC SAFETY IS IN A MOST CONCERN. FREEDOM OF SPEECH. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY INVOLVED IS SAFE, INCLUDING THE OFFICERS. WHEN A CRUISER OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IS AROUND IT, THINGS ARE GOING TOWARDS THE DIRECTION OF IT BEING UNSAFE OR PROPERTY BEING DAMAGED. WE CAN’T HAVE THOSE THINGS HAPPEN. WE ARE TRYING TO USE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF FORCE POSSIBLE. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. >> I WILL TELL YOU, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THE POLICE STRESS IS THAT THEY WANT FOLKS TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS AREA. I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, FOLKS ARE NOT LISTENING. I’M SEEING CARS MEANDER THROUGH THE PARKING LOTS, DRIVING UP AND DOWN THE ROADS. THESE WERE FOLKS THAT ARE ATTEMPTING TO LEAVE. THEY WANT TO COME TAKE A LOOK. OFFICERS ARE ASKING YOU NOT TO DO THAT. THEY ARE TRYING TO SECURE THIS AREA. PASSERBY IS GOING TO MAKE THEIR JOBS MORE DIFFICULT AND COULD POTENTIALLY GET SOMEBODY IN A REALLY BAD SPOT. THAT’S ALL WE ARE SEEING DOWN HERE AT 76 AND DODGE. >> THESE LIVE PICTURES, TEAR GAS, PEPPER BOMBS, SOMETHING WE JUST SAW OFFICERS DEPLOYED THERE. ARE YOU STILL ON THE LINE WITH US >> YES I AM. >> AS THE NIGHT HAS PROGRESSED, WE’VE OBVIOUSLY SEEN THE CROWD DIMINISHED IN SIZE. I’M NOT SEEING A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH SIGNS ANYMORE THAT ARE TRYING TO GET THAT PEACEFUL MESSAGE ACROSS. IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE SEEING ON THE GROUND? A LOT OF PEOPLE MILLING ABOUT. >> THE NUMBER OF FOLKS I’VE SEEN STANDING AND WALKING ALONG HERE HAS DIMINISHED GREATLY. I’M SEEING A LOT OF CARS GOING THROUGH THE LOTS HERE. CARS CUTTING UP AND DOWN 70 63. WORKING THEIR WAY ALONG CAP. AS A MATTER OF FACT, AS I WAS WALKING UP THE WAY AND COMING UPON THE DAMAGE THAT WE SAW HERE AT 76, THE BEST BUY, SOME YOUNG FOLKS WITH SIGNS STOPPED AND LOOKED IN MAJOR TO SAY, I CAN’T BELIEVE SOMEONE WOULD DO THAT. THERE ARE PROTESTERS, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY, WHO ARE NOT HERE TO VANDALIZE, TO DAMAGE, DO THAT THING. I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS ARE ASKING QUESTIONS IF THAT WAS THE BEST OPTION. THAT’S WHAT WE ARE SEEING AT THIS POINT, HOPING THAT FOLKS WILL HE THE OFFICERS ADVICE TO TRY TO DIAL DOWN THE SITUATION. STAY OUT OF THE AREA AND CALM THINGS BACK DOWN. >> THESE ARE LIVE PICTURES. ALINA POLICE OFFICERS MOVING DOWN THE STREET TOWARD WHERE OUR CAMERA POSITION IS. I THINK THAT IS 72ND STREET. THEY ARE DEPLOYING THOSE PEPPER BOMBS OR THE TEAR GAS, WHATEVER KIND OF CHEMICALS THEY ARE USING TO DISPERSE THESE PEOPLE AND GET THEM OUT OF THE STREET WHERE THEY ARE STANDING NOW. HOPEFULLY OUR CREW CAN GET OUT OF THAT SITUATION AND HAD TO SAFETY. TONIGHT, WE ARE HEARING LEADERS -- FROM LEADERS OF THE OMAHA BLACK COMMUNITY. PRESS IN LOVE JUNIOR SAYS TONIGHT IN PART, I STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE FAMILY OF GEORGE FLOYD. AND THE PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. I HAVE LIVED MY ENTIRE LIFE BEING ANGRY AND WITNESSED RACISM AND VIOLENCE DIRECTED TO MY PEOPLE. EACH TIME I PRAYED THAT AMERICA WILL RECEIVE A WAKE-UP CALL. NOW I PRAY THAT GOD WILL PREVAIL. ALL OF THIS STARTED DAYS AGO IN MINNEAPOLIS WHEN THIS OFFICER PUT HIS KNEE ON GEORGE FLOYD’S NECK. FLOYD LATER DIED AT THE HOSPITAL. TONIGHT, THAT OFFICER IS IN JAIL. HE’S CHARGED WITH THIRD-DEGREE MURDER AND MANSLAUGHTER. THE CHIEF PROSECUTOR IN MINNEAPOLIS SAYS THEY MOVED WITH EXTRA ORDINARY SPEED TO CHARGE HIM. >> I’M NOT INSENSITIVE TO WHAT’S HAPPENING IN THE STREETS. MY OWN HOME HAS BEEN PICKETED REGULARLY. MY JOB IS TO DO IT ONLY WHEN WE HAVE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. WE HAVE IT TODAY. >> PROSECUTORS SAY THEY ANTICIPATE MORE CHARGES AGAINST THE OTHER OFFICERS THAT WE SAW IN THAT VIDEO. THE MINNESOTA GOVERNOR ACTIVATED THE NATIONAL GUARD TO RESTORE THE PEACH. THE MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR ISSUED A CURFEW THAT STARTED TONIGHT AT 8:00 UNTIL 6:00 TOMORROW MORNING. OMAHA’S POLICE CHIEF REACTED QUICKLY AFTER WE ALL SAW THE VIDEO OF A MINNEAPOLIS POLICE OFFICER WITH HIS NEON GEORGE FLOYD’S NECK. THE CHIEF SAYING MONDAY, THE MINNEAPOLIS ARREST WAS DISTURBING. THIS IS FROM THE CHIEF. WHILE NOT ALL OF THE EVIDENCE IS OUT, THE VIDEO IS 90% OF THAT EVIDENCE. THOSE ACTIONS WERE CLEARLY INCONSISTENT WITH THE ACTIONS AND TRAINING OF OUR PROFESSION. THE OMAHA CHIEF ADDED, IT’S IMPORTANT IS BEGAT WHEN THINGS ARE WRONG AND WHEN THINGS ARE RIGHT. TONIGHT IN MY CONVERSATION VIA TEXT WITH OMAHA MAYOR JEAN STOFFER, SHE SAID SHE’S PLANNING A PRESS CONFERENCE TOMORROW WITH THE CHIEF TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE EVENTS THAT UNFOLDED HERE LOCALLY, ADDRESS THE PROTESTER CONCERNS, AND TALK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY HERE IN OMAHA AND THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. A CITY COUNCILMAN TOLD US, THIS IS VERY UNFORTUNATE BUT NOT UNEXPECTED. PEOPLE ARE TIRED. I DO NOT CONDONE VIOLENCE BUT I’M ALSO TIRED OF LIP SERVICE ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGE.

WAVE 3 News reporter Kaitlin Rust appeared to have been hit by pepper balls, reportedly fired by a police officer, during a Friday night protest in downtown Louisville, Kentucky. (Source: WAVE/Gray News) It was previously reported that the officer was firing rubber bullets, but LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said the department’s officers do not use rubber bullets, and it was likely that was Rust and Dobson were hit with pepper balls. Halladay commented again on the incident during a Saturday morning briefing with Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. “We believe it was one of our SRT officers; we are still trying to identify which officer,” Halladay said. “Targeting the media is not our intention. There was a lot going on last night, and to be fair to both the officer and to Kaitlin, we need to take a deeper look at what happened and what prompted that action. So we have said that we will do that and if there needs to be discipline we will address it.” In response to what happened to Rust and Dobson, WAVE 3 News General Manager Ken Selvaggi issued a statement saying, “We strongly condemn the actions of the LMPD officer who tonight repeatedly fired at and hit our reporter and cameraman, both of whom were courageously and lawfully covering breaking news in their community. There is simply no justification for the Louisville police to wantonly open fire, even with pepper balls, on any journalists under any circumstances.” The statement also said “When the officer fired at Ms. Rust and Mr. Dobson, the two had been following police instructions, were standing behind the police line when they were fired upon, and were not disrupting or otherwise interfering with law enforcement.” During night two of several hundred protesters gathering downtown in wake of protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, crowds appear to be larger and police are continuing their efforts to clear the area. A WAVE vehicle was found vandalized downtown as the crowd intensified. Louisville protesters want action taken against three LMPD officers involved in the death of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor, a black woman, in March. She was shot during a no-knock warrant that was being served at her home. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced Friday morning no-knock warrants would be suspended in the city. “To people who gathered downtown last night to protest,” Fischer said, “and to many more throughout our city and throughout our country who feel angry, hurt, afraid, frustrated, tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law-enforcement, I hear you.” He also spoke of unity and thanked Taylor’s family for speaking out against the Thursday night protests that resulted in seven people being hit by gunfire and vandalism. “This is the challenge of our time that we must rise to,” Fischer said. “So let’s rise to the challenge of this moment and work for the truth, work for peace, work for justice for Breonna Taylor, her family and for all of the people of our city. They deserve it. We deserve it.” Copyright 2020 WAVE via Gray News. All rights reserved.",0.0

Twenty-nine-year-old Cody Holte of the Grand Forks Police Department was killed and Grand Forks County Sheriff’s Cpl. Ron Nord was injured. There was no rioting or looting following the shooting so it didn’t get the same attention as the death of a man in Minneapolis, caused by a police officer. There was a peaceful demonstration by the police and the public and the city lit one of the bridges and City Hall in blue to honor Holte, who was also a First Lieutenant in the North Dakota Army National Guard and left behind a wife and young son. Support Local Journalism Donate  The officers were shot in the line of duty delivering an eviction notice, something that they do frequently. A woman in the house was also killed. The outpouring of support has been coming in from all over the state and region, and the Grand Forks Police Department has started a memorial fund for Holte’s family. My heart goes out to Holte’s family and peace officers everywhere who risk their lives to protect and serve us. I didn’t know what happened in the incident in Minneapolis where a police officer killed a black man because the mainstream media only reported on what happened and not why it happened. I didn’t know why they stopped the man or if he resisted arrest because the reporting did not explain this. So I went on the internet and looked up the Minneapolis Police Department this is what I found, “On Monday evening, shortly after 8:00 pm, officers from the Minneapolis Police Department responded to the 3700 block of Chicago Avenue South on a report of a forgery in progress. Officers were advised that the suspect was sitting on top of a blue car and appeared to be under the influence. Two officers arrived and located the suspect, a male believed to be in his 40s, in his car. He was ordered to step from his car. After he got out, he physically resisted officers. Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress. Officers called for an ambulance. He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance where he died a short time later.” For some reason, the mainstream media leaves out the “resisting arrest” part of the story and are concentrating more on race relations, which I think is making the situation worse. I don’t condone police brutality but I think everyone needs to step back and give authorities the chance to examine what happened and, if needed, take appropriate action. Well this is my rant for the week. I had to write about this because I’ve been bombarded by video of the looting going on in Minneapolis and I am totally disgusted by the images and the one-sided reporting.

1620703544,2020-05-30 02:21:01,Pentagon puts military police on alert to go to Minneapolis,https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/Pentagon-puts-military-police-on-alert-to-go-to-Minneapolis-570888721.html,en,True,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"The Pentagon said Saturday it was ready to provide military help to authorities scrambling to contain unrest in Minneapolis, where George Floyd’s death has sparked widespread protests, but Gov. Tim Walz has not requested federal troops. People set a fire during continued protest Friday, May 29, 2020, in Minneapolis. Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. Jonathan Rath Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said several military units have been placed on higher alert ""as a prudent planning measure"" in case Walz asks for help. The Associated Press first reported on the potential deployments and, citing sources with direct knowledge of the orders, named four locations from which soldiers would be drawn. Hoffman did not identify the units, but other officials said they are mainly military police. Hoffman said these are units normally on 48-hour recall to support state authorities in the event of crises like natural disasters. They are now on four-hour alert, Hoffman said. Defense officials said there was no intent by the Pentagon to deploy any federal forces to Minnesota unless Walz asked for help. If he did make such a request, federal units such as military police could provide logistical and other kinds of support to the Minnesota National Guard or state law enforcement, but would not get directly involved in law enforcement under current plans, the officials said. They were not authorized to discuss the planning publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Hoffman said Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had spoken to Walz twice in the past 24 hours and told him the Pentagon was prepared to help if needed. Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, the adjutant general of the Minnesota National Guard, said the Pentagon's decision to place some military units on a higher state of alert for potential deployment was ""a prudent move"" that gave Walz more options. Earlier, Alyssa Farah, the White House director of strategic communications, told the AP that the deployment of active-duty military police to Minnesota was untrue. In an email, she referred to Title 10, the U.S. law that governs the armed forces and would authorize active duty military to operate within the country ""False: off the record - title 10 not under discussion,"" said Farah. No off-record agreement was negotiated with the AP. President Donald Trump urged Walz and other authorities in Minnesota to ""be tough"" in Minneapolis. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call our military, and we can have troops on the ground every quickly,"" Trump said. Soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders. Soldiers in Fort Carson, in Colorado, and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. The people were not were not authorized to discuss the preparations publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The get-ready orders were sent verbally on Friday, after Trump asked Esper for military options to help quell the unrest in Minneapolis after protests descended into looting and arson in some parts of the city. Trump made the request on a phone call from the Oval Office on Thursday night that included Esper, national security advisor Robert O' Brien and several others. The president asked Esper for rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to one of the people, a senior Pentagon official who was on the call. The person said the military units would be deployed under the Insurrection Act of 1807, which was last used in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial. Another official said Saturday, however, that federal troops could be deployed to Minnesota without invoking that act. In that situation, they would perform non-law enforcement duties such as providing logistics help. ""If this is where the president is headed response-wise, it would represent a significant escalation and a determination that the various state and local authorities are not up to the task of responding to the growing unrest,"" said Brad Moss, a Washington D.C.-based attorney, who specializes in national security. Members of the police units were on a 30-minute recall alert early Saturday, meaning they would have to return to their bases inside that time limit in preparation for deployment to Minneapolis inside of four hours. Units at Fort Drum are set to head to Minneapolis first, according to the three people, including two Defense Department officials. Roughly 800 U.S. soldiers would deploy to the city if called. Protests erupted in Minneapolis this week after video emerged showing a police officer pressing his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopping moving and pleading for air. Floyd later died of his injuries. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. The protests turned violent and on Thursday rioters torched the Minneapolis Third Police Precinct near where Floyd was arrested. Mayor Jacob Frey ordered a citywide curfew at 8 p.m. local time, beginning on Friday. In that city, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring the curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. Active-duty forces are normally prohibited from acting as a domestic law enforcement agency. But the Insurrection Act offers an exception. There was no indication Saturday that Trump intended to invoke that act. It would allow the military to take up a policing authority it otherwise would not be allowed to do, enforcing state and federal laws, said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor who specializes in constitutional and national security law. The statute ""is deliberately vague"" when it comes to the instances in which the Insurrection Act could be used, he said. The state's governor could ask Trump to take action or Trump could act on his own authority if he's determined that the local authorities are so overwhelmed that they can't adequately enforce the law, Vladeck said. ""It is a very, very broad grant of authority for the president,"" he added. —— LaPorta reported from Delray Beach, Florida. Associated Press reporters writers Lita. C.

Some gathered for the George Floyd protest Friday night, May 29, 2020, at 72nd & Dodge streets in Omaha made their way to nearby stores after Omaha Police ordered them to disperse. Windows were broken out at the Target store at this location as the retail chain drew protesters around the country for its association with Minneapolis, where Floyd's death occurred.

OPD said the protest remained peaceful ""for the most part."" Unverified Omaha Police scanner reports around 7:45 p.m. indicated about 1,000 had gathered and that the crowd had begun moving east along Dodge Street.

Protests continued across the country overnight as outrage grows over the death of George Floyd. (Source: CNN) The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday, racially diverse crowds held mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities, though many later descended into violence as had happened the previous night. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno's city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota, to shattered windows at police headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. — In Indianapolis, police were investigating ""multiple shootings"" downtown, including one that left a person dead, amid the protests. Police gave few details but said no officers were involved. — In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. — In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. — In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah's governor. Demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire, and another vehicle was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. — In Los Angeles, protesters chanted ""Black Lives Matter,"" some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. A graffiti-covered police car burned in the street. — And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground, and it was unclear if anyone was hurt. ""The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They're repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people,"" Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Not all protests devolved into violence. In Juneau, Alaska, law enforcement officers joined elected officials and residents at a peaceful protest in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city's waterfront. ""We don't tolerate excessive use of force,"" Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told the gathering. Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. ""The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,"" said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. ""It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities."" Minneapolis' streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to ""quell this situation."" Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. ""l live here. I haven't been able to sleep,"" said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd's death but disagreed with the violence: ""Wrong doesn't answer wrong."" Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring ""No games!"" and saying police in New York City ""must be allowed to do their job!"" Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd's death. ""The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,"" Biden said in a statement Saturday night. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Seattle. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an ""invisible enemy."" The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, and a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. ""Quite frankly I'm ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. ""Yes, you caught us off balance once. It's not going to happen twice."" This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd's death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd's neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would ""have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen."" Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S. Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

ALMOST EVERY OFFICER IN OMAHA PUTS HIS LIFE ON THE LINE TO PROTECT AND SERVE THE CITIZENS OF OMAHA. THAT IS WHAT THEY DO DAY AFTER DAY. SOME OF THEM LOSE THEIR LIFE IN THEIR JOBS. WILSON, JASON PRATT, CARRIE ROSCOE, THOSE ARE JUST EXAMPLES OF OMAHA POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE TRULY OUT THERE TO PROTECT AND SERVE AND TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY. RIGHT NOW, WE ALL HAVE AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. WHAT IT IS, WHAT HAPPENED IN MINNESOTA WAS WRONG AND WE BELIEVE IT WAS WRONG. BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN OMAHA IS SHOW THE COMMUNITY THAT WE ARE STILL HERE TO PROTECT AND SERVE AND TO LISTEN TO WHAT OUR CONSTITUENTS AND WHAT OUR CITIZENS ARE SAYING AND TO CONTINUE WITH THE GREAT WORK THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED IN OMAHA OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. THE DIFFERENCE THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH GREAT COMMUNITY RELATIONS HERE. ANOTHER THING WE HAVE DONE IN OMAHA IS WE HAVE CREATED A CITIZEN COMPLAINT REVIEW BOARD. AS I SAID, I HAVE GREAT TRUST IN CHIEF SCHMADERER AND HIS COMMAND STAFF. HE TAKES IT WITH SERIOUS, HE INVESTIGATES, HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE HAS TERMINATED. THE CCRB’S EIGHT CITIZENS BORE THAT GOES A STEP BEYOND THAT. WE -- A CITIZENS BOARD. THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE ANOTHER CHANNEL SO THAT THEY CAN INVESTIGATE WITH CITIZENS A COMPLAINT ABOUT AN OFFICER IN THE CITY OF OMAHA. WE HAVE WORKED VERY VERY HARD TO WIN THE TRUST OF THE COMMUNITY. I THINK THE COMMITTEE DOES TRUST THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT BUT WHEN INCIDENT LIKE THIS HAPPENED, WE HAVE A JOB TO DO AND WE WILL DO IT VERY WELL. I WILL ASK CHIEF SCHMADERER TO COME FORWARD RIGHT NOW AND SPEAK AND GO THROUGH THE EVENTS THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY. AGAIN, I REALLY WANT TO STRESS, WE VALUE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. WE VALUE THE RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE PEACEFULLY, BUT WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT AS IT TURNED VIOLENT, VIOLENCE DOES NOT HONOR GEORGE FLOYD. ANGER AND FRUSTRATION ARE NOT SOLVED WITH VIOLENT ACTIONS. LAST NIGHT FOR A WHILE, IT WAS A PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION AND THEN IT DID TURN VIOLENT. WHEN PEOPLE TURN VIOLENT AND THEY DELIBERATELY DESTROYED PROPERTY, THAT IS WHEN THE POLICE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD AND THEY HAVE TO ACT. WITH THAT, WE WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS LATER.

ALL OF THE POSITIVE COMMENTS THAT I HAVE CONSISTENTLY MADE ABOUT OUR GREAT COMMUNITY CONTINUE TODAY. OMAHA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES TOWARD POLICE COMMUNITY RELATIONS, CRIME REDUCTION AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD AS WE STRIVE TO GET EVEN BETTER. I UNDERSTAND THAT SEEING A POLICE OFFICER IN UNIFORM EVOKES A LOT OF EMOTIONS FOR MANY. THE WAY WE RESPOND IN OMAHA IS TO PROVIDE IMPARTIAL ETHICAL AND PROFESSIONAL POLICING SERVICES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR COMMUNITY. IT ALSO MEANS THAT WE WILL SEE OTHER POINTS OF VIEW AND WE WILL STRIVE TO MAINTAIN THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE OF US. I WANT TO THANK A FEW OF OUR PARTNERS FROM LAST NIGHT BECAUSE THEIR INVOLVEMENT AND COOPERATION WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT TO A SAFE RESOLUTION OF LAST NIGHT’S EVENTS. THE NEBRASKA STATE PATROL, I WANT TO THINK THE COLONEL AND ALL OF HIS PEOPLE, THE SHERIFF’S OFFICE OF DOUGLAS COUNTY AND ALL OF THE DEPUTIES, SARPY COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE, SHERIFF DEPUTIES -- SHERIFF DAVIS AND HIS DEPUTIES.

THIS WAS WHEN LAW-ENFORCEMENT ATTEMPTED TO START TO RESTORE ORDER. AT 8:03 P.M., A CITYWIDE CALL FOR ASSISTANCE AS AN OFFICER WAS PUT OUT AS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WERE NEEDED. POLICE CRUISERS WERE SURROUNDED AT THIS TIME. AT 8:20 P.M., OUR RAPID DEPLOYMENT FORCE, I HEAR THE TERM RIOT POLICE, WE CALL IT RAPID DEPLOYMENT FORCE.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, THINGS COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE, BUT THINGS TURNED OUT TO BE OK. WE HAD ONE CIVILIAN INJURY REPORT OF A MINOR NATURE. THERE COULD HAVE BEEN MORE. WE HAD TO INJURED OFFICERS THAT WERE DOCUMENTED. WHEN SAFETY IS COMPROMISED AND LAWLESSNESS STARTS, THAT WILL BE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM THE ORIGINAL MATTER THAT BROUGHT EVERYBODY TOGETHER. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, WE HAVE TO REACT TO THAT. OUR MISSION IS TO DO IT PROFESSIONALLY, LEGALLY, AND APPROPRIATELY. THERE WAS A PROFESSIONAL WAY TO POLICE IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. TAKE TIME OUT OF YOUR LUNCH WHEN A YOUNG CHILD INTERFERES OR INTERRUPTS YOUR LUNCH, THERE WAS A PROFESSIONAL WAY. THERE WAS A PROFESSIONAL WAY TO MAKE AN ARREST.

He said 16 of those arrested were white; two were Hispanic; and three were black. One civilian was injured during the incident, the chief said. Two officers were injured, treated, and released, he said. Damage details Schmaderer reported that 12 businesses in the nearby area — including Sears, Target, Verizon, Hobby Lobby, and Best Buy — had thousands of dollars in damage to windows and stolen items. In addition, he said, 12 OPD cruisers were damaged. One had the word ""ISIS"" carved into it, he said. OPD statement ""We want peaceful rallies,"" Schmader said. ""If there are things we can do in advance, we'll try to do that to make it as safe as possible."" The OPD chief thanked the NSP for their support and said that without them, things could have been worse. ""We do not feel what happened in Minneapolis is appropriate. And that police officer is not a police officer at all,"" Schmaderer said about former officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with murder for Floyd's death. Stothert said all the work done by the police department in the past seven years has been in great strides. ""They have been earning trust for years,"" she said. ""We hope this incident, which was tragic... we hope we can stand back, examine what happened and move on."" RELATED: National Guard mobilized in Atlanta; fatal shooting in Detroit Nebraska & Iowa governors comment Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts issued a statement condemning Floyd's death and said he was appalled and angry. He also condemned the destruction of property in both Lincoln and Omaha. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie have also condemned Floyd's death. In a statement issued Saturday morning, Reynolds said: “The unsettling and criminal act of violence that robbed George Floyd of his rights and his life was unconscionable and must be met with swift justice. As Iowans, it is right for us to react in different ways, from sadness to outrage. But it is never right to react with violence."" Cownie commented on protests in Des Moines and said ""This was a difficult and challenging night for the City of Des Moines. What began as a peaceful rally for many escalated into needless violence on our streets. Fortunately, no one suffered serious injuries, however, as we’ve seen in the light of day there was damage to nearby businesses, cars, and property."" — This is a developing story.

""It was not enough,"" Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — ""an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,"" according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. ""We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,"" the governor said Saturday. ""But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life."" The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd's death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order ""to help keep peace in Louisville."" ""I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,"" Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. ""But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe."" President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd's memory is for authorities to ""get tougher"" on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called ""radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can't do this."" ""They've got to be tough, they've got to be smart,"" Trump said of state officials. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military."" In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump's comments, saying that though the outrage is ""real and legitimate,"" the protests are ""being hijacked by violent radical elements."" ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,"" Barr said. ""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.""

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) during a campaign event on March 2, 2020 in Dallas, Texas. Klobuchar has suspended her campaign and endorsed Biden before the upcoming Super Tuesday Democratic presidential primaries. (Photo by Ron Jenkins/Getty Images) Advertisement Biden ally sees Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate Share Shares Copy Link Copy Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said Friday. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters that while he believes Klobuchar is “absolutely” qualified to be vice president, “This is very tough timing for her.” Klobuchar, D-Minn., was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. As she was leaving the post to join the Senate, an officer involved in this week’s death of George Floyd was involved in the death of another man. The officer ultimately was not prosecuted. Clyburn, who said his view was his “gut feeling,” played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the party’s all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress’ highest-ranking black lawmaker.Related: NY protesters demand justice for George Floyd“So often in politics, timing really dictates things, Barack Obama I don’t think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. “And I don’t know whether he could get elected today.”On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota have “nothing to do with my running mate.” Pressed on whether Floyd’s killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. “And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Clyburn helped revive Biden’s badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive triumph in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party’s presumptive nominee. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, was prosecutor of Minnesota's largest county, which includes Minneapolis. While Klobuchar was in that job, more than two dozen citizens died during encounters with police but none of the officers involved were criminally charged. Most victims were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of the past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breath as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. The case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar had been elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney’s office. Klobuchar did not respond to a request by The Associated Press for an interview on Friday. But she told NBC news that reports stating she had declined the case involving Chauvin years ago were “absolutely false.”Klobuchar told the network that during the years she led the office, it was the practice to present police shooting cases to a grand jury to consider charges. She said she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote a letter Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate “patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing” by the Minneapolis police. ___AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

For several journalists across the country, the demonstrations were taking an ominous, dangerous turn. A reporter for Gray Television-owned WIS-TV in Columbia, South Carolina, was hit in the head by a thrown rock on Saturday. She later tweeted about the experience. Miranda Parnell says a person wearing a MAGA hat showed up at the rally, protesters confronted that person. Rocks were then thrown and one of them hit Parnell. Parnell. was taken from the scene to an area hospital and is okay. Earlier, a journalist in Minneapolis was shot in the thigh by a rubber bullet. Demonstrators also broke windows and vandalized the Atlanta office building where CNN is headquartered, and police in Louisville, Kentucky, apologized after an officer fired what appeared to be pepper bullets at a television news crew with WAVE, also owned by Gray Television. Fox's Leland Vittert was rattled following the Washington attack that he said was clearly targeted at his news organization. “We took a good thumping,” he told The Associated Press. A live shot he was doing was interrupted by a group of protesters who shouted obscenities directed at Fox. Flanked by two security guards, he and photographer Christian Galdabini walked away from Washington's Lafayette Park trailed by an angry group before riot police dispersed them. Vittert said there were no markings on him or the crew's equipment to identify them as from Fox. But he said during the demonstration, one man continually asked him who he worked for. He didn't answer, but the man found a picture of Vittert on his cell phone and shouted to other protesters that he was from Fox. “The protesters stopped protesting whatever it was they were protesting and turned on us,” he said, “and that was a very different feeling.” He compared it to when he was chased away from a demonstration in Egypt during the Arab Spring of 2011 by a group that shouted, “Fox News hates Muslims.” A correspondent from the website The Daily Caller followed Vittert and the demonstrators as they left the park. At one point, someone took Vittert's microphone and threw it at his back. One woman chasing him wore a t-shirt that said, “I can’t breathe,” a reference what Floyd said earlier this week when a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck. Vittert said he was “extremely grateful” to the Daily Caller for documenting the scene; Galdabini’s camera was smashed. “They were putting themselves at risk,” he said. “It makes me proud to do my job and to be a journalist,” he said. “I'm proud to be an organization that is unyielding in our coverage. We're going to keep on telling our story and doing exactly what we're doing.” Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media, said in a memo on Saturday that Fox was taking all necessary security precautions to protect its journalists covering the story. “We are truly living in unprecedented and transformative times and freedom of the press is a vital element to the foundation of our society,” Scott wrote. On Friday, CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his two-person crew were arrested while covering overnight protests in Minneapolis. They were quickly released, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized to CNN. CNN's headquarters in Atlanta was targeted later Friday by a group of protesters who also fought with police and set cars afire. While police tried to keep them away from the CNN Center, demonstrators broke windows there and scrawled obscene graffiti on the network's logo. In Louisville, WAVE-TV was on the air covering a demonstration when video showed a police officer aiming a rifle at reporter Kaitlin Rust and her crew. She was heard yelling, “I’ve been shot! I’ve been shot!” and described them as pepper bullets. Louisville Police spokeswoman Jesse Halladay apologized for the incident, and said police would review the video for potential discipline. Demonstrators surrounded the police department headquarters in Columbia, S.C. on Saturday and a scuffle broke out with someone wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat. Rocks were thrown and Miranda Parnell, a television reporters from WIS-TV, was injured and taken to the hospital, according to a tweet from network anchor Judi Gatson. It was not clear who threw the rock that hit Parnell. In Minneapolis on Saturday, a Swedish journalist was shot in the thigh with a rubber bullet, apparently from a police gun, while covering a protest, according to the Norwegian newspaper VG. ___ AP correspondents Mike Stewart in Atlanta, Jari Tanner in Minneapolis and Bruce Schreiner and Dylan Lovan in Louisville, and Jeffrey S.

1621166934,2020-05-30 18:00:32,George Floyd protest in Omaha: Crowds gathering again at 72nd & Dodge as police staging nearby,https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/George-Floyd-protest-in-Omaha-at-72nd-and-Dodge-on-Saturday-May-30-570895831.html,en,False,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"What began Saturday afternoon as groups chanting and waving signs at traffic along the intersection of 72nd and Dodge streets turned violent around 9:30 p.m. as protestors moved downtown, escalating to vandalism — from spray painting buildings to breaking windows with rocks and traffic signs. WARNING: Some video clips in this coverage, taken from livestream coverage, contains explicit language. A civilian was shot at 12th and Harney downtown, according to a tweet from Omaha Police. A suspect was taken into custody. At 9 p.m. Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer spoke with media about the protest. He said it began peacefully, but early on there were protesters who sought to agitate the situation and threw rocks at officers. A number of people were arrested Saturday, he said. As the night continued, more members of law enforcement were the target of bottles, rocks, a squirt gun filled with urine and there were reports of individuals with firearms at the protest, he said. Schmaderer said concern for the safety of protestors and law enforcement resulted in the gathering being declared an unlawful assembly. Police began to move the crowd away from the intersection. More objects were thrown at officers, he said, and tear gas was deployed along with pepper balls. ""I want to thank the peaceful protestors who came to exercise their voice on this important matter; but unfortunately some agitated the matter,"" he said. No rubber bullets were fired. Schmaderer said the Omaha Police Department does not have rubber bullets in their arsenal. ""Our desire was to be here for everyone's safety and to express themselves. Once it becomes apparent, when things get unlawful and dangerous, that's when the totality of circumstances made for the unlawful assembly,"" he said. Preston Love, founder of Black Votes Matter Institute of Community Engagement and professor of black studies at UNO, issued a statement overnight calling for the end to the melee: ""George Floyd's death creates the message. That message is the demand to stop the assassination of blacks by police or sick racist. For that we protest. If you are breaking the law, destroying property and now violent, you are counter-productive to our message and disrespecting Mr. Floyd and his family. As a black community leader I appeal to you stop, work for our struggle not against it."" With chants like ""No justice; no peace,"" ""George Floyd,"" ""I can't breathe,"" and ""Hands up; don't shoot,"" protestors initially gathered to protest at the intersection of 72nd & Dodge around Saturday afternoon into the evening. At about 8:20 p.m., OPD deployed crowd-control measures including flashbangs, tear gas, and pepper bullets at protestors in the Target parking lot. Our 6 News crew was hit with tear gas and ricochet from pepper balls. One reporter was hit in her eye, the other on her legs. At 8:47 p.m., Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert issued a statement on the protests, ahead of a planned update from OPD: For two nights now, protestors have misused their right to lawfully assemble, risking the safety of other citizens and police officers. It is time to stop inciting violence. The Omaha Police Department is taking the necessary steps to protect everyone involved. I support the actions of Chief Schmaderer. Those who break the law will be arrested and held accountable. Tear gas had been used on another group of protestors a few minutes earlier after they threw water bottles at officers. About 5:40 p.m., officers were seen making arrests in the street. [WATCH] Both days of protests here have remained mostly peaceful. Some property damage occurred late Friday night; arrests have occurred both days. In one notable moment Saturday evening, a protestor and an officer exchanged a peaceful gesture after a short conversation. A few hours before Saturday's protests began, local officials called for any further protests to remain peaceful. Before the crowd started to gather Saturday afternoon, workers were seen at the Target store at 72nd and Dodge streets boarding up windows broken out during last night's protest as a small crowd began to gather along the sidewalks at the intersection just after 4 p.m. [WATCH] Across the parking lot a few minutes later, a small crowd began lining the sidewalks along the corner, carrying signs, holding banners, and waving American flags. Outside the store, Omaha Police were gathered, some in protective gear. Around 4:15 p.m., Nebraska State Patrol troopers were there, too, putting on similar equipment. By 4:45 p.m., a much larger crowd had started to gather, and cars driving through and past the intersection were honking at protestors, who cheered in response. Barriers were already in place along Dodge Street extending east and west of 72nd Street. Police were seen going hands-on with some protestors at 5:30 p.m. Several protestors were seen being handcuffed and loaded into police vehicles afterward. Members of law enforcement could be seen on the roof of DoSpace with binoculars and what looked like rifles. More police in protective gear entered the intersection. There were more arrests as the protest continued. Protestors could be seen leaving the intersection and walking to the parking lot of Target nearby. A police ATV was also at the scene, drawing the attention of protestors in the parking lot. — FOLLOW: 6 News live tweets",0.0

Advertisement ""In solidarity w/ our brothers & sisters in Minneapolis, KYRC + @kaepernick7 established our Legal Defense Initiative to support Freedom Fighters on the ground,"" the nonprofit wrote on Twitter. Kaepernick also promoted the fund on Instagram, writing that we must protect our ""Freedom Fighters."" ""In fighting for liberation there's always retaliation,"" he said. The initiative would provide those in need with ""top defense lawyers"" in the Minneapolis area, the website states. Video: Minneapolis police chief speaks out about destructive protests Kaepernick has been involved in protests against systemic racial injustice for years, most famously when — to protest police brutality — he would kneel before NFL games while the national anthem would play. The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback was among sporting figures who paid tribute to George Floyd and spoke out against his death. However, Kaepernick has been without a football team since 2017, when he became a free agent. No team has offered him a contract, which many have argued is due to his protests. Kaepernick filed a grievance against the NFL accusing team owners of colluding to keep him from being signed. The NFL denied any collusion and in 2019, they reached a settlement with Kaepernick and former teammate Eric Reid, who knelt with him.",0.0

A boom that sent the crowd fleeing as tear gas started to fill the air. As smoke completely enveloped the northwest corner of Dodge and 72nd streets in front of the Crossroads Target, a huddled group of people under the Crossroads Mall sign pointed toward the center of the white cloud flashing red and blue against police sirens. One girl, barely old enough to be in high school it seemed, held her ground. As the smoke rescinded, the crowd rushed back, dumping water over her eyes and face as she stood motionless, gripping a cardboard sign the size of a car door window that simply said, “George Floyd.” Police and protesters clashed Friday night across the nation, including Omaha, at demonstrations in response the death of George Floyd, a 47-year-old black man in Minneapolis who died after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck. Protesters began gathering at the intersection of Dodge and 72nd streets in the early evening and disbursed in the early hours of Saturday morning. Advertisement I didn’t go to this protest to talk to people, take notes and do many other things I’m accustomed to doing as a reporter. I went to observe, stand with the crowd, listen and experience what felt like a catalytic event in history—a nationwide moment of intensity analogous to few others, able to draw at least 1,000 people, though even city officials were unsure if it could be more, in Omaha out of their homes in the middle of an unprecedented health crisis. I arrived around 9 p.m. Police had already fired tear gas into the crowd around before the sun had set. By the time I arrived, protesters had left the sidewalks and flooded the intersections. It wasn’t long before police in riot gear started marching eastward across the intersection to back the crowd up. After they’d gone maybe 1,000 feet, the march slowed as protesters held their ground. Eventually the sound of stun grenades and sight of tear gas started to fill the lamplit sidewalks and streets. Police used tear gas several times on the crowd near the intersection —the justification being to clear people from the streets onto the sidewalks, although police had blocked off 72nd Street going north and south and had cruisers blocking traffic on Dodge Street probably a mile in either direction. I don’t know if there was any violence toward police officers. I can only say I didn’t see any firsthand. Protesters yelled and got confrontational. Plastic water bottles sailed from the back of the crowd and sometimes exploded at the boots of officers and at least a few times glanced off an officers riot helmet. Some people threw rocks. At least once I saw someone throw a glass bottle. Advertisement I saw one person on the southeast intersection carried away by police. At a 1 p.m. press conference, Omaha Police Department Chief Todd Schmaderer said officers made 21 arrests. Of those, 16 of the arrested individuals were white, three were black and two were Hispanic. People were arrested on charges varying from disorderly conduct to unlawful possession of a firearm. Schmaderer also said 12 businesses were damaged, each estimated” at thousands of dollars. He said two officers suffered minor injuries and police recorded one minor civilian injury. Twelve police cruisers between several area agencies that responded to the event, were damaged as well. No arrests were due to assaults on an officer, Schmaderer said. Schmaderer also said he was not disappointed in the community and understood their reaction. “We have to acknowledge the anger and we do,” he said. “We have to acknowledge what our uniform means to many people at this moment, and we do.” But with more protests on the way tonight, Schmaderer and Mayor Jean Stothert said police will be there and use similar tactics if it turns violent as it did last night, they said. The most palpable feelings Friday night were grief, frustration and anger. That manifested in people’s protests in a variety of ways. Some begged the bottle and rock throwers to stop. There were plenty of arguments between protesters over the messages on their signs and the reason everyone gathered. After an ebb and flow of people in the streets as police fired tear gas toward a crowd of mostly young high school and college-aged kids, part of the group ran to Target. The group, which seemed to be led by a young white man, got to the front of the department store where police were already lined up in riot gear. More police came as the two sides stared each other down. Eventually something whipped through a corner window and shattered it. Police started shooting tear gas and plastic pepper bullets filled with a chalky white powder. The crowd reeled, regrouped and moved west across the parking lots toward Best Buy where, again, they were met by police. Finally they ended the small migration at a Bucky’s gas station where it appeared a few people looted beer and snacks. Along the way the window of a Verizon store was shattered, some damage had been done to a Burger King drive-thru sign and countless graffiti tags were scribbled on walls, the pavement and even a KMTV news van. But in all it was much less than what other cities have experienced. Some of the crowd, now decentralized and lingering across more than a mile of Dodge Street, started to head back toward the center. Police had now backed up most protesters to the southeast corner of Target’s parking lot and the sidewalk down below. At least one person attempted to set a dumpster in the corner of the Target parking lot on fire before another crowd member snuffed it out with a gallon of water he poured over the trash. Eventually police began marching across the parking lot, firing even more tear gas and forcing many onto the sidewalks along the northwest corner of Dodge and 72nd streets where more police holding batons lined the curb. By midnight, with hardly anywhere left to go, most of the crowd had left. As I walked back to my car, the surreality and grief of the situation settled. Many of the protestors were kids, angry and upset by a country that seems to continually fail them. From Floyd to the coronavirus pandemic which has killed and infected people of color at rates multitudes higher than their share of the population, it’s difficult to capture the mosaic of emotion that formed into that protest. At times it felt like I was outside my body, watching a different reality than my own play out. The things that brought me back were the girl standing in tear gas. I only caught a slight downwind spray and I was bleary eyed. It, along with getting shot with plastic pepper bullets, is not fun, glamorous or heroic in the slightest. At one point a semi-truck blocked in traffic by protesters finally inched through the intersection after police gassed and shot protesters back. The white truck paused in the intersection as a fist emerged from the passenger window and the driver laid on the horn. The crowd cheered and clapped. When I got back to my home in South Omaha, my roommates, who had also attended the protest, and I sat in silence. At 1:30 a.m. we turned on the television to watch a press conference from Minnesota. Gov. Tim Walz said the protests, once a peaceful expression of pain and grief, were now fueled by chaos. He’s probably right. But these are times without precedent and the language of political expression many used in the past seems out of place now. Walz also said the state is mobilizing a police force larger than any used there during the civil rights era. I don’t know what that means for the coming days, weeks and months. The country is still in the midst of a global pandemic and locally Douglas County just saw its largest single-day increase in cases on Thursday. Millions are out of work in levels unseen since the Great Depression and many have struggled to get unemployment benefits and stay afloat. Last night may have been about one man in Minnesota, but it turned up the intensity another couple notches on frustrations over racial and class inequality—feelings that have bubbled for years and seem to have finally exploded across the nation in a way that’s decentralized and hard to imagine.",0.0

In Minneapolis, authorities reported a ratcheting down of the previous night's unrest after an influx of National Guard troops and state troopers were dispatched to the city. ""Clearly we did not have the numbers in [Minneapolis police] alone,"" the city's mayor, Jacob Frey told Minnesota Public Radio early Sunday. ""Additional force was necessary."" Law enforcement began to make arrests in Minneapolis after an 8 p.m. curfew as crowds gathered at the 5th Precinct police building. Paul Schnell, the state corrections commissioner, said at a Saturday night press conference that an official count of arrests was not yet available but that authorities were ""committed to do whatever it takes to bring order."" Former Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden released a statement early Sunday morning condemning the violence and urging Americans to ""take care of each other."" ""Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response,"" he wrote. ""But burning down communities and needless destruction is not."" We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 31, 2020 Biden added, ""the act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest."" 1 person fatally shot in Indianapolis At least one person has died after being shot in downtown Indianapolis Saturday night. Police Chief Randal Taylor said at a press conference that authorities were still investigating the incident's connection to ongoing demonstrations in the city. ""Downtown is not safe at this time,"" Taylor said. He urged residents who do not live in the area to leave. Mayor Joe Hogsett called the day's protests ""successful"" in a tweet, but condemned the ""small group of people"" that grew violent later in the night. This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard.  Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop. — Mayor Joe Hogsett (@IndyMayorJoe) May 31, 2020 Police cruisers seen going through crowds in New York Several videos of protests in New York showed a police patrol vehicle driving through crowds of protesters. Protesters are seen surrounding and throwing debris at a car while another one drove into them. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the footage ""upsetting"" at a late night press conference Saturday but said it was ""inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers."" He addressed the city's peaceful protesters, saying they were heard but urging them to go home. ""We hear your desire to see these issues: relationship between police and community, the need for justice, the need for real change in our society,"" he said. ""We appreciate and respect all peaceful protests, but it is now time for people to go home."" California governor declares state of emergency in LA County Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti requested assistance to restore order Saturday night amid protests. A curfew began at 8 p.m. PT and is expected to end at 5:30 a.m. local time. The LAPD said hundreds of protesters were arrested amid the protests. An unlawful assembly was declared in the the Mid-Wilshire area and businesses were asked to close. Protesters blocked the 110 freeway in downtown LA and videos taken at protests showed looting and broken windows at stores in The Grove mall. Garcetti urged protesters to ""take a breath"" and ""step away"" at a press conference. He asked residents to go home and protest peacefully at a later time. We will always protect free speech and Angelenos’ right to live without fear of violence or vandalism. To increase safety for demonstrators, law enforcement and all citizens of Los Angeles, we are putting a curfew in place from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. https://t.co/vy3XM760qb — MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) May 30, 2020 Gov.

Demonstrators flocked to the White House and nearby Lafayette Square throughout the afternoon where city and U.S. Park police and the Secret Service maintained barricades and pushed back against protesters, at times using pepper spray in an attempt to disperse crowds. Fireworks were set off and at least one car was set on fire. Buildings in downtown Washington had windows smashed — including the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute and an Apple store. A liquor store and a T-Mobile were also looted as tensions remained high through the early morning. The D.C. police union tweeted that one of its members had been hospitalized after being hit by a rock. We can confirm that at least one member has been hospitalized after being struck with a rock. — DC Police Union (@DCPoliceUnion) May 31, 2020 Earlier on Saturday, President Trump falsely accused the city's mayor, Muriel Bowser, of refusing to let D.C. police assist in containing Friday night's demonstrations. Bowser fired back at Trump at a Saturday press conference, saying the president's warning that ""ominous weapons"" and ""vicious dogs"" awaited any protester who made it past the White House fence was ""no subtle reminder"" of the country's history of segregationist violence. On Sunday morning, Bowser reiterated that sentiment on NBC's Meet The Press. ""I think the president has a responsibility to help calm the nation and he can start by not sending divisive tweets that are meant to harken to the segregationist past of our country and he can start by doing that right now,"" Bowser said. This is a developing story. Some things reported by the media will turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops. ",0.0

For the most part, the protest was peaceful as police attempted to keep their distance, even as protesters numbering in the hundreds moved across the city on heavily traveled O Street. Any sense of peaceful protest changed, however, as protesters and law enforcement clashed on the steps of the County-City Building in the 11 o'clock hour. Hours earlier, Police Chief Jeff Bliemeister spoke to the group that first gathered at the Capitol on Saturday afternoon, again condemning the actions of police in Minneapolis that led to George Floyd's death earlier this week and sparked protests across the country.

Protesters demonstrate against the death of George Floyd, a black man who was in police custody in Minneapolis, Friday, May 29, 2020, in New York. (Source: AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) “This can be kind of a tinderbox for COVID,"" the 39-year-old venture capitalist said after attending a demonstration in Florida, one of many around the country sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. As more beaches, churches, mosques, schools and businesses reopened worldwide, the sudden and mass civil unrest in the United States is raising fears of new virus outbreaks in a country that has more confirmed infections and deaths than any other. And it’s not just in the U.S. — London hosted a large anti-racism protest Sunday where demonstrators violated social distancing rules. Rosa Jimenez Cano said she planned to self-quarantine for 14 days, worrying she was perhaps “irresponsible” when she attended Saturday night's protest in Miami, where she exposed herself to crowds of people. Protests over Floyd's death — the latest in a series of killings of black men and women at the hands of police in America — have shaken the country from Minneapolis to New York, from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Some turned into riots and clashes with police, leaving stores in flames and torched cars in the streets. Health experts fear that silent carriers of the virus could unwittingly infect others at protests where people are packed cheek to jowl, many without masks, many chanting, singing or shouting. The virus is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, sing or talk. “There’s no question that, when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets ... it’s not healthy,"" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” ""Two weeks from now across America, we’re going to find out whether or not this gives us a spike and drives the numbers back up again or not.” The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was very concerned that the protests in the nation’s capital and elsewhere could provide fertile ground for a new series of outbreaks. Many of the protesters were wearing masks, but there were no attempts at social distancing. “We’ve been working very hard in these last eight to 10 weeks to not have any mass gatherings,” she said. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound.” Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it. Mass protests in connection with Floyd’s death were also being held in Europe. In London, thousands of people marched Sunday chanting “No justice! No peace!” while carrying signs reading “Justice for George Floyd” and “Racism is a global issue.” Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together. Britain has seen nearly 38,500 virus deaths, the second-highest in the world after the United States. In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections. Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested. The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed. In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam’s holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, authorities were locking down an area of nearly 1.5 million people as cases continued to rise. Mayor Claudia Lopez said no one in the working-class Kennedy area — inaugurated by the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1961 — will be allowed out, except to seek food or medical care or in case of an emergency. Factories must also close. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Sunday that he would ask Parliament for a final two-week extension of the nation’s state of emergency that is set to expire on June 7. That allows the government to keep ordering lockdown measures to control its coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 27,000 lives, many of them in overwhelmed nursing homes. “We have almost reached safe harbor,” Sánchez said. At the Vatican, Pope Francis cautioned people against being pessimistic as they emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. During Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica to mark Pentecost Sunday, Francis noted a tendency to say that “nothing will return as before.” That kind of thinking, Francis said, guarantees that “the one thing that certainly does not return is hope.” ___ Kirka reported from London and Gorondi reported from Budapest.

HE IS CONCERNED AND WARNS THAT IF WE DO NOT RELAX OUR EFFORTS -- WE CANNOT RELAX OUR EFFORTS TO STOP THE VIRUS, EVEN AS THE PROTESTS GO ON. >> WE ALL LIVED THROUGH THE SHUTDOWN OF MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, AND I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO RELIVE SHUTTING DOWN BUSINESSES AGAIN. ALEX: LOCAL OFFICIALS SAY THAT THEY ENCOURAGE PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATIONS, THEY ALSO WARNED THAT THE PROTESTS COULD INCREASE THE SPREAD OF CORONAVIRUS. IN THE MIDST OF SUCH LARGE GATHERINGS, AND ASYMPTOMATIC DEMONSTRATOR COULD UNDO THE GOOD THAT HAS BEEN IN COMPILATION IN ATTEMPTING TO SLOW THE SPREAD. OFFICIALS ARE NOT ASKING PEOPLE TO STOP PROTESTING, THEY ARE SAYING TO DO IT SAFELY. THEY SAY THAT SOCIAL DISTANCING MUST STILL BE PRACTICED, STAYING SIX FEET APART AND FACE COVERINGS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT. THE MAYOR SAYS THE CURRENT CURFEW THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE AFTER THE DEMONSTRATIONS OVER THE WEEKEND IS NOT TO STIFLE PROTESTS Advertisement National coronavirus updates: Some US states are seeing increases in coronavirus cases Share Shares Copy Link Copy The latest:There have been more than 1.9 million coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The U.S. death toll has surpassed 110,000 people, according to Hopkins.The longest economic expansion in American history is officially over. The National Bureau of Economic Research declared Monday that the recession began in February.The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month.New World Health Organization guidance recommends that fabric masks — which can be homemade — be at least three layers.While states lift more restrictions and more Americans go out to socialize or protest, almost half of U.S states are seeing higher rates of new coronavirus cases.But the situation would have been much worse had states not shut down, a new study says.More than 1.9 million Americans have been infected, and more than 110,000 have died in just over four months, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Nationwide, 22 states are seeing upward trends in coronavirus cases. About 20 states have seen decreases in recent days, and eight states are holding steady. One of the states with the biggest spikes in new cases is Florida. The number of new cases reported each day has increased an average of roughly 46% over the past week, just as most of the state entered a second phase of reopening.While big cities on the coasts were hit hard early in the pandemic, the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Utah, state Rep. Suzanne Harrison called a recent spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend.Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.Health officials raise concerns of virus spreading among protestsHealth officials have raised concern about coronavirus spread as thousands of people are now braving a pandemic to participate in the national protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday it was closely monitoring the demonstrations taking place across the U.S. and warned such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases.For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said without the lockdowns that most states put in place, that death toll could have been significantly higher.As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out and always maintain a distance.But the large protests make it hard to keep the recommended social distancing guidelines and ""may put others at risk,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.""It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal COVID-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground,"" she said.Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus.""I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,"" he said — especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.So far, more than 1,942,000 people have been infected in the U.S., and at least 110,514 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some states see rise in new casesWhile the early parts of the outbreak in the country hit dense metropolitan areas on the coast the hardest — including California and New York — the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Harris County, Texas, health officials said they identified a nursing home with both cases of the virus and deaths.On Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health said on Twitter. Utah State Rep. Suzanne Harrison called the spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend. ""Please be careful. Practice social distancing. Avoid crowds. Use masks where appropriate. Wash your hands.""Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs — including Arkansas State, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.An important drug could run out Meanwhile, as officials emphasize the U.S. is not yet out of the woods, a government official gave a stark warning. The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir last month. The drug, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola, is now used on hospitalized Covid patients. A study has shown it helps cut down the length of hospital stays.The government has been working to help Gilead ""with some of their supply chain challenges in terms of raw materials and being able to accelerate the process,"" Kadlec said.""Whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,"" he said.",0.0
1621466849,2020-05-31 07:12:00,GRAPHIC: Anger over police killings shatters US,https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/Were-sick-of-it-Anger-over-police-killings-shatters-US-570903111.html,en,True,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets across America again Sunday, with peaceful demonstrations against police killings of black people overshadowed by unrest that ravaged cities from Philadelphia to Los Angeles and flared near the White House. Police move towards a protester after curfew Saturday, May 30, 2020, in Minneapolis. Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (Source: AP Photo/John Minchillo) City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters' movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry — boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for ""overwhelming force"" against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. ""Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,"" said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. ""Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning."" Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. ""They keep killing our people,"" said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. ""I'm so sick and tired of it."" But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it ""really shocking to watch."" In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. ""We're not done,"" said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests."" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and Sunday. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at ""far left extremist"" groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a ""sacred space."" Among in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. ""I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,"" he said. ___ Morrison and Sullivan reported from Minneapolis.

Water bottles and fireworks were thrown at officers, leading police to use tear gas to disperse the crowd. The standoff between officers and protesters continued through the midnight hour, with police firing teargas and protesters shooting fireworks back at them. Numerous nearby buildings were vandalized with rioters spraying graffiti and breaking windows. There were reports of multiple buildings being broken into, and around 3am there was a report of a fully-involved fire on the first story of the building at 601 S 12th Street. In the early morning hours, some individuals targeted a 1011 NOW crew who was filming the vandalism, shoving our reporter who was operating the camera. A photographer at another local station was also struck. Neither was seriously injured. Earlier, another large gathering took place at Centennial Mall and O Street which moved to the Nebraska State Capitol building, but this one remained peaceful. A number of peaceful protesters told 1011 NOW many who were committing violence were not a part of the original protest, and were harming their cause. The downtown protests come after a group damaged and looted a gas station and another business early Saturday morning. Lincoln Police said multiple officers were injured and multiple arrests were made. This is a developing situation and more information will be released when it becomes available. ",0.0

The president has said that members of the loosely defined far-left group Antifa — short for ""anti-fascists"" — have led clashes with police and looting in cities across the U.S. since the killing of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis. It's unclear if any group or groups are primarily responsible for escalating protests that began following George Floyd's death on May 25 as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has told the press that he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence. In one tweet on Sunday, Trump said the U.S. ""will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" It's something he has previously floated, and last year two Republican senators introduced a resolution that sought to designate the group as a domestic terrorist organization. Following Trump's tweet, Attorney General William Barr said in a statement that ""[f]ederal law enforcement actions will be directed at apprehending and charging the violent radical agitators who have hijacked peaceful protest."" Barr added: ""The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly."" The clashes, spreading to dozens of cities across the U.S., follow a series of racist incidents and deaths of black people, including Floyd's on Monday. Chauvin, now a former Minneapolis police officer, was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck while holding him in custody as Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers present at the scene have been fired but not arrested or charged. Protests and clashes that have since followed come at a time of unprecedented crisis for the country, with confirmed deaths from the coronavirus pandemic topping 100,000 and millions of people out of work as a result of broad business shutdowns. Minorities, including African Americans, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 deaths and pandemic-induced economic peril.

It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger, and grief."" pic.twitter.com/lirAMSv4Wo — The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 30, 2020 Trump addressed the demonstrations Saturday, striking a milder tone than he has on Twitter during prepared remarks following a space launch in Florida. He said Floyd's death ""has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger and grief."" He added that he ""understands the pain that people are feeling"" and supports peaceful protest, but that ""the memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists."" ""He should just sometimes stop talking"" Apart from Saturday's remarks, though, Trump has not often played a unifying role in recent days. His tweets about radical-left anarchists have also included criticism of Democratic leadership in Minnesota. In another tweet on Sunday, he blamed the mainstream media for fomenting ""hatred and anarchy."" Time for a change! #2020 https://t.co/AECy2GBfys — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020 On Friday, Trump tweeted provocatively that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase with a racist history that Trump said he was not aware of. Later on, he said his intent was not to make a threat but to register a statement of concern that armed violence can accompany looting. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, said on Fox News Sunday that the president's tweets about demonstrations turning violent are ""not constructive."" Speaking on ABC's This Week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Sunday morning that she's not paying attention to Trump's inflammatory tweets. Instead, she said he ""should be a unifying force in our country. We have seen that with Democratic and Republican presidents all along. They have seen their responsibility to be the president of the United States, to unify our country and not to fuel the flame."" Also Sunday, Keisha Lance Bottoms — mayor of Atlanta, one city that has seen protests and clashes with police — told CBS' Face the Nation that Trump's tweets are ""making it worse"" and ""he should just sometimes stop talking."" In his own statement on Saturday, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, wrote that ""Protesting [Floyd's killing] is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not."" He added that as president, he'd lead the conversation about turning the nation's ""anguish to purpose."" ",0.0

President Donald Trump listens during a meeting about the coronavirus response with Gov. Phil Murphy, D-N.J., in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, April 30, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Antifa, short for anti-fascists, is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. “The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,” Trump tweeted around noon on Sunday. As protests over the death of George Floyd grow in cities across the U.S., government officials have been warning of the “outsiders” -- groups of organized rioters they say are flooding into major cities not to call for justice but to cause destruction. But the state and federal officials have offered differing assessments of who the outsiders are. They’ve blamed left-wing extremists, far-right white nationalists and even suggested the involvement of drug cartels. These leaders have offered little evidence to back up those claims, and the chaos of the protests makes verifying identities and motives exceedingly difficult. The finger pointing on both sides of the political spectrum is likely to deepen the political divide in the U.S., allowing politicians to advance the theory that aligns with their political view and distract from the underlying frustrations that triggered the protests. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday told reporters he’d heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence and that even drug cartels “are trying to take advantage of the chaos.” John Harrington, the state’s commissioner of public safety, later said they had received intel reports on white supremacists. “But I cannot say that we have confirmed observations of local law enforcement to say that we’ve seen cells of white supremacists in the area,” he said Saturday. But federal officials later pointed to “far left extremist groups."" President Donald Trump alleged the violence was “being led by Antifa and other radical groups.” Attorney General William Barr later seemed to echo Trump's assertion, saying the violent incidents in Minneapolis were driven by groups using ""Antifa-like tactics."" Barr vowed that federal prosecutors across the country would use federal riots statutes to charge protesters who cross state lines to participate in violent rioting. A Justice Department spokesperson said the attorney general’s assertion was based on information provided from state and local law enforcement agencies, but did not detail what that information entailed. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was even more vague, declining to point to any particular ideology in his assessment. His agency has heard that “a number of different groups are involved in these whether it’s Antifa or it’s others, frankly,"" he said. The groups appeared to be organized and using tactics that wouldn’t normally happen in peaceful protest, he said, though he didn’t elaborate. While the motives behind the violence were unclear, there was firmer evidence that some of the protesters were coming to the demonstrations from outside the urban centers that have been the epicenter of the demonstrations. In New York City, federal officials were bringing charges against several suspects, including one of two sisters from upstate New York accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail through the back window of a police van in Brooklyn, a law enforcement official said. The initially peaceful demonstrations in New York City over Floyd’s death spiraled into chaos as night fell Friday. Protesters confronted police officers, destroying police vehicles and setting fires. In Detroit, 37 of the 60 people who were arrested in overnight protests did not live in the city — and many came from nearby suburbs, police Chief James Craig said Saturday. Although Detroit is about 80% black, many of those arrested were white. “We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,” Craig told reporters. “If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community.” Initially, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said he’d been told all of those arrested in his city Friday were from outside the state. But a spokesman said Saturday night the mayor had later learned more than half are from Minnesota. In Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, 47 of the 57 people arrested in protest incidents through Saturday morning had provided a Minnesota address to authorities, according to Jeremy Zoss, a spokesman for the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office. Carter expressed the opinion of many black activists in the Twin Cities who have expressed disbelief that local residents would destroy their own neighborhoods, burning down essential services and damaging small businesses. And while it was local protesters and groups that staged initial angry, but peaceful, demonstrations, it was agitators from elsewhere that strategically escalated the tension by causing damage and setting fires, they said. Their beliefs were reinforced by the large numbers of white people in the protests in Minneapolis. “I think about a third of the people are from out of town here to make the city burn,” said Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage. “It is just putting black people in a crossfire not just between fascists and anarchists -- but putting us in a crossfire with the national guard.” It’s exceedingly difficult in the chaos and dark of the events to prove these claims. The challenge is made harder in the Minnesota protest, where very few arrests were made in the first two nights of unrest. St. Paul arrest records showed 18 people were arrested on charges related to civil unrest from Thursday to early Saturday morning. Of those, only four were from outside the state; two were listed as unknown. Still, some civil rights leaders had a clear message for anyone coming to protest, even those who show up to call for justice for Floyd. “The moment has passed. Go home, stay away from here. We are a vulnerable population. At the end of that day if black folks can’t rebuild then the only thing we’ve done is build more power for white folks,"" said Terrell. ""You’re talking about years, decades of work undone by these groups -- and by the officer.” Trump vowed Saturday that the “radical left criminals, thugs and others” would “not be allowed to set communities ablaze.” “I will not allow angry mobs to dominate,” he said. “Won’t happen.” Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

People, some of them kneeling gather in Trafalgar Square in central London on Sunday, May 31, 2020 to protest against the recent killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis that has led to protests across the US. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham) Racism-tinged events no longer startle even America's closest allies, though many have watched coverage of the often-violent protests with growing unease. Burning cars and riot police in the U.S. featured on newspaper front pages around the globe Sunday — bumping news of the COVID-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places. Floyd's death on May 25 in Minneapolis was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in the U.S. Thousands gathered in central London on Sunday to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting ""No justice! No peace!"" and waving placards with the words ""How many more?"" at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn't stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred milled around in the street and waved placards. Protesters in Denmark also converged on the U.S. Embassy on Sunday. Participants carried placards with messages such as ""Stop Killing Black People."" The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday under the motto: ""Justice for George Floyd."" Several hundred more people took to the streets Sunday in the capital's Kreuzberg area, carrying signs with slogans like ""Silence is Violence,"" ""Hold Cops Accountable,"" and ""Who Do You Call When Police Murder?"" No incidents were reported. Germany's top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline ""This killer-cop set America ablaze"" with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd's death, with his knee on Floyd's neck. The newspaper's story reported ""scenes like out of a civil war."" In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper's senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd's killing was ""different"" than previous cases of black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence. ""There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,"" Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor's warning that ""anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.'' In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials' criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China's crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: ""I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?"" Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America's racial unrest by tweeting ""I can't breathe,"" which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed ""a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters."" Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of ""setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,"" without offering any evidence. Russia accused the United States of ""systemic problems in the human rights sphere.'' It denounced Floyd's death as the latest in a series of police violence cases against African Americans. ""This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,'' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ""American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.'' There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. In Brazil, hundreds of people gathered in front of the Rio de Janeiro state government palace to protest crimes committed by the police against black people in Rio's working-class neighborhoods, known as favelas. The protest, called ""Black lives matter,"" was interrupted when police used tear gas to disperse people. ""I can't breathe"", said some of the demonstrators, alluding to the George Floyd´s death. Protesters called for an end to police operations inside favelas. In Canada, an anti-racism protest degenerated into clashes between Montreal police and some demonstrators. About three hours after a march that snaked its way through downtown Montreal had ended, police declared the gathering illegal after they say projectiles were thrown at officers who responded with pepper spray and tear gas. Some windows were smashed and some fires were set. Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to U.S. protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts. That's a play on the slogan for Lebanon's protest movement — Lebanon revolts — which erupted on Oct. 17 last year. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #Americanrevolts became the No. 1 trending tag in Lebanon. In another expression of solidarity with American protesters, about 150 people marched through central Jerusalem on Saturday to protest the shooting death by Israeli police of an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man earlier in the day. Israeli police mistakenly suspected that the man, Iyad Halak, was carrying a weapon. When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire. ___ Associated Press Writers David Rising in Berlin, Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Frances D'Emilio in Rome, Zeina Karam in Beirut, Tia Goldenberg in Jerusalem, Ken Moritsugu in Beijing, Jari Tanner in Helsinki, Finland, and Jim Heintz in Moscow, contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s latest news about the protests in the U.S. at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

U-Stop was not damaged during the uprising, thanks, Whitehead said, to protesters. “In a way it was a little bit inspiring,” Whitehead said. “I would estimate that out of the 200 to 300 people who were there, 5% or less were antagonists. And 10% to 15% of the people were there to physically do the right thing. “As a 64-year-old man standing in front of his business I’m not going to stop anything. But when somebody would pick up a trash can to throw it through the window, there were 15 or 20 people there to stop them, to calm things down, do the right thing. They stopped them. Without that, things could have escalated.” The first violent gathering in Lincoln happened early Saturday at EZ Go, a convenience store at 26th and O streets, where police reported eight injuries and nine incidents of vandalism.",0.0

U.S. law allows terrorist designations for foreign groups since belonging to those groups doesn't enjoy the same protections. Antifa, short for anti-fascists, describes a broad group of people whose positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across. Typically, groups who identify as Antifa are amorphous and don't have a central leadership, though some local activists are highly organized, according to federal law enforcement officials. That has made it difficult for U.S. law enforcement to deal with violence from members of groups that label themselves as Antifa. Federal law enforcement officials told CNN they are aware of outside groups who are behind some of the property destruction and violence, using the cover of the legitimate protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere. Those domestic extremist groups include anarchists, white supremacists and far-left extremists, some of whom have overlapping affiliations.An announcement by the Justice Department on Sunday to use Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country to investigate some of the violence in major cities singles out leftist Antifa activity, though U.S. law enforcement officials say there are groups from both the extremist left and right involved in the riots and attacks on police. In response to the president's tweet, ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi said there is ""no legal authority for designating a domestic group"" as a terrorist organization.""As this tweet demonstrates, terrorism is an inherently political label, easily abused and misused. There is no legal authority for designating a domestic group. Any such designation would raise significant due process and First Amendment concerns.""The Justice Department has studied the issue of creating a domestic terrorism law to apply to people involved in violence and who belong to domestic extremist groups, but the constitutional issues have been a hurdle to that effort.",0.0

Floyd, who was black and was handcuffed, died after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, used his knee to pin down Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. Chauvin now faces third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. In Lincoln, the clash between protesters and police on Saturday heightened in the 11 o'clock hour as tear gas canisters were deployed on those in the crowd who lobbed objects, including fireworks, at law enforcement officers in riot gear. Saturday night's violence followed less than 24 hours after incidents on Saturday morning centered in the area of 27th and O streets.

The announcement on Saturday from the nation's eighth-largest retailer came after Target stores in multiple cities became scenes of violence and unrest. Among the stores where aisles were ransacked was a Target in Minneapolis near the city's 3rd police precinct, where the four officers who were fired after Floyd's death worked. The 3rd Precinct police station was damaged by a fire last week. ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,"" the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. ""At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores."" A Target spokesperson said that the company is evaluating closures and limiting hours on a store-by-store basis. The majority of stores being closed are located in Minnesota and California, where protests in Los Angeles led the National Guard to be deployed. Stores will also close in Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Despite the violence that has hit its stores, the company has voiced support for demonstrators. ""The murder of George Floyd has unleashed the pent-up pain of years, as have the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote in a public letter on Friday. ""We say their names and hold a too-long list of others in our hearts."" It remains unclear whether the looting at Target stores was committed by demonstrators or whether they were the actions of unaffiliated bad actors. But the ongoing demonstrations have focused scrutiny on Target's past work with law enforcement — including partnerships with agencies in at least 2o cities. In Minneapolis, the company partnered with police on a program that helped install closed-circuit television cameras in the downtown area. A 2010 report released with support from the company said the ""genesis of the program was a widespread feeling some years ago in the city of Minneapolis that the downtown business district was not a pleasant place to work or visit.""

I APPRECIATE ALL THE FOLKS ARE COMING OUT TO START SWEEPING UP GLASS AND HELP MANY THINGS UP. IF WE NEED TO BE LOST. CITIES BOTH CITIES BACK IN ORDER AGAIN, FOLKS I NEED TO HAVE PEACE AND CALL. PLEASE STAY HOME TONIGHT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE FEEL SAFE IN THEIR OWN HOMES. AND WE WILL BE DEPLOYING THE NATIONAL GUARD SUPPORT. POLICE AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM. WITH THAT I’M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO CHIEF SCHMADERER WHO’S GOING TO TO SAY A FEW MORE WORDS. THANK YOU GOVERNOR. THANK YOU MAYOR. SO LAST NIGHT WAS ONE OF THE LONGEST NIGHTS. BUT THE CITY OF OMAHA HAS EVER HAD. WE HAD SOME SHOOTINGS SOME ASSAULTS. IT WAS COUNTLESS PROPERTY DAMAGE. THERE WAS VIOLENCE AGAINST THE POLICE. BIG REMAINING EVEN MADE AN ARREST FOR POSSESSION POSSESSION OF A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL. MOLOTOV COCKTAILS WERE WERE THROWN DOWN IN THE OLD MARKET. WE MADE A REST OF SOMEBODY ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE TO THE OMAHA POLICE HEADQUARTERS. THE ARREST WAS OF A WHITE MALE. FROM A CITY OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA LAST NIGHT WE MADE 51 ARREST THE MAJORITY OF THOSE ARRESTS WERE. ABOUT WHITE SUSPECTS. WE ARE IN THE NOW OF COMPILING. ALL THE INFORMATION ON THOSE ARRESTS TO HAVE THAT DISSEMINATED TO THE MEDIA. IT’S PUBLIC INFORMATION. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE FBI HAS AGREED TO LOOK THROUGH ALL OUR ARREST TOO. TO DO A BACKGROUND ON ANY OF THE SUSPECTS THAT WE ARRESTED. LIKE TO GET INTO WHY I ASKED FOR THE ASSISTANCE FROM THE NEST, NEBRASKA, NEBRASKA NATIONAL GUARD FIRST OF ALL THE SCOPE OF WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE LAST NIGHT BECAME EXTREMELY LARGE. STARTED AT 72ND AND DODGE AND THEN MOVE DOWNTOWN TO THE OLD MARKET AREA AND THEN IN A FEW OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY. SO A LOT OF TERRAIN TO COVER AND THEN THE SIZE OF THE CROWDS GREW FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO AN ESTIMATE OF 4,000. THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW. IS WORKING 12-HOUR SHIFTS. A LOT OF FATIGUE AND RESOURCE DEPLETION HAS SET IN. AND AS CHIEF OF THE CITY, I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE. AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SECURITY AND PROTECTION FOR COMMUNITY AND THE FINAL REASON IS I KNEW THAT THERE WAS A POTENTIAL FOR MORE VIOLENCE. SO IN CONSULTATION WITH MY EXECUTIVE STAFF. I CALLED THE MAYOR AND ASK FOR THE MAYOR’S ASSISTANCE TO CONTACT THE GOVERNOR FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD ASSISTANCE. THE GOVERNOR HAS AGREED. AND THE NATIONAL GUARD WILL BE EMBEDDED EMBEDDED WITH THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT. THE LAST THING I WANT AND THAT’S NOT WHO WE ARE DO NOT WANT A MILITARY OCCUPATION THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE WHAT IS A RESOURCE? EXPANDER FOR US THAT WE REALLY THAT WE REALLY NEED RIGHT NOW. WE’LL TALK ABOUT WHY WE CHOSE 8 P.M. AND THE 25 CAPACITY TO START AT 8 TONIGHT. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR THAT IS THERE IS A SIGNATURE EVENT THAT’S TAKING PLACE AT THE MALCOLM X MEMORIAL. IT’S PUT ON BY THE MALCOLM X MEMORIAL FOUNDATION. THAT IS A RALLY. THE PROTESTER WE FELT THE VOICES NEED TO BE HEARD. HORSES ARE VERY SIGNATURE TO WHAT’S GOING ON ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND QUITE FRANKLY I’VE NOT BEEN A PART OF ANY OF THE ANARCHY. THAT WE’VE BEEN DEALING WITH AS A CITY. AS IT RELATES TO ALL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IN THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE FBI AND THE US ATTORNEY’S OFFICE TO DETERMINE IF ANY FEDERAL CHARGES. SO WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSULTATION WITH THEM ON BOTH THOSE FRONTS. I WANT TO TOUCH ON. THE SHOOTING AND THE THE TERRIBLE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED. AT 12:07 -- STREET LAST NIGHT AT TWENTY TO FIFTY DOLLARS. THAT’S 1058. OMAHA POLICE WASN’T AREA RESPONDED TO A SHOOTING WHERE THEY LOCATED THE VICTIM ATTEMPTED TO RENDER AID CALLED THE PARAMEDICS. THE VICTIM WAS TRANSPORTED THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT DID DETAIN. SOMEBODY WHO FIRED THAT WEAPON THAT INDIVIDUAL REMAINS IN OMAHA POLICE CUSTODY. ANY CHARGING OR COOKING DECISION ON THAT FRONT WILL COME FROM THE COUNTY ATTORNEY’S OFFICE. I’VE SPOKEN WITH DON KLEINE AND HE TELLS ME THAT WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A PRESS CONFERENCE. SO BEFORE I TURN THE PODIUM OVER TO KRISTI JOHNSON OF THE FBI. AFTER US ATTORNEY, JOE KELLY TALKS, WE WILL OPEN THIS UP FOR QUESTIONS. WHAT I’M GOING TO ASK IS YOU IDENTIFY THE NEWS ORGANIZATION YOU’RE WITH. WE’LL CALL ON YOU WILL HAVE A MICROPHONE BROUGHT TO YOU. SO THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC PUBLIC CAN HEAR THE QUESTION. AND THAT’S HOW WILL ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU, EVERYONE. GOOD AFTERNOON AS MENTIONED. MY NAME IS KRISTI JOHNSON. I’M A SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE FBI HERE IN OMAHA, AND WE COVER ALL OF NEBRASKA AND ALL OF IOWA. I’M SIMPLY HERE TODAY TO JUST REMIND YOU THAT THE FBI IS A PART OF THIS COMMUNITY AND WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY OUR DUTY TO KEEP THE CITIZENS SAFE TOGETHER WITH OUR STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS. FBI ROUTINELY INVESTIGATES POSSIBLE FEDERAL CRIME OF CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS WHEN WE FIND EVIDENCE OF THESE CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS, WE’VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY’S ATTORNEY’S OFFICE TO BRING CHARGES. WE’D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE FOR THEIR ONGOING EFFORTS TO KEEP KEEP EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY SAFE. SO TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT FEDERAL CHARGES IS OUR UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA JOE KELLY. THANK YOU. ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY IN THIS CASE WOULD BE TO PROSECUTE ANYONE. WHO HAS VIOLATED A FEDERAL LAW? A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE IF SOMEONE FROM OUT OF STATE HAS CROSSED STATE LINES INTO NEBRASKA. WITH THE SPECIFIC INTENT COMMITTING A CRIME OF VIOLENCE THOSE ARE THE SORT OF THINGS WE’RE LOOKING FOR. AS WELL AS PROTECTING THE FREE SPEECH RIGHTS OF EVERY AMERICAN WATCH THE PEACEFULLY. DEMONSTRATE AND PROTEST WE ARE IN AND HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS LIKE THE FBI. STATE PARTNERS SHARING INFORMATION ISN’T ALWAYS THE CASE IN OTHER STATES. THAT IS THE CASE. THIS IS A TOUGH TIME FOR NEBRASKA. AND I THINK WE ALL WANT TO BRING THIS TO A PEACEFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU, JOE. I’M GOING TO START OFF THE FIRST QUESTION WITH WWT WWT IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION. I G PRIME F 36 SO, IS THERE A CORRELATION? RIGHT NOW WE’RE SEEING WE’RE SEEING A DISTINCTION. THERE IS WHAT IS BEING THE SIGNATURE VOICES ON THE GEORGE FORD INCIDENT SHOULD COME FROM? THE VALLEY IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE THE MALCOLM X FOUNDATION. UP TO THIS POINT WE HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF ARRESTS. A PEOPLE THAT WOULD NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT AT ALL. SO THAT’S THAT’S THE WAY I’LL PARSE OUT MY ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BRIAN. JOE YOU’RE NOT FOLLOWING THE RULES OF THE PROCEDURE HERE. SO I’LL WAIT TILL YOU GET A MICROPHONE. GORDON COUNTY, NEBRASK DO YOU MIND IF I I WOULD BE THE ONE ADVISING THE MAYOR AS TO WHAT’S GOING ON IN AND OUT THERE AND THEN OF COURSE THE MAYOR MAKES THE FINAL DECISION, BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT THE CONDITIONS OF THE CITY ARE IF WE FEEL THAT WE NEED TO EXTEND IT THEN I’LL ASK AND THEN THE MARROW MAKE THAT DECISION BUT IT’S ALL GOING TO BE TOWARDS IS ORDER RESTORED IN THE CITY. ARE WE BACK TO NORMAL? AND I THINK SAFE TO RESUME. THOSE ARE THE VERY SIMPLE GUIDELINES. I JUST WANT TO SAY WE WE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS VERY VERY SERIOUSLY THERE HAS NOT BEEN A CURFEW ISSUED IN THE CITY OF OMAHA SINCE PJ MORGAN WAS MAYOR. IT HAS BEEN QUITE A WHILE AND WORK WITH OUR LAW DEPARTMENT VERY CAREFULLY BECAUSE WE EVEN ASKED, YOU KNOW, CAN YOU DO IT FOR PARTS OF TOWN? OH, WELL, IF YOU DO A CURFEW IT HAS TO BE FOR THE ENTIRE CITY OF OMAHA. I HAVE THE ABILITY AND THE AUTHORITY AFTER I DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY. I COULD DO THAT FOR 72 HOURS. AND THAT’S WHY WE SAID THIS CURFEW WILL LAST FOR 72 HOURS ANYTHING BEYOND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND GET THEIR APPROVAL TO DO ANY STATE OF EMERGENCY. AND A CURFEW BEYOND 72 HOURS, SO THAT’S WHY WE PICKED THE 72 HOURS, BUT DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION AND WHAT’S GOING ON. I MAY NEED TO GO ASK ASK THE CITY COUNCIL TO EXTEND THAT. BOAT KNOW WHAT THEY’RE GOING TO DO IS WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSULTATION CONSULTATION WITH THE GENERAL MOHAWK. NEBRASKA NATIONAL GUARD THEY’LL BE EMBEDDED WITH US AND THEY WILL ALLOW US TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND THEY’LL BE BE THERE AS A SUPPORT POLE. FOR INSTANCE YOU’RE GOING TO STILL SEE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT. INTERACTING AND DEALING WITH EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON WITHIN THE NATIONAL GUARD WILL BE A SUPPORT ROLE FOR US AS A RESOURCE MULTIPLIER THAT WE NEED AT THIS POINT TIME JOE. APPRECIATE THIS THOSE QUESTIONS. CAN I GO TO YOU NEXT CHRIS WITH A CAIFA BE YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP? EARLIER TODAY THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT DESIGNATED AS THEY ANTI-FOG AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. TWO QUESTIONS ONE. HAVE YOU FOUND EVIDENCE OF THEM COORDINATING? AND WHAT RESOURCES DOES THAT BRING TO BEAR AS YOU TRY TO IRON THIS OUT AND MAYBE SEARCH FOR MORE IMPORTANT? SO WE HAVEN’T FOUND A DIRECT CONNECTION, BUT THAT’S ALSO WHY I’VE ASKED THE FBI TO ASSIST US WITH GOING THROUGH OUR ARREST LIST. SO THAT’S WHY WE ARE COMMUNICATING CLEARLY ON FRONT OF THAT FRONT. THE SECOND QUESTION REALLY WILL COME INTO PLAY ONCE WE CAN VERIFY CERTAIN FACETS OF WHAT THAT BACKGROUND WILL GO INTO BUT WE’RE WE’RE SO EARLY INTO THIS. WE HAVEN’T DONE THAT YET. K.MICHELLE BANDU WHAT ARE YOU HEARING? WHAT CHANGES CAN BE MADE IN IT? SO WHAT CHANGES CAN ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE TO MAKE IT BETTER? FIRST OF ALL MICHELLE I ALWAYS SAY THAT WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE. HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EVERYBODY ARE KNEELING TOGETHER ON THIS. THERE’S NOT A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS THE WHAT TOOK PLACE ON THAT INCIDENT. SO THAT’S A BEAUTIFUL STARTING POINT FOR US. AND I WAS LIKE A COMMON GROUND TO START TO SPRINGBOARD THINGS ON. AND WITHIN ALL THE LAYERS THAT THAT WE CAN DO THAT I COULD PROBABLY TALK FOR FOUR DAYS ON INTERNAL THINGS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT. BUT LET’S FOCUS TODAY ON THE COMMON GROUND OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BUILD UP FROM THAT. AND IF THERE’S ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THAT I’LL STEP ASIDE. I JUST WANTED TO BRING UP TO THAT. NO, WE ALL AGREE. I DON’T THINK THERE’S ANY POLICE OFFICER IN OMAHA. THAT DOESN’T FEEL LIKE THERE SHOULD BE JUSTICE BUT DEMONSTRATING AND DESTROYING PUBLIC PROPERTY AND OMAHA. NEBRASKA IS NOT GOING TO BRING JUSTICE. DID GEORGE FLOYD THAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN UP IN MINNEAPOLIS MINNESOTA, BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT SINCE I HAVE BEEN MARRIED ALMOST SEVEN YEARS NOW. I HAVE SEEN THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT CHIEF SCHMADERER IN HIS COMMAND STAFF. THEY’RE STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY MAKE REMARKABLE PROGRESS ON COMMUNITY-POLICE RELATIONS. THEY HAVE WORKED VERY HARD ON IT. THEY BELIEVED IN COMMUNITY POLICING THEY ARE OUT THERE WORKING AND ENGAGING THE PUBLIC ALL OF THE TIME. I THINK WE’VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS. I’M AND EARLIER THE DEATH OF CARRIER. RASCA OROSCO IT BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER IN OMAHA. NOT JUST THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, BUT THE ENTIRE CITY THERE WAS GOOD THAT CAME OUT OF THAT TRAGEDY AND EVERYBODY IN OMAHA FOR A WHILE WAS WEARING THE SUPPORT BLUE T-SHIRTS. SO GENERALLY I FEEL LIKE THE WORK THEY’VE ALREADY DONE HAS REALLY IMPROVED POLICE-COMMUNITY RELATIONS. WE CAN ALWAYS IMPROVE BUT GENERALLY THE PEOPLE IN OMAHA RESPECT THE JOB THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT DOES I MENTIONED THIS THE OTHER DAY WE VERY FEW ARE COMPLAINTS THAT COME TO US FOR EXCESSIVE FORCE. GENERALLY. THERE’S A LOT OF SUPPORT AND A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT. THAT’S WHY IT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THIS VIOLENCE IS NOT COMING FROM FELLOW OMAHA’S THAT A LOT OF THIS VIOLENCE IS BEING IN CITED BY OTHERS WHO JUST WANT TO HAVE A VOICE BUT HAVING A VOICE IN VIOLENCE IS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. SO WE ARE WE’RE ALL LISTENING AND WE UNDERSTAND AND WE ALL AGREE AND WE ALL FEEL THE SAME WAY THERE. TO BE JUSTICE AND WE FEEL WHAT HAPPENED IN MINNESOTA WAS TERRIBLE, BUT JUSTICE IS NOT VIOLENCE IN THE CITY OF OMAHA, AND WE’VE GOT TO MOVE FORWARD AND WE’VE GOT TO UNITE TOGETHER AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER. WE WILL ALWAYS ALWAYS STRIVE TO BE BETTER. IF ANYBODY SAYS WE’RE AS GOOD AS WE CAN BE THE FIRST ONE TO SAY WERE WRONG, BUT WE WILL ALWAYS STRIVE TO BE BETTER, BUT I THINK THAT THEY HAVE MADE REMARKABLE PROGRESS AND I WANT TO SEE THAT PROGRESS CONTINUE. DOCTOR THANK YOU. ALSO MICHELLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE’VE BEEN DOING IN MY ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO REACHING OUT TO LEADERS IN NORTH AND SOUTH OMAHA. OBVIOUSLY BEEN WORKING WITH REGARD TO THIS PANDEMIC. WE’VE HAD CONVERSATIONS THOUGH ALSO ABOUT DIRECTOR FRAKES HAVING PHONE CALLS WITH TIME VANDANA CAN’T DO A MEET IN PERSON MEETINGS. BUT WITH NORTH OMAHA LEADERS, AND I’D REFER FOLKS TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE PLANNING ON WORKING ON TO THE PRESS RELEASE. WE PUT OUT OVER A WEEK AGO WITH REGARD TO SOME OF THE STEPS. NOT ONLY ADDRESS THE PANDEMIC ISSUES IN NORTH AND SOUTH OMAHA, BUT ALSO WORK ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUES TO BE ABLE TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE IN NORTH AND SOUTH OMAHA. SO THESE ARE THE TYPES OF STEPS THAT WE GOT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS. I JUST ECHO WHAT THE MAYOR SAID THE VIOLENCE IS NOT PUSHING THOSE THINGS FOR WE UNDERSTAND PEOPLE’S CONCERNS AND WE KNOW WE GOT TO DO MORE WE GOT TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE BUT THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER. IN FACT, I THINK IT JUST REALLY JUST WORKS THE OPPOSITE JUST REALLY KIND OF DENIGRATES THE MEMORY OF GEORGE FLOYD WHAT I DON’T THINK HE WOULD HAVE WON. SO HE WOULD HAVE WANTED US TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY MORE RELATING BETTER RELATIONSHIPS TO BE ABLE TO HELP FOLKS WITH HIS IPHONE. MONA I’M GOING TO WITH CHICK WASIKOWSKA FROM CHANNEL 3. WELL, HE WASN’T RELEASED ONCE HE WAS DETAINED. HE’S BEEN IN OUR CUSTODY EVER SINCE. TOM BECC THANK YOU. CHIEF VIDEO OF THE SHOOTING LAST NIGHT. TOM LET ME SAY THIS I’VE BEEN A PRIZE THAT THERE’S SOME VIDEO I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THE LOGISTICS OF THE THE ECOSYSTEM THAT’S PLAYING OUT RIGHT NOW, SO I HAVEN’T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DIVE DEEPLY INTO THAT THE COUNTY ATTORNEY IS INDICATED TO ME THAT HE’LL HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE WHEN HE MAKES HIS DECISION THAT AND THE DECISION TO BOOK OR WE’LL COME FROM THE COUNTY ATTORNEY’S POSITION, BUT HE’S CURRENTLY IN CUSTODY THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT. WE’RE VERY FORTUNATE THAT WE’RE GOING TO BE RECEIVING MILITARY POLICE. THEY’LL HAVE THEY’LL HAVE THAT EXTRA TRAINING AND THAT MILITARY POLICE BACKGROUND WHICH WOULD BE WHICH IS OUR BEST CASE SCENARIO WHEN IN AND WORKING WITH US. SO THEY’LL BE ARMED AND EVERYTHING JUST LIKE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. CHRIS I CAN TREAT THE INDIVIDUAL FROM OUT-OF-STATE ARRESTED WITH THE BALL TOP COCKTAIL. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT STATE? HE’S FROM COUNT THINGS IOWA COUNCIL BLUFFS, MAYBE. NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE ON THAT, BUT WE’LL GET TO THE PACKET OF WE’RE ALL THAT’S FROM YET ANOTHER QUESTION. YOU’RE WELCOME. CONCERNING THE MURDER LAST NIGHT FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGH WELL I’M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE MURDER INVESTIGATION. OKAY, THEY THE INFRACTIONS THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PANDEMIC. FRACTIONS ARE MAIN THING TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW. LIKE I SAID THE CHARGING DECISION. IT IS THAT COMES FROM THE COUNTY ATTORNEY. I’M THE CHIEF OF POLICE. YOU MAKE THE DETAINMENT COUNTY ATTORNEY MAKES THE CHARGING DECISION. THAT’S THAT’S HOW THAT THAT’S HOW THAT WORKS. OKAY. SO I’M BRIAN MASTER. BRIAN HAVEN’T HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO ANYBODY’S FAMILY AND YOU HEARD ME EARLIER SAY THAT I HAVEN’T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE OF THE ECOSYSTEM OF EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH TO DIVE INTO THAT PARTICULAR CASE CASE TO TO AN INFINITE LEVEL. YOUR TICKET ONE OR TWO MORE QUESTIONS. YES, SIR. WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE? IF PROPERTY OWNERS FEEL THAT THEY NEED TO DO AN EXTRA LEVEL OF PROTECTION A LOT OF THE BUSINESSES ALONG 72ND STREET HAVE ELECTED TO PUT PLYWOOD ON FRONT OF THEIR WINDOWS THINGS LIKE THAT REALIZE THAT WE’VE TAKEN GREAT EXTRA MEASURES AS A CITY HERE TODAY TO TRY TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY’S PROPERTY AND SAFETY IS SECURE. SO THOSE ARE A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING DONE. I DO NOT CONDONE ANY VIGILANTE ACTIONS IF THAT’S THE NATURE OF IN THE PREMISE BEHIND YOUR QUESTION. I DO NOT CONDONE THAT AT ALL. THAT’S THAT’S WHERE IT’S GOING AND I’M NOT SURE IF IT WAS APOLOGIZE IF I HAD LIVED TOO MUCH. LET’S DO. ST. COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS, SO I’M GOING TO GO TO RICK ROUBLES ON MY WORLD HERALD THEN I’LL GO TO YOU ROGER. PLEASE MAN, YOU SAID THAT? AREA OKAY, YEAH. THANK YOU, BROTHER. ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE WAY? HAS OUTSIDE INFLUENCE YOU’RE MOVING FORWARD TO BRINGING THE FIRST OF ALL, I AM PROUD OF YOU MOM POLICE DEPARTMENT. THEY HAVE PERFORMED VERY WELL IN A A VERY EXTREMELY HARD CIRCUMSTANCES. I ASKED ANYBODY THAT SITS BACK AND WANTS TO MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK EVERYTHING. IMAGINE IF YOU HAD TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATIONS THAT WE’VE DEALT WITH IN THE CITY FOR THE LAST COUPLE DAYS, WE’VE HANDLED IT AS BEST WE COULD. AS PROFESSIONALS WE COULD HAVE EVERYTHING PERFECT. ARE WE LEARNING AND ADAPTING AS WE GO? OF COURSE? WHAT IS THE SECOND QUESTION AGAIN? HOW DO YOU REMEMBER THE COMMUNITY WEDNESDAY? FIRST OF ALL THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE COMMUNITY HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP AND WE HAD A WORKING RELATIONSHIP AND PARTNERSHIP AND WE KNEW HOW TO ADDRESS ISSUES AS THEY AROSE. AND THAT WAS INTERCEPTED AND INTERRUPTED RIGHT NOW. IN PART IN PART BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC BUT IN PART BECAUSE OF THE AGITATORS THAT HAVE CAUSED SO MUCH. PROBLEMS IN OUR COMMUNITY SO I CANNOT WAIT TO GET BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN WE ARE DEALING DIRECTLY WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS WHO QUITE FRANKLY HAVE BEEN GOOD TO US AND WE HAVE TRIED TO STEP UP HONORABLY AND RETURN. ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE QUESTION AND THEN WE GOT TO GO SURE. I WANTED TO SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT CHIEF SCHMADERER. I’VE WORKED WITH HIM FOR SEVEN YEARS NOW AND HE IS A NO-NONSENSE POLICE CHIEF. HE TAKES THINGS VERY VERY SERIOUSLY. HE PRAISES HIS OFFICERS WHEN HE NEEDS TO PRAISE THEM AND MANY TIMES HE DOES BECAUSE I AGREE WITH HIM. I THINK THEY DO A GREAT JOB FOR THE CITY OF OMAHA, BUT I HAVE ALSO SEEN HIM DEAL WITH PROBLEMS AND HE TAKES THOSE PROBLEMS VERY SERIOUSLY. HE WILL IMMEDIATELY INVESTIGATE. HE’S THOROUGH HE WILL DISCIPLINE AND HE WILL TERMINATE THAT’S THE KIND OF CHIEF HE IS SO HE IS YOU KNOW, WE ARE ALWAYS PROUD OF OUR OFFICERS, BUT IF THERE IS A COMPLAINT AGAINST AN OFFICER FOR EXCESSIVE FORCE OR ANYTHING ELSE I CAN GUARANTEE YOU ALL IT IS ALWAYS INVESTIGATED, BUT WE CAN ALWAYS BE BETTER. WE KNOW WE CAN DO THAT AND I MENTIONED THIS THE OTHER DAY. COULD I ADD ONE MORE LAYER? WE CREATED A CITIZEN COMPLAINT REVIEW BOARD THAT IF A COMPLAINT ABOUT AN OFFICER COMES THROUGH THE CHIEF AND IN THE COMPLAINTANT ISN’T HAPPY WITH THE RESULT. THEY HAVE ANOTHER OPTION THAT THEY CAN. TO THE CITIZEN COMPLAINT BOARD AND HAVE A BOARD OF CITIZENS REVIEW WHAT THE COMPLAINT IS AND MAKE SUGGESTIONS. SO I WILL I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE HE HAS DONE A VERY VERY GOOD JOB. I WANT TO GET BACK TO THOSE DAYS WHEN PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE SAYING SUPPORT BLUE. I KNOW THE MAJORITY OF CITIZENS IN OMAHA FEEL THAT WAY TOO AND AT ONE MORE THING I DO WANT TO ADD IS I REALLY WANT TO THANK SO MANY VOLUNTEERS AND SO MANY CITIZENS OF OMAHA THAT I SAW COME DOWNTOWN THIS MORNING AND SAY WHAT CAN I DO? I MEAN THEY ARE CLEANING UP DOWNTOWN WITHOUT ASKING ANYBODY IF THEY WILL DO THAT. I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT-OUT TO LOWE’S THE MANAGER LOWS CALLED ME EARLY THIS MORNING AND SAID, DO YOU NEED PLYWOOD I’LL BRING IT DOWN DELIVER IT AND I’LL GIVE IT TO YOU AND THIS AFTERNOON HE DELIVERED OVER 320 HUGE SHEETS OF PLYWOOD SO DOWNTOWN THEY COULD USE IT TO BOARD UP ALL THE WINDOWS THAT WERE BROKEN. SO THAT’S THAT’S WHAT OMAHA HAS ARE REALLY LIKE THEY’RE WORKING TOGETHER. THEY WANT TO GET THROUGH THIS THEY WANT TO GET BACK TO NORMAL AGAIN, AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HAPPEN SOON. OKAY LAST QUESTION, GO AHEAD. SURE. WELL, I MEAN WE DIDN’T OKAY, I DID AN INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT RIGHT NEAR THE END OF THE PROTESTS WHERE I LAID OUT ALL THE REASONS WHY IT HAD TO BE DECLARED AN UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY THAT ROCKS WERE BEING THROWN AT LAW ENFORCEMENT.

OKAY, BUT WE HAVE TRIED IN OUR OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS WERE TO GIVE EVERY EVERY POSSIBLE LEEWAY POSSIBLE TO HAVE A PEACEFUL PROTEST.

1621777227,2020-05-31 17:34:00,What is Antifa?,https://www.ketv.com/article/what-is-antifa-2020/32723769,en,False,,101117,ketv.com,http://www.ketv.com/#spider,"Anti-fascist counter-protesters wait outside Lee Park to hurl insults as white nationalists, neo-Nazis and members of the ""alt-right"" are forced out after the ""Unite the Right"" rally was declared an unlawful gathering August 12, 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia. Advertisement What is Antifa? Share Shares Copy Link Copy As protests over George Floyd's death spread across the country, officials have blamed the violent nature of some demonstrations on members of a controversial group known as Antifa.President Donald Trump on Sunday said the United States would designate Antifa a terrorist organization, though the federal government has no legal authority to label a wholly domestic group the way it designates foreign terrorist organizations.Speaking at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday, Trump said the recent ""violence and vandalism"" seen across the country ""is being led by Antifa and other radical left-wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down buildings.""The president did not provide any evidence for his assertion.National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien echoed Trump's comments on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday morning, telling Jake Tapper that the violence ""is being driven by Antifa.""CNN has not independently verified whether the group is involved in recent protests.Here's a closer look at Antifa protesters, who have become more visible in the last several years.What is Antifa?Antifa is short for anti-fascists. The term is used to define a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far left — but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. The group doesn't have an official leader or headquarters, although groups in certain states hold regular meetings.Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across.Scott Crow, a former Antifa organizer, says the ""radical ideals"" promoted by Antifas are starting to be adopted by liberals. ""They would never have looked at (those ideals) before, because they saw us as the enemy as much as the right-wingers.""The majority of Antifa members don't fall into a stereotype. Since the election of President Trump, however, most new Antifa members are young voters.How did the group start?The exact origins of the group are unknown, but Antifa can be traced to Nazi Germany and Anti-Fascist Action, a militant group founded in the 1980s in the United Kingdom.Modern-day Antifa members have become more active in making themselves known at public rallies and within the progressive movement, says Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.""What they're trying to do now is not only become prominent through violence at these high-profile rallies, but also to reach out through small meetings and through social networking to cultivate disenfranchised progressives who heretofore were peaceful,"" Levin said.Where do they protest?Members have been spotted at high-profile, right-wing events across the country.In August 2017 members of the group showed up in Charlottesville, Virginia, to condemn racism and counter protest hundreds of white nationalists opposed to the removal of a Gen. Robert E. Lee statue. The protests turned violent when James Fields, who is not a member of Antifa, plowed his car through a crowd of counter protesters, killing Heather Heyer.Video above: President Trump Says There Were 'Bad Dudes on the Other Side' in CharlottesvilleEarlier that year, Antifa protested the appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos, an alt-right provocateur, at the University of California, Berkeley. They also protested President Trump's inauguration in 2017.While it can be difficult to distinguish Antifa activists from other protesters, some dress head to toe in black. Members call this the ""Black Bloc.""They also wear masks to hide their identities from the police and whomever they are protesting.Why are they controversial?The group is known for causing damage to property during protests. In Berkeley, black-clad protesters wearing masks threw Molotov cocktails and smashed windows at the student union center where the Yiannopoulos event was to be held.Crow, who was involved with Antifa for almost 30 years, said members use violence as a means of self-defense and they believe property destruction does not equate to violence.""There is a place for violence. Is that the world that we want to live in? No. Is it the world we want to inhabit? No. Is it the world we want to create? No. But will we push back? Yes,"" Crow said.Levin said Antifa activists feel the need to partake in violence because ""they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist.""""There's this 'It's going down' mentality and this 'Hit them with your boots' mentality that goes back many decades to confrontations that took place, not only here in the American South, but also in places like Europe,"" he added.White nationalists and other members of the so-called alt-right have denounced members of Antifa, sometimes calling them the ""alt-left."" Many white nationalists from the Charlottesville rallies claimed it was the Antifa groups that led the protests to turn violent.Peter Cvjetanovic, a white nationalist who attended the Virginia protests, said he believes the far left, including Antifa, are ""just as dangerous, if not more dangerous than the right wing could ever be.""""These are people who preach tolerance and love while at the same time threatening people with a different political ideology. We go to our rallies and they harass us and attack us but they held theirs and we ignore them. You don't see right-wing protests get like this,"" Cvjetanovic told KRNV.But Crow said the philosophy of Antifa is based on the idea of direct action. ""The idea in Antifa is that we go where they (right-wingers) go. That hate speech is not free speech. That if you are endangering people with what you say and the actions that are behind them, then you do not have the right to do that.""And so we go to cause conflict, to shut them down where they are, because we don't believe that Nazis or fascists of any stripe should have a mouthpiece.""",0.0

""Seeing all the destruction, I thought we need to try to come together this morning,"" said Codie Strese, who helped clean up damage at downtown businesses.Several windows were smashed and vandalized after Friday and Saturday night's protests.Over at 72nd and Dodge Streets, a group of University of Nebraska-Omaha students were also hard at work.""I was born and raised here, so I feel an obligation and responsibility to make sure that our community is kept right,"" Kaia Phelps said.Phelps, a senior criminal justice and black studies major, organized the cleanup with her friends. ""I believe there was a different narrative going around that Black Lives Matter started all of the throwing of bricks and pushing over police officers,"" Phelps said. Phelps said the cleanup is also a protest, though.""We may not have signs, we may not be yelling, we may not have our fist in the air, but we are saying that, 'We have a place here. We belong here,'"" Phelps told KETV Newswatch 7.

A protester runs past burning cars and buildings on Chicago Avenue, Saturday, May 30, 2020, in St. Paul, Minn. Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. “Before our operation kicked off last night, a very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers was executed,” Walz said. “That’s not somebody sitting in their basement. That’s pretty sophisticated.” Walz did not offer details. President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against “violent radical agitators” who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops “easy targets,” two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal “kit,” meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to hundreds of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “I think mostly they don’t want to hurt these protests. They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. “It’s very scattershot,” she said. “They are all talking about it, but they don’t seem to be able to translate that online fantasizing about what they’d like to do into real-world action, which is good.” Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy. “They had tools to break windows and tools or a strategy to distribute materials, among them,” she said. ""The thing that we're struck by is that it was an organized group that appeared more bent on destruction on then on protest.” ___ Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey in Minneapolis; Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Md.; Michael Biesecker in Reston, Va.; David Klepper in Providence, Rhode Island; and James LaPorta in Delray Beach, Fla., contributed to this report.

They ran back and forth again and again, searching through the buildings for more fires, Siebe said. The tear gas stung their eyes, and Lehmkuhl said he was hit with a rubber bullet. Then, Siebe said, law enforcement moving down Lincoln Mall stopped them, told them to put their hands up and get on the ground. ""All I remember is thinking 'Man, I really hope I don't get shot,'"" Siebe said.

Police custody. The rage out there is predictable. It's understandable, and it's legitimate. Unfortunately, it's being expressed right now over the past week in ways that are destructive. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, praise those who kept their protests peaceful. The raw emotions were on display, and, as I said yesterday, the beautiful expression of solidarity in community that we saw played out by peaceful protestors demonstrations elsewhere Saturday also began peacefully, right. More than two dozen cities nationwide had nighttime curfews in place, and protesters came out anyway, in some cases descending into chaos and destruction. Mayor Kesha Let's bottoms have seen two straight nights of protests in Atlanta. Right now we're talking about cars being burned and businesses being vandalized, and there's still so many issues that are right before us that we've lost. Sign up.

""I've never seen that.""As they knelt, one protester reeled off the names of other black people who had died, including Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery.Even as cities around the country have been rocked for days by violent protests, similar heartening scenes emerged over the weekend. In Florida Saturday, several officers from various agencies knelt with protesters in prayer in front of Coral Gables City Hall.In Oklahoma, photos captured the powerful moment when sheriff's deputies at the Oklahoma County Jail took a knee in solidarity with the protesters. Some officers were also seen talking to and hugging the protesters.In Iowa, Des Moines law enforcement took a knee outside of the Des Moines Police Department with protesters in solidarity.Shortly before 9 p.m. Sunday, protesters asked authorities to kneel with them in solidarity of George Floyd's death. Authorities kneeled with protesters for two minutes. After the moment was done, protesters dispersed from the area for the time being.""We've talked about many times in this building and everybody, every man and woman in the Des Moines Police Department knows what happened up there was wrong,"" said Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert. ""That's not what this is about. We've had a lot of violence. We've had a lot of unrest. But, what we saw tonight was a peaceful protest."" In Michigan, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson walked with protesters after they chanted ""walk with us!""""Let's go, let's go,"" Swanson said as he and the cheering crowd proceeded.

That's the moment I'm looking for.""The NYPD's 103rd Precinct is near where the march was held in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, so police knew about it in advance and were there.A pastor invited the officers to come into the circle of protesters to kneel with them, which was greeted with cheers from the crowd.All of the officers didn't kneel, Abraham said.Abraham said it was very nice of those officers who did kneel, but it was only a start.""I really want to be clear that that's not enough.

Floyd, who was black and was handcuffed, died after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, used his knee to pin down Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. Chauvin now faces third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. In Lincoln, the clash between protesters and police on Saturday heightened in the 11 o'clock hour as tear gas canisters were deployed on those in the crowd who lobbed objects, including fireworks, at law enforcement officers in riot gear. Saturday night's violence followed less than 24 hours after incidents on Saturday morning centered in the area of 27th and O streets.

Floyd, who was black and was handcuffed, died after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, used his knee to pin down Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder in the death; the other officers have not been charged. Dario Rossin, a 17-year-old Lincoln High student, said he was helping organize the protests because he and many others are tired of systemic racism and prejudice in this nation, which was highlighted by Floyd's death.

WITH THAT I’M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO CHIEF SCHMADERER WHO’S GOING TO TO SAY A FEW MORE WORDS. THANK YOU GOVERNOR. THANK YOU MAYOR. SO LAST NIGHT WAS ONE OF THE LONGEST NIGHTS. BUT THE CITY OF OMAHA HAS EVER HAD. WE HAD SOME SHOOTINGS SOME ASSAULTS. IT WAS COUNTLESS PROPERTY DAMAGE. THERE WAS VIOLENCE AGAINST THE POLICE. BIG REMAINING EVEN MADE AN ARREST FOR POSSESSION POSSESSION OF A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL. MOLOTOV COCKTAILS WERE WERE THROWN DOWN IN THE OLD MARKET. WE MADE A REST OF SOMEBODY ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE TO THE OMAHA POLICE HEADQUARTERS. THE ARREST WAS OF A WHITE MALE. FROM A CITY OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA LAST NIGHT WE MADE 51 ARREST THE MAJORITY OF THOSE ARRESTS WERE. ABOUT WHITE SUSPECTS. WE ARE IN THE NOW OF COMPILING. ALL THE INFORMATION ON THOSE ARRESTS TO HAVE THAT DISSEMINATED TO THE MEDIA. IT’S PUBLIC INFORMATION. IN ADDITION TO THAT THE FBI HAS AGREED TO LOOK THROUGH ALL OUR ARREST TOO. TO DO A BACKGROUND ON ANY OF THE SUSPECTS THAT WE ARRESTED. LIKE TO GET INTO WHY I ASKED FOR THE ASSISTANCE FROM THE NEST, NEBRASKA, NEBRASKA NATIONAL GUARD FIRST OF ALL THE SCOPE OF WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE LAST NIGHT BECAME EXTREMELY LARGE. STARTED AT 72ND AND DODGE AND THEN MOVE DOWNTOWN TO THE OLD MARKET AREA AND THEN IN A FEW OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY. SO A LOT OF TERRAIN TO COVER AND THEN THE SIZE OF THE CROWDS GREW FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO AN ESTIMATE OF 4,000. THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW. IS WORKING 12-HOUR SHIFTS. A LOT OF FATIGUE AND RESOURCE DEPLETION HAS SET IN. AND AS CHIEF OF THE CITY, I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE. AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SECURITY AND PROTECTION FOR COMMUNITY AND THE FINAL REASON IS I KNEW THAT THERE WAS A POTENTIAL FOR MORE VIOLENCE. SO IN CONSULTATION WITH MY EXECUTIVE STAFF. I CALLED THE MAYOR AND ASK FOR THE MAYOR’S ASSISTANCE TO CONTACT THE GOVERNOR FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD ASSISTANCE. THE GOVERNOR HAS AGREED. AND THE NATIONAL GUARD WILL BE EMBEDDED EMBEDDED WITH THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT. THE LAST THING I WANT AND THAT’S NOT WHO WE ARE DO NOT WANT A MILITARY OCCUPATION THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE WHAT IS A RESOURCE? EXPANDER FOR US THAT WE REALLY THAT WE REALLY NEED RIGHT NOW. WE’LL TALK ABOUT WHY WE CHOSE 8 P.M. AND THE 25 CAPACITY TO START AT 8 TONIGHT. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR THAT IS THERE IS A SIGNATURE EVENT THAT’S TAKING PLACE AT THE MALCOLM X MEMORIAL. IT’S PUT ON BY THE MALCOLM X MEMORIAL FOUNDATION. THAT IS A RALLY. THE PROTESTER WE FELT THE VOICES NEED TO BE HEARD. HORSES ARE VERY SIGNATURE TO WHAT’S GOING ON ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND QUITE FRANKLY I’VE NOT BEEN A PART OF ANY OF THE ANARCHY. THAT WE’VE BEEN DEALING WITH AS A CITY. AS IT RELATES TO ALL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IN THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE FBI AND THE US ATTORNEY’S OFFICE TO DETERMINE IF ANY FEDERAL CHARGES. SO WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSULTATION WITH THEM ON BOTH THOSE FRONTS. I WANT TO TOUCH ON. THE SHOOTING AND THE THE TERRIBLE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED. AT 12:07 -- STREET LAST NIGHT AT TWENTY TO FIFTY DOLLARS. THAT’S 1058. OMAHA POLICE WASN’T AREA RESPONDED TO A SHOOTING WHERE THEY LOCATED THE VICTIM ATTEMPTED TO RENDER AID CALLED THE PARAMEDICS. THE VICTIM WAS TRANSPORTED THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT DID DETAIN. SOMEBODY WHO FIRED THAT WEAPON THAT INDIVIDUAL REMAINS IN OMAHA POLICE CUSTODY. ANY CHARGING OR COOKING DECISION ON THAT FRONT WILL COME FROM THE COUNTY ATTORNEY’S OFFICE. I’VE SPOKEN WITH DON KLEINE AND HE TELLS ME THAT WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A PRESS CONFERENCE. SO BEFORE I TURN THE PODIUM OVER TO KRISTI JOHNSON OF THE FBI. AFTER US ATTORNEY, JOE KELLY TALKS, WE WILL OPEN THIS UP FOR QUESTIONS. WHAT I’M GOING TO ASK IS YOU IDENTIFY THE NEWS ORGANIZATION YOU’RE WITH. WE’LL CALL ON YOU WILL HAVE A MICROPHONE BROUGHT TO YOU. SO THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC PUBLIC CAN HEAR THE QUESTION. AND THAT’S HOW WILL ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU, EVERYONE. GOOD AFTERNOON AS MENTIONED. MY NAME IS KRISTI JOHNSON. I’M A SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE FBI HERE IN OMAHA, AND WE COVER ALL OF NEBRASKA AND ALL OF IOWA. I’M SIMPLY HERE TODAY TO JUST REMIND YOU THAT THE FBI IS A PART OF THIS COMMUNITY AND WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY OUR DUTY TO KEEP THE CITIZENS SAFE TOGETHER WITH OUR STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS. FBI ROUTINELY INVESTIGATES POSSIBLE FEDERAL CRIME OF CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS WHEN WE FIND EVIDENCE OF THESE CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS, WE’VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY’S ATTORNEY’S OFFICE TO BRING CHARGES. WE’D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE FOR THEIR ONGOING EFFORTS TO KEEP KEEP EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY SAFE. SO TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT FEDERAL CHARGES IS OUR UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA JOE KELLY. THANK YOU. ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY IN THIS CASE WOULD BE TO PROSECUTE ANYONE. WHO HAS VIOLATED A FEDERAL LAW? A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE IF SOMEONE FROM OUT OF STATE HAS CROSSED STATE LINES INTO NEBRASKA. WITH THE SPECIFIC INTENT COMMITTING A CRIME OF VIOLENCE THOSE ARE THE SORT OF THINGS WE’RE LOOKING FOR. AS WELL AS PROTECTING THE FREE SPEECH RIGHTS OF EVERY AMERICAN WATCH THE PEACEFULLY. DEMONSTRATE AND PROTEST WE ARE IN AND HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS LIKE THE FBI. STATE PARTNERS SHARING INFORMATION ISN’T ALWAYS THE CASE IN OTHER STATES. THAT IS THE CASE. THIS IS A TOUGH TIME FOR NEBRASKA. AND I THINK WE ALL WANT TO BRING THIS TO A PEACEFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU, JOE. I’M GOING TO START OFF THE FIRST QUESTION WITH WWT WWT IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION. I G PRIME F 36 SO, IS THERE A CORRELATION? RIGHT NOW WE’RE SEEING WE’RE SEEING A DISTINCTION. THERE IS WHAT IS BEING THE SIGNATURE VOICES ON THE GEORGE FORD INCIDENT SHOULD COME FROM? THE VALLEY IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE THE MALCOLM X FOUNDATION. UP TO THIS POINT WE HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF ARRESTS. A PEOPLE THAT WOULD NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT AT ALL. SO THAT’S THAT’S THE WAY I’LL PARSE OUT MY ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BRIAN. JOE YOU’RE NOT FOLLOWING THE RULES OF THE PROCEDURE HERE. SO I’LL WAIT TILL YOU GET A MICROPHONE. GORDON COUNTY, NEBRASK DO YOU MIND IF I I WOULD BE THE ONE ADVISING THE MAYOR AS TO WHAT’S GOING ON IN AND OUT THERE AND THEN OF COURSE THE MAYOR MAKES THE FINAL DECISION, BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT THE CONDITIONS OF THE CITY ARE IF WE FEEL THAT WE NEED TO EXTEND IT THEN I’LL ASK AND THEN THE MARROW MAKE THAT DECISION BUT IT’S ALL GOING TO BE TOWARDS IS ORDER RESTORED IN THE CITY. ARE WE BACK TO NORMAL? AND I THINK SAFE TO RESUME. THOSE ARE THE VERY SIMPLE GUIDELINES. I JUST WANT TO SAY WE WE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS VERY VERY SERIOUSLY THERE HAS NOT BEEN A CURFEW ISSUED IN THE CITY OF OMAHA SINCE PJ MORGAN WAS MAYOR. IT HAS BEEN QUITE A WHILE AND WORK WITH OUR LAW DEPARTMENT VERY CAREFULLY BECAUSE WE EVEN ASKED, YOU KNOW, CAN YOU DO IT FOR PARTS OF TOWN? OH, WELL, IF YOU DO A CURFEW IT HAS TO BE FOR THE ENTIRE CITY OF OMAHA. I HAVE THE ABILITY AND THE AUTHORITY AFTER I DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY. I COULD DO THAT FOR 72 HOURS. AND THAT’S WHY WE SAID THIS CURFEW WILL LAST FOR 72 HOURS ANYTHING BEYOND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND GET THEIR APPROVAL TO DO ANY STATE OF EMERGENCY. AND A CURFEW BEYOND 72 HOURS, SO THAT’S WHY WE PICKED THE 72 HOURS, BUT DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION AND WHAT’S GOING ON. I MAY NEED TO GO ASK ASK THE CITY COUNCIL TO EXTEND THAT. BOAT KNOW WHAT THEY’RE GOING TO DO IS WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSULTATION CONSULTATION WITH THE GENERAL MOHAWK. NEBRASKA NATIONAL GUARD THEY’LL BE EMBEDDED WITH US AND THEY WILL ALLOW US TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND THEY’LL BE BE THERE AS A SUPPORT POLE. FOR INSTANCE YOU’RE GOING TO STILL SEE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT. INTERACTING AND DEALING WITH EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON WITHIN THE NATIONAL GUARD WILL BE A SUPPORT ROLE FOR US AS A RESOURCE MULTIPLIER THAT WE NEED AT THIS POINT TIME JOE. APPRECIATE THIS THOSE QUESTIONS. CAN I GO TO YOU NEXT CHRIS WITH A CAIFA BE YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP? EARLIER TODAY THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT DESIGNATED AS THEY ANTI-FOG AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. TWO QUESTIONS ONE. HAVE YOU FOUND EVIDENCE OF THEM COORDINATING? AND WHAT RESOURCES DOES THAT BRING TO BEAR AS YOU TRY TO IRON THIS OUT AND MAYBE SEARCH FOR MORE IMPORTANT? SO WE HAVEN’T FOUND A DIRECT CONNECTION, BUT THAT’S ALSO WHY I’VE ASKED THE FBI TO ASSIST US WITH GOING THROUGH OUR ARREST LIST. SO THAT’S WHY WE ARE COMMUNICATING CLEARLY ON FRONT OF THAT FRONT. THE SECOND QUESTION REALLY WILL COME INTO PLAY ONCE WE CAN VERIFY CERTAIN FACETS OF WHAT THAT BACKGROUND WILL GO INTO BUT WE’RE WE’RE SO EARLY INTO THIS. WE HAVEN’T DONE THAT YET. K.MICHELLE BANDU WHAT ARE YOU HEARING? WHAT CHANGES CAN BE MADE IN IT? SO WHAT CHANGES CAN ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE TO MAKE IT BETTER? FIRST OF ALL MICHELLE I ALWAYS SAY THAT WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE. HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EVERYBODY ARE KNEELING TOGETHER ON THIS. THERE’S NOT A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS THE WHAT TOOK PLACE ON THAT INCIDENT. SO THAT’S A BEAUTIFUL STARTING POINT FOR US. AND I WAS LIKE A COMMON GROUND TO START TO SPRINGBOARD THINGS ON. AND WITHIN ALL THE LAYERS THAT THAT WE CAN DO THAT I COULD PROBABLY TALK FOR FOUR DAYS ON INTERNAL THINGS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT. BUT LET’S FOCUS TODAY ON THE COMMON GROUND OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BUILD UP FROM THAT. AND IF THERE’S ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THAT I’LL STEP ASIDE. I JUST WANTED TO BRING UP TO THAT. NO, WE ALL AGREE. I DON’T THINK THERE’S ANY POLICE OFFICER IN OMAHA. THAT DOESN’T FEEL LIKE THERE SHOULD BE JUSTICE BUT DEMONSTRATING AND DESTROYING PUBLIC PROPERTY AND OMAHA. NEBRASKA IS NOT GOING TO BRING JUSTICE. DID GEORGE FLOYD THAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN UP IN MINNEAPOLIS MINNESOTA, BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT SINCE I HAVE BEEN MARRIED ALMOST SEVEN YEARS NOW. I HAVE SEEN THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT CHIEF SCHMADERER IN HIS COMMAND STAFF. THEY’RE STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY MAKE REMARKABLE PROGRESS ON COMMUNITY-POLICE RELATIONS. THEY HAVE WORKED VERY HARD ON IT. THEY BELIEVED IN COMMUNITY POLICING THEY ARE OUT THERE WORKING AND ENGAGING THE PUBLIC ALL OF THE TIME. I THINK WE’VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS. I’M AND EARLIER THE DEATH OF CARRIER. RASCA OROSCO IT BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER IN OMAHA. NOT JUST THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, BUT THE ENTIRE CITY THERE WAS GOOD THAT CAME OUT OF THAT TRAGEDY AND EVERYBODY IN OMAHA FOR A WHILE WAS WEARING THE SUPPORT BLUE T-SHIRTS. SO GENERALLY I FEEL LIKE THE WORK THEY’VE ALREADY DONE HAS REALLY IMPROVED POLICE-COMMUNITY RELATIONS. WE CAN ALWAYS IMPROVE BUT GENERALLY THE PEOPLE IN OMAHA RESPECT THE JOB THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT DOES I MENTIONED THIS THE OTHER DAY WE VERY FEW ARE COMPLAINTS THAT COME TO US FOR EXCESSIVE FORCE. GENERALLY. THERE’S A LOT OF SUPPORT AND A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT. THAT’S WHY IT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THIS VIOLENCE IS NOT COMING FROM FELLOW OMAHA’S THAT A LOT OF THIS VIOLENCE IS BEING IN CITED BY OTHERS WHO JUST WANT TO HAVE A VOICE BUT HAVING A VOICE IN VIOLENCE IS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. SO WE ARE WE’RE ALL LISTENING AND WE UNDERSTAND AND WE ALL AGREE AND WE ALL FEEL THE SAME WAY THERE. TO BE JUSTICE AND WE FEEL WHAT HAPPENED IN MINNESOTA WAS TERRIBLE, BUT JUSTICE IS NOT VIOLENCE IN THE CITY OF OMAHA, AND WE’VE GOT TO MOVE FORWARD AND WE’VE GOT TO UNITE TOGETHER AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER. WE WILL ALWAYS ALWAYS STRIVE TO BE BETTER. IF ANYBODY SAYS WE’RE AS GOOD AS WE CAN BE THE FIRST ONE TO SAY WERE WRONG, BUT WE WILL ALWAYS STRIVE TO BE BETTER, BUT I THINK THAT THEY HAVE MADE REMARKABLE PROGRESS AND I WANT TO SEE THAT PROGRESS CONTINUE. DOCTOR THANK YOU. ALSO MICHELLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE’VE BEEN DOING IN MY ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO REACHING OUT TO LEADERS IN NORTH AND SOUTH OMAHA. OBVIOUSLY BEEN WORKING WITH REGARD TO THIS PANDEMIC. WE’VE HAD CONVERSATIONS THOUGH ALSO ABOUT DIRECTOR FRAKES HAVING PHONE CALLS WITH TIME VANDANA CAN’T DO A MEET IN PERSON MEETINGS. BUT WITH NORTH OMAHA LEADERS, AND I’D REFER FOLKS TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE PLANNING ON WORKING ON TO THE PRESS RELEASE. WE PUT OUT OVER A WEEK AGO WITH REGARD TO SOME OF THE STEPS. NOT ONLY ADDRESS THE PANDEMIC ISSUES IN NORTH AND SOUTH OMAHA, BUT ALSO WORK ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUES TO BE ABLE TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE IN NORTH AND SOUTH OMAHA. SO THESE ARE THE TYPES OF STEPS THAT WE GOT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS. I JUST ECHO WHAT THE MAYOR SAID THE VIOLENCE IS NOT PUSHING THOSE THINGS FOR WE UNDERSTAND PEOPLE’S CONCERNS AND WE KNOW WE GOT TO DO MORE WE GOT TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE BUT THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER. IN FACT, I THINK IT JUST REALLY JUST WORKS THE OPPOSITE JUST REALLY KIND OF DENIGRATES THE MEMORY OF GEORGE FLOYD WHAT I DON’T THINK HE WOULD HAVE WON. SO HE WOULD HAVE WANTED US TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY MORE RELATING BETTER RELATIONSHIPS TO BE ABLE TO HELP FOLKS WITH HIS IPHONE. MONA I’M GOING TO WITH CHICK WASIKOWSKA FROM CHANNEL 3. WELL, HE WASN’T RELEASED ONCE HE WAS DETAINED. HE’S BEEN IN OUR CUSTODY EVER SINCE. TOM BECC THANK YOU. CHIEF VIDEO OF THE SHOOTING LAST NIGHT. TOM LET ME SAY THIS I’VE BEEN A PRIZE THAT THERE’S SOME VIDEO I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THE LOGISTICS OF THE THE ECOSYSTEM THAT’S PLAYING OUT RIGHT NOW, SO I HAVEN’T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DIVE DEEPLY INTO THAT THE COUNTY ATTORNEY IS INDICATED TO ME THAT HE’LL HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE WHEN HE MAKES HIS DECISION THAT AND THE DECISION TO BOOK OR WE’LL COME FROM THE COUNTY ATTORNEY’S POSITION, BUT HE’S CURRENTLY IN CUSTODY THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT. WE’RE VERY FORTUNATE THAT WE’RE GOING TO BE RECEIVING MILITARY POLICE. THEY’LL HAVE THEY’LL HAVE THAT EXTRA TRAINING AND THAT MILITARY POLICE BACKGROUND WHICH WOULD BE WHICH IS OUR BEST CASE SCENARIO WHEN IN AND WORKING WITH US. SO THEY’LL BE ARMED AND EVERYTHING JUST LIKE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. CHRIS I CAN TREAT THE INDIVIDUAL FROM OUT-OF-STATE ARRESTED WITH THE BALL TOP COCKTAIL. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT STATE? HE’S FROM COUNT THINGS IOWA COUNCIL BLUFFS, MAYBE. NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE ON THAT, BUT WE’LL GET TO THE PACKET OF WE’RE ALL THAT’S FROM YET ANOTHER QUESTION. YOU’RE WELCOME. CONCERNING THE MURDER LAST NIGHT FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGH WELL I’M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE MURDER INVESTIGATION. OKAY, THEY THE INFRACTIONS THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PANDEMIC. FRACTIONS ARE MAIN THING TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW. LIKE I SAID THE CHARGING DECISION. IT IS THAT COMES FROM THE COUNTY ATTORNEY. I’M THE CHIEF OF POLICE. YOU MAKE THE DETAINMENT COUNTY ATTORNEY MAKES THE CHARGING DECISION. THAT’S THAT’S HOW THAT THAT’S HOW THAT WORKS. OKAY. SO I’M BRIAN MASTER. BRIAN HAVEN’T HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO ANYBODY’S FAMILY AND YOU HEARD ME EARLIER SAY THAT I HAVEN’T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE OF THE ECOSYSTEM OF EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH TO DIVE INTO THAT PARTICULAR CASE CASE TO TO AN INFINITE LEVEL. YOUR TICKET ONE OR TWO MORE QUESTIONS. YES, SIR. WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE? IF PROPERTY OWNERS FEEL THAT THEY NEED TO DO AN EXTRA LEVEL OF PROTECTION A LOT OF THE BUSINESSES ALONG 72ND STREET HAVE ELECTED TO PUT PLYWOOD ON FRONT OF THEIR WINDOWS THINGS LIKE THAT REALIZE THAT WE’VE TAKEN GREAT EXTRA MEASURES AS A CITY HERE TODAY TO TRY TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY’S PROPERTY AND SAFETY IS SECURE. SO THOSE ARE A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING DONE. I DO NOT CONDONE ANY VIGILANTE ACTIONS IF THAT’S THE NATURE OF IN THE PREMISE BEHIND YOUR QUESTION. I DO NOT CONDONE THAT AT ALL. THAT’S THAT’S WHERE IT’S GOING AND I’M NOT SURE IF IT WAS APOLOGIZE IF I HAD LIVED TOO MUCH. LET’S DO. ST. COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS, SO I’M GOING TO GO TO RICK ROUBLES ON MY WORLD HERALD THEN I’LL GO TO YOU ROGER. PLEASE MAN, YOU SAID THAT? AREA OKAY, YEAH. THANK YOU, BROTHER. ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE WAY? HAS OUTSIDE INFLUENCE YOU’RE MOVING FORWARD TO BRINGING THE FIRST OF ALL, I AM PROUD OF YOU MOM POLICE DEPARTMENT. THEY HAVE PERFORMED VERY WELL IN A A VERY EXTREMELY HARD CIRCUMSTANCES. I ASKED ANYBODY THAT SITS BACK AND WANTS TO MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK EVERYTHING. IMAGINE IF YOU HAD TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATIONS THAT WE’VE DEALT WITH IN THE CITY FOR THE LAST COUPLE DAYS, WE’VE HANDLED IT AS BEST WE COULD. AS PROFE",0.0

The peaceful protest started at 11 a.m. Sunday outside the Hastings Police Department. Around a dozen people lined the sidewalk along Burlington Avenue chanting and holding signs that read ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""I Can't Breathe."" Tanya Pedersen, the protest organizer, said their goal is to end racism and police brutality. This is personal for her and her family, which is why they joined the national act to spark change. ""Being a mixed person in this small town, we've seen a lot of racism,"" Pedersen said. ""So it's very important for people to know that we're all the same, and we all bleed the same."" Pedersen said members of her family have experienced bullying due to the color of their skin. Her daughter, Emma Henry, is one of them. ""Going to Hastings High School, I feel like there's a lot of people who discriminate against me there as well,"" Henry said. ""And going into stores, especially in a smaller town since there are not a lot of people of color here, you still get discriminated against."" Henry was also at the protest Sunday. She held a sign that read ""Say Their Names,"" and detailed some of her experiences with racism. Hastings joins a number of cities who have seen protests all across the country following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. Videos circulated on Monday of a police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck as he repeatedly said he couldn't breathe. That officer was fired, arrested and charged with Third Degree Murder and Manslaughter on Friday.",0.0

Eventually, Siebe said, Lehmkuhl joined them with a fire extinguisher. Packett said the trio put out about 10 fires, which grew larger and larger as the night went on. They ran back and forth again and again, searching through the buildings for more fires, Siebe said. The tear gas stung their eyes, and Lehmkuhl said he was hit with a rubber bullet. Then, Siebe said, law enforcement moving down Lincoln Mall stopped them, told them to put their hands up and get on the ground. ""All I remember is thinking 'Man, I really hope I don't get shot,'"" Siebe said. All three were cuffed and taken to a squad car, Packett said, even as others in the crowd yelled to officers that the young men were helping.

Police custody. The rage out there is predictable. It's understandable, and it's legitimate. Unfortunately, it's being expressed right now over the past week in ways that are destructive. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, praise those who kept their protests peaceful. The raw emotions were on display, and, as I said yesterday, the beautiful expression of solidarity in community that we saw played out by peaceful protestors demonstrations elsewhere Saturday also began peacefully, right. More than two dozen cities nationwide had nighttime curfews in place, and protesters came out anyway, in some cases descending into chaos and destruction.

It's unclear if First Lady Melania Trump and Barron Trump were also taken down with him.Trump has repeatedly praised the Secret Service for its handling of the protests outside the White House Friday night in the wake of George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis.The New York Times first reported Trump was taken to the bunker.The decision to physically move the president came as protesters confronted Secret Service officers outside the White House for hours on Friday — shouting, throwing water bottles and other objects at the line of officers, and attempting to break through the metal barriers.At times, the crowd would remove the metal barriers and begin pushing up against the officers and their riot shields. The Secret Service continually replaced the barriers throughout the night as protesters wrestled them away.Protesters pushed hard enough a few times that officers had to walk away with what appeared to be minor injuries. At one point, the agents responded to aggressive pushing and yelling by using pepper spray on the protesters.Throughout the night, protesters could be heard chanting their support for Floyd, an unarmed black man who died last week after being pinned down by a white police officer, and their dislike of Trump. The protest, which began around 10 p.m. ET, Friday night outside the White House, had mostly quieted down by 3:30 a.m. ET, Saturday morning.The crowd thinned out and Secret Service officers were able to expand their perimeter and barriers around Lafayette Park across from the White House.Six arrests were made during the protests, the Secret Service confirmed in a statement Saturday afternoon.The president on Thursday had used the threat of police retaliation and military intervention in Minnesota where protests turned violent and destructive — saying on Twitter that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""Trump's tweets on Saturday also invoked imagery tied to brutal civil rights-era police tactics.Now, a serious divide has emerged among the President's top allies and advisers over how the president should address several nights of protests and riots.Trump is being urged by some advisers to formally address the nation and call for calm, while others have said he should condemn the rioting and looting more forcefully or risk losing middle-of-the-road voters in November, according to several sources familiar with the deliberations.",0.0

In this July 17, 2019, file photo, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms speaks during a Senate Democrats' Special Committee on the Climate Crisis on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Source: AP Photo/Andrew Harnik/AP) Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a news conference that she and police Chief Erika Shields made the decision after reviewing body-camera footage of a Saturday night incident that first gained attention from video online and on local news. ""Use of excessive force is never acceptable,"" Bottoms told reporters. Shields called the footage ""really shocking to watch."" Police on Sunday night identified the fired officers as Investigator Ivory Streeter, who was hired in December 2003, and Investigator Mark Gardner, who was hired in August 1997. Bottoms said the woman, Taniyah Pilgrim, was released without charges. She said the man, Messiah Young, was released, too, and she's ordering the charges against him dropped. She didn't specify what charges he faced. A police report says Young was charged with attempting to elude police and driving with a suspended license. Dramatic body camera video that police released Sunday night shows police taking another young man into custody in a downtown street alongside a line of stopped cars. The man is pleading with police to let him go, saying he didn't do anything. Young, sitting in the driver's seat of a car stopped in the street holds up his phone, appearing to shoot video as an officer approaches and pulls the driver's side door open. Young pulls the door shut and says repeatedly, ""I'm not dying today."" He urges the officers to release the other man and let him get in the car as the dark sedan advances a bit. The car gets stuck in traffic and officers run up to both sides of the car shouting orders. An officer uses a stun gun on Pilgrim as she's trying to get out of the car and then officers pull her from the vehicle. Another officer yells at Young to put the car in park and open the window. An officer repeatedly hits the driver's side window with a baton, and another officer finally manages to break it. As the glass shatters, an officer uses a stun gun on Young and officers pull him from the car as officers shout, ""Get your hand out of your pockets,"" and, ""He got a gun. He got a gun. He got a gun."" Once he's out of the car and on the ground, officers zip tie Young's hands behind his back and lead him away. Police reports do not list a gun as having been recovered. The mayor said she had delayed the news conference several hours to review all the body-camera footage because she and Shields wanted to be certain about what happened. ""I really wanted to believe that the body-worn camera footage would provide some larger view that could better rationalize why we got to this space,"" Shields said. ""And having spent most of the afternoon with the mayor, reviewing the footage exhaustively, I knew that I had only one option, and that is to terminate the employees."" Bottoms said she had spoken to leaders at Spelman College and Morehouse College, where she said the the young people were students. She said she'd also spoken to representatives for the students but hadn't yet spoken directly to them. Shields offered an apology and said she knows the officers' behavior was unacceptable and caused further fear. ""Sometimes the best thing, the only thing you can do as a police chief is come in and clean up the mess that's before you,"" Shields said. ""When wrong is wrong, we have to, as law enforcement, start dealing with it in the same manner that we would deal with it with non-law enforcement,"" Shields said. ""For some reason, we've fallen into a gray area where there's a separate set of rules for law enforcement, and if we want to get out of this space that we're in now we have to change how we manage internally."" Shields said she experienced a broad range of emotions as just a few hours before she saw the video, another of her officers was seriously injured. A preliminary investigation indicates the officer was in an intersection on foot to block traffic from passing into an area where there were protesters when a person on an ATV approached at a high rate of speed and hit him. Officer Maximilian Brewer suffered significant injuries to his legs and remained in the intensive care unit Sunday evening, Shields said, adding that she hopes he'll be able to walk again. The ATV rider was taken into custody at the scene and to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police on Sunday night identified the driver of the ATV as 42-year-old Avery Goggans. He has been charged with DUI, serious injury by vehicle, reckless driving, possession of marijuana and several other traffic charges, police Sgt. John Chafee said in an email. Bottoms imposed a 9 p.m. curfew for Saturday and Sunday. Gov. Brian Kemp authorized up to 3,000 National Guard troops to be deployed in cities across the state to respond if needed to protests over the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in coastal Georgia. Atlanta police said Sunday they had arrested more than 150 people as protesters threw rocks at officers and broke windows in the downtown area. The curfew was initially imposed after demonstrations Friday night turned violent with people setting fires and smashing windows at businesses and restaurants. Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Protestors demonstrate on University Avenue while holding a ""WE CAN'T BREATHE"" sign and wearing protective masks, Thursday, May 28, 2020, in St. Paul, Minn. Protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody Monday, broke out in Minneapolis for a third straight night. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) Georgia's governor declared a state of emergency in one county to activate up to 500 members of the state National Guard ""to protect people & property in Atlanta."" Gov. Brian Kemp said in a pair of tweets early Saturday that the move came at the request of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and in consultation with emergency officials. The Georgia National Guard will deploy ""immediately"" to assist law enforcement, he said. In Minneapolis, where a police precinct was burned the night before, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring an 8 p.m. curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. As a pair of restaurants and a Wells Fargo branch were set ablaze, a heavy contingent of National Guard, state troopers and police moved in, some on foot and some in vehicles. In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: ""He said I can't breathe. Justice for George."" They chanted """"No justice, no peace"" and ""Say his name. George Floyd."" One person was killed in downtown Detroit after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters, a Detroit police spokeswoman said Saturday. The shooting occurred about 11:30 p.m. Friday near Detroit’s Greektown entertainment district as officers were confronted with dozens of protesters, said Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood, a police department spokeswoman. She said an officer wasn’t involved in the shooting. Kirkwood said the victim was a 19-year-old man, who was pronounced dead at the hospital. After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting ""Quit your jobs."" At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: ""This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr."" ""You are disgracing our city,"" she told protesters. ""You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home."" Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King's daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. ""We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?"" he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. Protesters gathered outside the White House, with President Donald Trump inside, and some tried to push through barriers set up by the U.S. Secret Service along Pennsylvania Avenue. An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City spiraled into chaos as night fell, as protesters skirmished with officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the largely diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter another police vehicle. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to carry off those they arrested. ""We have a long night ahead of us in Brooklyn,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted. ""Our sole focus is deescalating this situation and getting people home safe. There will be a full review of what happened tonight. We don't ever want to see another night like this."" The police department said numerous officers were injured, including one who had a tooth knocked out. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. ""It's my duty to be out here,"" said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. ""Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we're going to be heard."" In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Among them was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. ""My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we're not oppressed."" Tensions rose in several West Coast cities as night fell and protesters blocked highways in Los Angeles and Oakland. About 1,000 protesters gathered in Oakland. They smashed windows, sprayed buildings with ""Kill Cops"" graffiti and were met with chemical spray from police. Oakland Police were notifying a crowd that the demonstrationwas an unlawful assembly. Authorities said officers were injured when projectiles were thrown and that they were asking people to leave the area. Demonstrators in Los Angeles scuffled at times with police, with a few protesters detained and one officer receiving medical treatment, police said. An LAPD vehicle had its windows smashed, and CNN reported that someone wrote ""killer"" on a patrol car. Protesters repeatedly clashed with police in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose, said Mayor Sam Liccardo, and police responded with flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets. One officer was being treated at a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, he and police officials said. Liccardo said his own officers shared the community's outrage over Floyd's in-custody death. ""It was a horrible injustice. I'd venture to guess that every police officer out there feels much of the same anger about what happened in Minneapolis,"" he told The Associated Press. Thirty miles to the west, Santa Cruz police chief Andrew G. Mills said in a statement that the actions by Minneapolis officers in Floyd’s death “are the antithesis of what we view as good policing.” Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

Omaha police are investigating the death of James Scurlock, a 22-year-old protester. The shooting occurred at about 11 p.m. Saturday in the city's Old Market area and within a couple of blocks of where protesters had gathered.

Authorities would not release the shooter's name, but the World-Herald confirmed it was Jake Gardner, who owns The Hive. Hours before the Saturday night shooting, Gardner posted on Facebook about protecting his business. ""Just when you think 'what else could 2020 throw at me?'

Joe Biden quietly visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. On Monday, he'll meet with community leaders in Wilmington. That low-key, high-touch approach may be a sign of how the presumptive Democratic nominee presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by the much louder, more persistent voice of Trump. On one of the most profound weekends the nation has seen, with violence in dozens of cities, Biden was out of wide public view. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.” Reassurance requires presence, though, and that has been a hurdle for the former vice president, driven inside by the coronavirus pandemic, still working to adapt to the power of social media as a substitute and without the natural platform of a public office. Demings suggested the campaign will be doing more soon. Biden released a criminal justice reform plan last July, but has not issued an updated or more specific proposal since then. In early May, he released his “Plan for Black America,” an economic- and education-focused agenda that included marijuana decriminalization. The congresswoman said she planned to work with other members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill to try to help craft reforms, though she would not confirm or deny any conversations she had with the Biden campaign about the push. “What I have done is offer my service to the campaign and, and anyone else, to look at what we can do working together moving forward. And so we’ll see. We have a lot of work to do,” she said. “We’re going to discuss ideas and make recommendations.” Demings said she would push for a major Justice Department review of law enforcement agencies throughout the country, and said she saw a role for the federal government in implementing standard policies that govern hiring, training, retention and pay and benefits for law enforcement officers. So far, however, Democrats are banking that time and the nation's political mood are on their side. They note that while Biden didn't appear on television all weekend, he spoke about Floyd's death before Trump addressed it and has shown compassion for the protesters. Trump has alternated between expressing alarm over Floyd's death and sympathy for his family and issuing tweets antagonizing protesters and disparaging his political enemies. Some Biden aides who aren't authorized to discuss strategy privately say the campaign thinks the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden in the past for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. “I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That’s not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.” Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

One of the drummers accompanying him held a sign with the name Zachary Bear Heels, who died after an altercation with Omaha police in 2017. Patty Pansing-Brooks, a state senator from Lincoln, said she came to show support. “I just want people to know we are listening. We need to have people come to us and tell us what to do,” she said. “We have got to say ‘We have your backs and we’re going to stand up and fight for you. We want to fight with you. We want to learn from you.'” Rob Taylor of Lincoln spoke, taking his race to task, saying white people have been the problem for 400 years. He urged the crowd to “take it to Congress, take it to the voting booth.” Rachael Farris, a Lincoln East student, said she was from Mississippi, a place that doesn’t care if you’re black and hurt. “You can’t do this with violence,” she said. “Do not give them a reason, please.”",0.0

Omaha police are investigating the death of James Scurlock, a 22-year-old protester. The shooting occurred at about 11 p.m. Saturday in the city's Old Market area and within a couple of blocks of where protesters had gathered. Police said they arrested someone within the hour in connection with the shooting. Scurlock was shot outside an Old Market bar called The Hive, near 12th and Harney streets. Authorities would not release the shooter's name, but the World-Herald confirmed it was Jake Gardner, who owns The Hive. Hours before the Saturday night shooting, Gardner posted on Facebook about protecting his business. ""Just when you think 'what else could 2020 throw at me?' Then you have to pull 48 hours of military style firewatch,"" he posted. Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine said he hoped to make a determination soon on whether to file charges.",0.0

""As a white woman I know that I will never know the struggle of my fellow black and brown friends but I can say, I empathize and can be here,"" said Ryan. ""I will stand up with you.

I want my grandson to grow up in a world where color doesn't matter. If somebody all of a sudden decided blonde hair and blue eyes were bad, my grandson would be toast."" They stood in front of The Mona with signs in their hands, chanting ""black lives matter"" and ""stop police brutality."" Some cars honked their horns in solidarity to the protest. After an hour at the museum, they took to the streets. They marched down the intersection of 2nd and 25th in Kearney, and stopped at corners to further spread their message to people driving by. Kevin Queen, an organizer said, ""We can make an impact without destroying people's businesses and livelihoods."" The protest lasted for several hours, with their signs in hand and said repeatedly by one of the protesters, ""all lives matter, but today black lives we remember.""

Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Louisville, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds. More than 17,000 National Guard troops have been activated in states across the U.S. due to civil unrest as of Monday, and that number is expected to grow. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody last Monday. Video shows that a Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes shortly before his death. Tensions were already simmering following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was jogging through a Glynn County, Ga., neighborhood when he was shot dead. Three white men were arrested last month after state investigators took over the case from local authorities. Protests also continued for a fourth straight night in Louisville, Ky., as activists called for justice for Taylor. Police shot and killed the 26-year-old black woman in her home. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitrailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown that had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed, northbound on Interstate 35W. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. ""It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn't appear to drive through any barricades,"" the department tweeted. Some protesters jumped on top of the truck, and as it stopped, they dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. ""He was driving a gas tanker,"" said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. ""He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful."" State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so that the protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest had appeared peaceful. Tensions flare in the nation's capital Washington, D.C., authorities imposed a curfew after an evening of escalating demonstrations. Protesters threw bottles at police and set fires to cars and the basement of historic St. John's Church, which has been visited by every president since James Madison. ""Tonight's curfew will begin at 7 p.m. and will run for two days,"" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a late morning news conference on Monday. It's primary day in the nation's capital on Tuesday, and the curfew goes into effect an hour before polls close at 8 p.m., according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections website. The protests on Sunday began with peaceful marchers, along with a police escort, moving their way along a nearly 2-mile stretch from Howard University to Lafayette Square in front of the White House. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd and other African Americans who have died following police violence. ""Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,"" read a sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. ""It's crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,"" she said. ""We are at a point where it's the same story, the same things are happening. I'm tired of this."" But after clashes with law enforcement and the fires erupting, police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Kentucky authorities investigate shooting death in Louisville Kentucky's governor said that one person died early Monday as security forces confronted a crowd in central Louisville. ""While working to disperse a crowd, [Louisville Metro Police Department] and the Kentucky National Guard were fired upon,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. ""LMPD and the Kentucky National Guard returned fire resulting in a death."" He announced that the Kentucky State Police will be investigating the matter. Statement from Governor Andy Beshear: pic.twitter.com/MyHxcE3Ntn — Governor Andy Beshear (@GovAndyBeshear) June 1, 2020 Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted his ""deepest condolences"" for the family of the man, whom he identified as David McAtee. Fischer also called for a Day of Reflection on Monday. He held a late morning virtual gathering on Facebook with faith leaders after another night of demonstrations in the city over the death of Breonna Taylor. On Sunday, law enforcement officers earlier fired tear gas into a crowd assembled in the Jefferson Square area of the city, NPR member station WFPL reported. At a Sunday evening news conference, Fischer again thanked those protesting peacefully but said others were ""hijacking"" their efforts. Tomorrow, Monday, June 1, 2020 I am declaring a Day of Reflection in our city. We will have a virtual gathering at 11:30 a.m. Monday on Facebook with local faith leaders. We’ll be talking about the events of the last few days & acknowledging the pain we’ve all felt. 2/2 — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) June 1, 2020 Atlanta officers terminated for excessive force Two Atlanta police officers have been terminated and three others placed on desk duty after a video of the arrest of two young African Americans leaving the protests Saturday night went viral. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the officers' firing on Sunday, saying the footage ""was disturbing on many levels."" ""We understand our officers are working very long hours, under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that veteran officers Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter were terminated. The footage from Streeter's body camera shows the officers confronting the pair as the two were leaving the downtown protests after the 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. At roughly the 2:30 mark in the video, one of them is seen sitting in the driver's seat of a car, recording officers arresting someone else. An officer opens the car door and asks the driver if he wants to go to jail. Several minutes later, officers approach the car again. One uses a baton to smash the driver's side window. Police then use a stun gun on the driver, who has been identified by local media as Messiah Young. Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that Young suffered an epileptic seizure, according to Spelman College's Student Government Association. The second person, a woman who has since been identified as Taniyah Pilgrim, has been released from custody and charges against her dropped. Footage posted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows the passenger pleading with police to stop as they also use a stun gun against her. ''They haven't heard us"": Protests escalate in Southern California Vandalism and violence broke out after peaceful protests in Santa Monica and other parts of Southern California on Sunday — a sequence of events that has become familiar in many U.S. cities in the past week. The new round of destruction came despite a curfew and the presence of the National Guard. ""We tried kneeling,"" protester Jesus Guzman, 19, told NPR's Doualy Xaykaothao near the Santa Monica Pier. ""We tried putting on those T-shirts that said 'I can't breathe.' We tried those hashtags. We tried doing it all peacefully, but they haven't heard us — they haven't done nothing."" ""The violence, for him, is justified,"" Xaykaothao reported. With store windows smashed, some shop owners in Santa Monica started cleaning up the mess overnight — the latest setback after weeks of forced closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At their hair salon, Martha Padilla-Bruni and her family were sweeping up broken glass under the streetlights. ""I'm in shock. I don't know what's going to happen,"" Padilla-Bruni told NPR's Nathan Rott. Her son, Joe Franco, said he supports the protesters and those who were there earlier in the day. He said he understands that people are in pain. Franco said, ""But I was here across the street, and what I saw, the people that were doing this ... they were not here to protest. They were here to cause trouble."" Reporter in Long Beach, Calif., hit in throat by rubber bullet KPCC/LAist reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez was hit in the throat by a rubber bullet Sunday evening during protests in Long Beach, Calif. He believes the bullet was fired by Long Beach police, who had been firing the projectiles nearby. ""I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat,"" Guzman-Lopez said via Twitter, posting an image of his wound. ""I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street.""

The reporter said he had just finished interviewing a man who had been kneeling in protest when he himself was hit. ""I talked to him for about a minute, and just as I was finishing talking to him — right after I said, 'Thank you' — I heard a pop and I felt something, you know, the bottom of my throat, and I saw something bounced onto the ground, and then I ran,"" he said. ""As I was running, I did start to feel its sting, and then I put my fingers to my throat and there was blood on my fingers."" A number of journalists have been hit with police projectiles during the protests, including MSNBC's Ali Velshi, who was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet in Minneapolis, and a Louisville TV reporter who was shot with pepper balls.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 60,000 cases of coronavirus illness among nursing home residents, according to a copy of the letter addressed to the governors and an accompanying chart provided to The Associated Press. The data was based on reports received from about 80% of the nation’s 15,400 nursing homes as of May 24. But some states with high rates of nursing home deaths appeared to have some of the lowest levels of response to the federal data-gathering survey, intended as a first step toward developing policy changes. “This data, and anecdotal reports across the country, clearly show that nursing homes have been devastated by the virus,” wrote CDC Director Robert Redfield and CMS Administrator Seema Verma. The U.S. has seen over 104,000 deaths and nearly 1.8 million infections in the pandemic, both count’s the highest in the world. And although the first wave of the pandemic may be easing in much of the U.S., that doesn’t mean nursing homes are in any less danger: Experts say in a virus rebound they can again become the stage for tragic scenes of death and despair, as well as a risk for the broader community. “What is going on in a nursing home can be a barometer for where the virus is,” said Tamara Konetzka, a research professor at the University of Chicago, who specializes in long-term care issues. As tourist destination worldwide reopened for business, new rules were in place to guard against the virus' spread. The Florida Keys welcomed visitors for the first time in two months, the Colosseum opened its ancient doors in Rome, ferries restarted in Bangladesh and golfers played in Greece. But even as the tourist-dependent Keys took down barriers to allow visitors, Miami-Dade County kept its beaches closed because of protests in South Florida and across the country over the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man pinned at the neck by a white police officer in Minneapolis. Roadblocks were taken down shortly after midnight near Key Largo, the northernmost island in the Florida chain, where almost half of all workers are employed by hotels, bars and other hospitality industries, and many of the rest are involved in commercial and sport fishing. Richard Stanczyk, owner of Bud N’ Mary’s marina in Islamorada, said the 40 captains who operate fishing boats out of the 76-year-old business have had virtually no customers for weeks and welcomed the reopening. “There has been a real uptick in phone calls. There have been more charter bookings,” Stanczyk said. “We are encouraged. It’s going to come back.” Yet the carefree, party atmosphere that surrounds the Keys and was popularized by singer Jimmy Buffet in songs like “Margaritaville” may not return for some time. The Monroe County Tourist Development Council made clear on its website that visitors must adhere to health guidelines. “Bring facial coverings, gloves, hand sanitizer, reef-safe sunscreen and personal essential medicines. If you’re feeling unwell, please stay home,” it said. Countries around the Mediterranean Sea also tentatively kicked off a summer season where tourists could bask in their famously sunny beaches with distancing measures in place. “We are reopening a symbol. A symbol of Rome, a symbol for Italy,” said Alfonsina Russo, director of the Colosseum’s archaeological park. “(We are) restarting in a positive way, with a different pace, with a more sustainable tourism.” Greece lifted lockdown measures for hotels, campsites, open-air cinemas, golf courses and public swimming pools, while b eaches and museums reopened in Turkey and bars, restaurants, cinemas and museums came back to life in the Netherlands. “Today, we opened two rooms and tomorrow three. It’s like building an anthill,” Athens hotel owner Panos Betis said as employees wearing face masks tidied a rooftop restaurant and cleaned a window facing the ancient Acropolis. “Our aim now is to hang in there until 2021."" A long line of masked visitors snaked outside the Vatican Museums, which include the Sistine Chapel, as they reopened for the first time in three months. The Vatican Museums’ famous keyholder — the “clavigero” who holds the keys to all the galleries on a big ring on his wrist — opened the gate in a sign both symbolic and literal that the Museums were back in business. Still, strict crowd control measures were in place: Visitors needed reservations, their temperatures were taken before entering and masks were mandatory. The Dutch relaxation of coronavirus rules took place on a major holiday with the sun blazing, raising fears of overcrowding in popular beach resorts. The new rules let bars and restaurants serve up to 30 people inside if they keep social distancing, but there was no standing at bars and reservations were necessary. Britain, which has the world's second-worst death toll behind the United States, eased restrictions despite warnings from health officials that the risk of spreading COVID-19 was still too great. Some elementary classes reopened and people could have limited contact with family and friends, but only outdoors and with social distancing. Around 6.19 million infections have been reported worldwide, with over 372,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many died without ever being tested. In the U.S., the often-violent protests over Floyd's death raised fears of new outbreaks in a country where the pandemic has disproportionately affected racial minorities. Protests have shaken cities from New York to Los Angeles, with d emonstrators packed cheek by jowl, many without masks, shouting or singing. The virus is spread by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, talk or sing. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo expressed concern Monday the protests in New York City could imperil the long, hard fight to contain the pandemic in a worldwide hot spot. “You turn on the TV and you see these mass gatherings that could potentially be infecting hundreds and hundreds of people after everything that we have done,” Cuomo said. “We have to take a minute and ask ourselves: ’What are we doing here?” ___ Anderson reported from St. Petersburg, Florida.

Between hugs and comforting hands placed on her back, she mourned the loss of her friend James “JuJu” Scurlock who died a few feet away near the corner of 12th and Harney streets last night in a shooting as the city experienced its second night of violent protests. Davis said she’d know the 22-year-old Scurlock for five years and that the two bonded when his family took Davis in when she was homeless. He and his family were the only reason she graduated from Benson High School, she said. Now she just wants people to remember his name. Remember the goofy, caring person who left behind a large family, loyal friends and a 4-month-old daughter who hasn’t even started to crawl yet, Davis said. “He was there for me at my lowest,” Davis said, “and now I need to be there for him.” Advertisement A memorial fund has been started for Scurlock. Today police said the suspect, who was arrested at 11:27 p.m., is still in custody. No charges have been filed yet but Omaha Chief of Police Todd Schmaderer said that the crime was being investigated as a murder and the Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine will be making a charging decision at an upcoming press conference. Mayor Jean Stothert announced the city would enact a 72-hour state of emergency and curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. starting Sunday night and Scurlock was allegedly shot by the owner of a prominent downtown business in an altercation caught on video. Omaha police have not released the suspect’s name but he’s been widely identified on social media as Jake Gardner, the owner of The Hive and The Gatsby bars in the Old Market. A defense fund was started in Gardner’s name on GoFundMe, however, it seems to have been deleted by the time of this article’s publishing. The video footage from late last night shows a small crowd outside of what appears to be The Hive near 12th and Harney streets in the Old Market. Advertisement “This n***a got a gun, bro,” the person behind the camera says as several men stand around each other. “This n***a got a gun. It’s not worth it.” Suddenly one person appears to jump on another person’s back. After a few seconds of struggle, there’s two loud bangs. The person filming turns the camera on himself and runs away. This morning, photos outside The Hive showed several windows were shattered. In a post on his Facebook account made hours before the shooting, Jake Gardner wrote, “Just when you think ‘ what else could 2020 throw at me?’ Then you have to pull 48 hours of military style firewatch.” Omaha police tweeted they had a suspect in custody at 11:27 p.m. Suspect is in custody. https://t.co/ntoZUUQ3Di — Omaha Police Dept (@OmahaPolice) May 31, 2020 The protest downtown followed gatherings at 72nd and Dodge both Friday and Saturday night where police deployed tear gas and pepper bullets on protesters. Omaha Chief of Police Todd Schmaderer has stated that a few individuals in the otherwise peaceful crowd prompted the response after police were threatened. The shooting occurred as protesters moved through downtown last night. Community leaders in attendance expressed outrage on social media when individuals, universally described as white males, began breaking windows and spray painting graffiti. Early the next morning hundreds of volunteers gathered in the Old Market to help business owners scrub off the paint, clean up the broken glass and board up windows. A family member of at least one business posted that damage can be repaired, but lives, like Scurlock’s, will not return. Under the hot sun, Davis stood with a white bandana tied around her hair and a tattoo across her right collarbone that read, “In the pain comes strength.” As the curfew is enacted, Davis said she’s not going anywhere. But she wants fellow protesters speaking out about police brutality and government indifference to stop the violence. “If we stand together as the people,” she said, “we have a voice.”",0.0

A volunteer from the neighborhood walks out onto Lake Street. ""Is this your business?"" she asks. Safia and her daughter Saida Hassan nod silently. ""I'm sorry,"" the woman says. It's the first time they've seen it since fiery protests erupted among cries for racial justice and as state troopers in riot gear blocked the road to this street. The walls are charred black, the kitchen reduced to rubble. Glass and water are swimming in puddles as community members around them work to sweep away the destruction. Safia looks around stunned. Hers is one of hundreds of businesses damaged or destroyed in protests on Thursday and Friday night. ""Alhamdulillah,"" she repeats quietly. Praise God. ""Everyone is safe."" ""My heart is broken. My mind is broken,"" she says. ""I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice."" George Floyd is the African American man who died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee for several minutes last Monday. Protests started in Minneapolis early last week and quickly spread across the country. Floyd's pleading words to the officer, ""I can't breathe,"" are now a rallying cry for people protesting the many black people who have died in police custody. Safia, a Somali immigrant, opened the restaurant in December 2018 with her retirement savings. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, she closed the restaurant and had to choose between paying for insurance and paying staff. So Safia chose her staff. That means there are no funds to rebuild. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family. This weekend, she had planned to reopen as the city started easing stay-at-home orders. She spent over $4,000 on groceries and cleanup. Now that plan is gone. ""It's not just me,"" she says. ""It's all of Lake Street, all of Minneapolis."" Her daughter Saida nods. ""This is a city in pain,"" Saida says. Across the street a row of restaurants — all locally owned, black- and immigrant-owned — are all gone. But the library is OK. In the rubble, Saida finds the sign she made for her mother when the restaurant first opened. Against the black ash the wood plaque is pristine. It reads ""Mama Safia's Kitchen. Seasoned with Love."" ""Because she always cooks with love,"" Saida says. She pulls a few more knickknacks that haven't burned. ""Most of the artifacts here, I got them from Africa,"" she says. ""This one is from Somalia."" She puts them into a tiny pile of what is salvageable. Outside is a tower of all that is lost. Her sister Bibi Abdullah walks in to help. She finds prayer rugs in the banquet room her mom would rent out for small wedding dinners and religious holidays. ""We can still use these,"" she says. ""We just have to wash them."" She searches for more things she can save. ""The truth is things like this happen when people feel powerless. Something has to change,"" Bibi says. Her voice catches. Her body seems to vibrate with a mix of anger and sadness. She says she hopes that these demonstrations translate to voters at the polls come November. ""It came to this because we have people that do not care in positions of power and it should not be that way,"" Bibi says. She and her sister start to clear the big debris together. Then Saida leads her mother, Safia, to the kitchen in the back so they can assess the damage. It's a tunnel of charred walls, ash and debris. Safia gets upset and pulls away, speaking to her daughter in Somali. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" Saida responds in English as her mother walks out. ""She's just saying, 'Why are you bringing me in here? I don't want to see this,' "" Saida says. Saida gets quiet. She stands in the kitchen alone for a moment, staring at the charred walls. Then she joins her family outside where dozens of Minneapolis residents from across the city are working in groups to clear the rubble. With everything unfolding, the pandemic has slipped many people's minds. ""I forgot. Have you seen me shake hands with people?"" Saida shakes her head. ""2020, we hear you, we see you. We went from one crisis to the next. What's next?"" Saida spends every night protesting, but also trying to protect other locally owned stores and restaurants. At night, she cries herself to sleep. She understands the anger and desperation that are leading some to destroy buildings. ""I'm like emotionally torn,"" Saida says. She doesn't want destruction. ""But at the same time, people are crying for help. People are saying, 'Fix this.' "" She says she hopes, from all of this pain, finally there will be change. ",0.0
1622125684,2020-06-01 05:00:00,Trump Seems Likely To Use Law And Order As A Wedge Issue After George Floyd's Killing,https://www.kios.org/post/trump-seems-likely-use-law-and-order-wedge-issue-after-george-floyds-killing,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"Through days of unrest, dozens of American cities — from Minneapolis to Atlanta, from New York to Grand Rapids, Mich. — have been wracked by violent protests. Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Some health experts have warned that a resurgence in cases could take place if Americans don't adhere to strict social distancing, or take other precautions like wear masks. The White House has also said that cases could go down in the warmer summer months. Does that happen? And if so, do Americans get too comfortable and lapse into a false sense of security — only to see a spike in the fall? None of it's clear, but the U.S. is heading into a period of pandemic experimentation with no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus as yet. 3. Could Steve King lose? Steny Hoyer faces challenge: It's hard to believe, but there are elections on Tuesday. Two of the marquee races deal with well-known — and very different — political figures. Controversial Rep. Steve King, with a history of making racist remarks, is in a fight for his political life with state Sen. Randy Feenstra in Iowa's Republican primary. Conservative groups have lined up against King, but he can't be counted out. This district has a long history of voting for him, despite his pariah status within the party. In Maryland, Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, is facing a primary challenge from the left in 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes, inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's unlikely win in New York over Joe Crowley, a former congressional Democratic leader. Iowa, Maryland and several other states, plus Washington, D.C., hold primaries Tuesday. 4. Biden to get closer to officially clinching nomination: Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is on the ballot Tuesday, too. Remember, he still hasn't acquired the delegates needed to officially put him over the top for the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of doing that. With 500 at stake Tuesday, Biden needs 85% of them Tuesday to clinch. That's unlikely, so look at next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote — with their 133 delegates up for grabs — for Biden to hit the magic number of 1,991. (Follow all the math here with the NPR delegate tracker.) 5. Origins of Trump campaign investigation to be probed: In Congress, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into members of the 2016 Trump campaign. The Senate is also expected to vote on nominations, including for the Treasury Department's inspector general for the pandemic response. And action is possible on changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. Last week, the House, nearly unanimously, passed a bill that reduces the percentage of the loans that businesses have to use toward payroll and gives businesses more time to spend the money and to pay the loans back. Flashback quotation: ""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, 'Please don't be too nice.' When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head]. Like, 'Don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?' "" — Trump, on July 28, 2017, speaking to law enforcement officers in Long Island, N.Y. : 5/31/20 A previous version of this story misspelled Freddie Gray's first name as Freddy.",0.0

About 20 states have seen decreases in recent days, and eight states are holding steady. One of the states with the biggest spikes in new cases is Florida. The number of new cases reported each day has increased an average of roughly 46% over the past week, just as most of the state entered a second phase of reopening.While big cities on the coasts were hit hard early in the pandemic, the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Utah, state Rep. Suzanne Harrison called a recent spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend.Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.Health officials raise concerns of virus spreading among protestsHealth officials have raised concern about coronavirus spread as thousands of people are now braving a pandemic to participate in the national protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday it was closely monitoring the demonstrations taking place across the U.S. and warned such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases.For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said without the lockdowns that most states put in place, that death toll could have been significantly higher.As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out and always maintain a distance.But the large protests make it hard to keep the recommended social distancing guidelines and ""may put others at risk,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.""It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal COVID-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground,"" she said.Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus.""I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,"" he said — especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.So far, more than 1,942,000 people have been infected in the U.S., and at least 110,514 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some states see rise in new casesWhile the early parts of the outbreak in the country hit dense metropolitan areas on the coast the hardest — including California and New York — the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Harris County, Texas, health officials said they identified a nursing home with both cases of the virus and deaths.On Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health said on Twitter. Utah State Rep. Suzanne Harrison called the spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend. ""Please be careful. Practice social distancing. Avoid crowds. Use masks where appropriate. Wash your hands.""Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs — including Arkansas State, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.An important drug could run out Meanwhile, as officials emphasize the U.S. is not yet out of the woods, a government official gave a stark warning. The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir last month. The drug, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola, is now used on hospitalized Covid patients. A study has shown it helps cut down the length of hospital stays.The government has been working to help Gilead ""with some of their supply chain challenges in terms of raw materials and being able to accelerate the process,"" Kadlec said.""Whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,"" he said.",0.0

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible.

(AP Photo/Steve Helber) Trump's bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to ""dominate the streets,"" Trump said the U.S. military would step in to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" the president declared. ""We're going to keep it safe."" A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd's death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd's death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John's Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump's critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president ""used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church."" ""It's all just a reality TV show for this president,"" he said on Twitter. ""Shameful."" Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump's statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee's state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city's flagship Macy's store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation's governors in a video conference that they ""look like fools"" for not deploying even more National Guard troops. ""Most of you are weak,"" he said. He added: ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges ""when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate."" In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd's brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. ""Let's switch it up, y'all. Let's switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd's family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family's attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. ___ Sullivan and Morrison reported from Minneapolis.

1622348131,2020-06-01 08:19:35,Trump briefly taken to underground bunker as protests grew outside White House,https://www.journaldemocrat.com/zz/news/20200601/trump-briefly-taken-to-underground-bunker-as-protests-grew-outside-white-house?rssfeed=true,en,False,,113585,journaldemocrat.com,http://journaldemocrat.com/,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place for a brief period of time as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote. This is the same bunker Vice President Dick Cheney was brought after the September 11 attacks when authorities feared a hijacked plane hijacked was heading toward the White House. President George W. Bush, when he returned to D.C. later that evening, was later taken there after a false alarm of another plane.

More than 4,400 arrests have been made at protests nationwide since viral video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day, resulting in Floyd's death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the incident was the right thing to do. Peaceful protests continued to be marred by violence. The Minneapolis Department of Public safety confirmed a semi-truck drove into a group of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35. The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Elsewhere, vandalism and looting continued across the country, as did the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by police in confrontations with protesters. Reports: President Trump hustled to bunker amid Washington protests President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion, according to multiple outlets. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Dozens of Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters over the weekend, and videos showed a large group of protesters – some burning flags and knocking over barricades. CNN reported that the president remained in the bunker for about an hour before returning to the residence, and it is currently unknown whether the First Lady and their son, Barron, were with him. – Savannah Behrmann 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. Illinois governor calls on National Guard to assist Chicago police Vandalism and fires were reported in several Chicago neighborhoods and some suburbs Sunday night after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot severely restricted access to downtown following nights of violent protests. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. ""This has been a scary and unsettling time, but I know we will get through this and begin the process of healing together,"" Lightfoot said in a midnight Twitter post. ""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in."" Protesters vandalize, set fire to police SUVs in New Jersey A group of people was captured on video destroying police SUVs in Trenton, New Jersey. In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.”",0.0

I POSTED LINKS TO AL Advertisement How to talk to your children about protests and racism Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video may contain images that are offensive. Viewer discretion is advised.As cities and social media explode with anger over the killing of yet another black man at the hands of police, worried parents struggle with how to protect their children from seeing the worst of the violence while simultaneously explaining the ravages of racism.It couldn't have come at a worse time.Sheltering at home for months to avoid the deadly coronavirus, many parents stressed by juggling work and child care from home had eased their restrictions on screen time for their children.Now it's even more likely that kids might find the video of George Floyd, an unarmed and handcuffed black man in Minneapolis, gasping for breath as a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck.Even if they haven't, experts say parents should assume their children are already aware of tragedies like these and their aftermath.""Children and adolescents are experiencing the collateral consequences of the publicized murderers of Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and George Floyd, whether they have a smartphone in their direct possession or not,"" said California pediatrician Dr. Rhea Boyd, who teaches nationally on the relationship between structural racism, inequity and health.""Whether from social media accounts, conversations with peers or caregivers, overheard conversations, or the distress they witness in the faces of those they love, children know what is going on,"" Boyd said. ""And without the guidance and validation of their caregivers, they may be navigating their feelings alone.""Take care of you firstHow can a parent help their child traverse these disturbing times?Let the child's age and level of development guide you, experts say, but first, be sure that you are in the right frame of mind.""A parent's first step is to take care of themselves, their mental health, their emotional health. Put their oxygen mask on first before they put the oxygen mask on their child,"" said Chicago pediatrician Dr. Nia Heard-Garris, who chairs the minority health, equity and inclusion committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).""Vicarious trauma through screens is real, especially for marginalized communities who may have experienced similar actions first-hand,"" said Dr. Jenny Radesky, a developmental behavioral pediatrician who teaches at the University of Michigan.The stress of watching traumatic events on television and smartphones ""lingers within our bodies and minds,"" Radesky added. She suggests parents find ways to channel that energy with positive actions, such as deep breathing and re-grounding exercises, before playing with or talking to your kids.""This doesn't mean letting go of the anger or anxiety, it just means organizing it better so you can think and act more clearly,"" she said.Once a parent is fully available to be a calm, rational voice, ""then you can parse out what's important to pass onto your child so that you're not oversharing information that may further traumatize them or make them feel insecure or unsafe,"" Heard-Garris said.Infants and toddlersWhile children younger than three aren't going to understand what is happening on television, they will be able to pick up on the ""fear, urgency, or anger in people's voices and behaviors,"" Radesky said.At this age, stress shows up in fussy or unregulated behavior. To keep that from occurring, parents should read, listen to or watch the news when the baby isn't physically there.""Watch what you need to stay informed about your community, but then turn it off and do something that makes your family feel connected and whole,"" Radesky said. ""You may need to re-ground yourself or regulate your thoughts and feelings before re-engaging with your kids.""This is the time to begin teaching your child about systemic racism and how to identify and refute it, experts say.Racist stereotypes and bias begin at a shockingly young age.As early as six months, a baby's brain can notice race-based differences, and can internalize racial bias by ages two to four, said Maryland pediatrician Dr. Jacqueline Dougé, who co-authored the AAP's statement on the impact of racism on child and adolescent health.""Learning"" racism is a lot like learning a new language for babies and toddlers, wrote Dougé and California pediatrician Dr. Ashaunta Anderson in a separate commentary. It can happen without parental input, just by the racial stereotypes so prevalent in society.By age 12, many children become set in their beliefs. That gives parents ""a decade to mold the learning process, so that it decreases racial bias and improves cultural understanding,"" they wrote.While helpful for all races, it's especially important for white children to see brown and black kids in a positive light to fight systemic racism, experts say. Books that profile multi-racial characters are an excellent way for parents to do that. And since it's never too early to read to a baby, start right away.Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that rates movies, TV shows, books, apps and other media for parents and schools, has curated a list of 80 books with diverse, multi-cultural characters for preschoolers and older, some of which could easily be suitable for babies and toddlers.""There's also a website called the Brown Bookshelf,"" said Heard-Garris. ""These are books that have, brown and black protagonists who deal at times with tough issues. I think books are really, really fundamental, especially for younger kids.""Preschool and elementary agesThis is the age when kids begin to ask questions on why other people look different than they do.""If your child asks about someone's skin tone, you might say, 'Isn't it wonderful that we are all so different!' You can even hold your arm against theirs to show the differences in skin tones in your family,"" according to Dougé and Anderson.At this age, children will see and absorb disturbing images from protests and riots literally, ""likely focusing on worrying about a burning van or a scary-looking person in a mask,"" Radesky said.Parents should do their best to limit the exposure children this age have to media, whether television, smart phones or tablets, experts say.""This can be done by setting certain times that children can use their devices, co-view the content with their children, find other activities like playing outside, games, cooking together, set rules that kids should use the devices in a common area where parents can check in,"" Dougé said.""These times also provide opportunities for parents to model the behavior they want their kids to follow by also limiting their exposure to media,"" Dougé added.But as Boyd said, children will likely have already overheard adult conversations, or been exposed to what is happening via social media accounts and conversations with friends.""Parents who have not already, should proactively engage their kids around these distressing events,"" Boyd said. ""Ask them what they know and what they've seen. Ask them how they are feeling. Validate their feelings and let them know what you are doing to keep them safe -- be it in your home or your community.""Parents will also need to give their children the broader societal context of racism in order to try to explain the rage of protestors filling the streets of cities across the nation, Radesky said.By doing so, parents can help build empathy and teach perspective-taking, rather than focusing on the child's specific fears.""Instead of focusing on questions the child may have about concrete things, ask them questions like 'How do you think those people were feeling? Do you know why they were angry? What do you do when you feel like something is unfair?' "" Radesky said.""Providing a controlled space to understand what is going on and ways to process it will help children navigate the distressing emotions, helplessness and fear they may be experiencing,"" Boyd said.Age-appropriate books that deal with discrimination and explain feelings from different perspectives are extremely helpful during this time, experts say.""You can also show them videos of peaceful protests from the past, where people were inspired to demand fair treatment,"" said Radesky, while warning that some YouTube videos can contain intense political and disinformation ads occurring before and during videos.""Just skip those and start showing your young kids the Martin Luther King Jr. or other video once the ad has passed,"" Radesky suggested. ""For older children, you can ask them what they think of different ads and whether they're trustworthy.""'The talk'For black families, there is another, more painful necessity at this age, known as ""the talk."" It's a series of ""don'ts"" black families have passed on for generations: Don't resist police. Stay away from bad places. Be respectful to white people and stay away from confrontation with white men, especially police.""We're black folks, so we don't have a choice but to talk about race and talk about racism,"" said Heard-Garris, who has a 7-year-old son. ""So he can tell you probably more eloquently than I can about racism and he's seven.""She recalls with pain when he asked her if he would be the target of police violence at the tender age of four after he heard adults talk about a recent police shooting of an unarmed black man.""He said to me, 'Are police here to help me or do they shoot me? I thought they're supposed to keep me safe. I thought they were supposed to keep us safe.' And he was four,"" she related.""And so we had a long conversation about how police are supposed to keep us safe, and I assured him that as his mom, that's my job. 'My first job is to always keep you safe,' I told him.""""As he grows, I'm going to have to have a more frank conversation that, 'Unfortunately, you're going to do all the right things, but you might not be safe."" And that's going to be a hard day for us.""The recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, an EMT who was killed in March after officers forced their way inside her home; Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old unarmed black man shot while taking a jog in rural Georgia in February; and now George Floyd's death, has many black parents afraid that ""the talk"" may not be enough.""The problem here is systemic racism and disregard for black lives,"" Heard-Garris said. ""And so as a doctor, I don't just treat a patient that has a fever when they have a bacterial infection, right?""I give them antibiotics. I don't just keep giving them Tylenol because that's not going to treat the infection. And I think as a country we need to treat the illness, which is systemic racism.""As Heard-Garris's story illustrates, when to begin ""the talk"" will be unique for each child and family, Boyd said.""For some, it may be earlier than expected, because evidence indicates black children in particular are often perceived as older and less innocent than they are. For black girls, this process of adultification can begin as young as age 5, and for black boys, it can begin by age 10,"" Boyd said.""Beginning 'the talk' with school-aged children can prepare them for these encounters before they occur and equip them with tools that can be life saving,"" Boyd added.As an African-American pediatrician, Boyd discusses the topic often with parents of children in her care. She advises black parents to think of ""the talk"" as more of a process than a singular conversation.""That process may begin with introducing stories through age-appropriate books or films that can generate questions you answer together. Or it can be an ongoing dialogue that is sparked by current events. Just remember to include specific guidance that enables your child to know their rights and the steps they can take to try and stay safe. And always be sure to let your child know it isn't fair they have to learn these lessons so young. But you are teaching then to try to keep them safe,"" Boyd said.White parents can have ""the talk"" too, Boyd said.""It's an important moment to build empathy with your child,"" she said. ""It is also important to highlight the other children who may have fears or concerns related to their safety, and to model and practice 'upstanding' or acting in defense of those around them.""Tweens and teensOf course, tweens and teens will likely be seeing all the coverage of police brutality and protests on their personal smartphones. Most teens get comfort by communicating with their friends on social media, Heard-Garris said. Some teens have even begun participating in online activism.""Online activism is a coping response for some adolescents, especially right now while we're physically distant,"" Heard-Garris said. ""Reposting, retweeting, expressing how they're feeling, chatting with friends has been helpful, sort of an active kind of coping response.""Other teens, especially those that are not of a minority background, so those that are white, are educating themselves about why this is happening, what's the history of our country, what's happening right now. Intellectualizing the issues has been helpful for them to understand this is not just a today problem, this has been going on for years,'"" Heard-Garris said.At this age, kids will be able to think more abstractly about racism, injustice and violent versus peaceful protest and discuss their views with parents, experts say.""Parents can ask their tweens or teens whether they've seen anything online about the riots and protests, what they think, and what about it was upsetting or inspiring,"" Radesky said.As the parent of any teenager will attest, direct questioning of teens often doesn't produce constructive responses.""I dunno,"" is a typical reaction, so Radesky suggests parents also try asking about the types of unfairness kids see or feel in their everyday lives.Parents can also make good use of movies and documentaries that can educate older teens on the history of discrimination. Common Sense Media has lists of movies that discuss racism or inspire kids to ""change the world,"" which can be used to jump start conversations about racism and how they can help fight it, Radesky said.""You don't need to preach to children about what is 'right' or 'wrong,'"" she said. ""It's better to have a conversation where they come to their own understanding and can see things in a larger social context.""Kira Banks, a clinical psychologist whose website ""Raising Equity"" provides free videos and resources on how parents can fight racism and cultivate an open mind in themselves and their kids, suggests parents watch movies like ""13th,"" a powerful look at institutional racism in the justice system that premiered in 2016 to a standing ovation at the New York Film Festival.""Is this a teachable moment? Absolutely. It must be, it has to be,"" Banks said. ""And if a person hasn't done the work to understand the history of racism and discrimination in America, they should do so, and then join us in raising our children to see and disrupt racism, and be the change we want to see.""The work must be done by all social classes and races, experts say, including the most privileged.""White and non-black families should not shield their older children from these images,"" Radesky said. ""We need to engage our children in a conversation about racism, and use these events as a catalyst.""While it is upsetting to watch, we need to sit with that discomfort and teach our families how to channel that energy to work to dismantle the racist structures that exist in our communities.""",0.0
1622402970,2020-06-01 11:08:35,What is antifa and what does the movement want?,https://www.journaldemocrat.com/zz/news/20200601/what-is-antifa-and-what-does-movement-want?rssfeed=true,en,False,,113585,journaldemocrat.com,http://journaldemocrat.com/,"Antifa — short for ""anti-fascist"" — is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0

The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Outside the White House on Friday, Secret Service could be seen after 7 p.m. taking at least one person into custody. Videos showed a large group of protesters gathering, with some burning flags and knocking over barricades. There were also some violent encounters. The president remained there about an hour before returning to the residence, according to a Republican close to the White House and an administration official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. It is currently unknown whether first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, were with the president but the family has been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, AP reported. ""The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. Officials told The New York Times, which first reported the story, they never believed Trump was in danger but took the precaution of moving him to the bunker as tensions escalated. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service, according to the AP. Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis police custody this week after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. His death has sparked demonstrations against police brutality and racial discrimination in cities across the United States. Trump praised the Secret Service and said he “watched every move” from inside the White House during Friday's protest and that he “couldn't have felt more safe.” ""They let the ‘protesters’ scream & rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard – didn’t know what hit them,"" he said Saturday. Trump continued, ""The front line was replaced with fresh agents, like magic. Big crowd, professionally organized, but nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had, they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least."" He also claimed DC Mayor Muriel Bowser didn't allow DC police to ""get involved"" and assist Secret Service, though Secret Service later said they were on the scene. Bowser, a Democrat, said on Twitter the city's police department would protect everyone regardless of whether the mayor agreed with them. ""While he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man,"" she wrote. This is the same bunker Vice President Dick Cheney was brought after the September 11 attacks when authorities feared a hijacked plane hijacked was heading toward the White House. President George W. Bush, when he returned to D.C. later that evening, was later taken there after a false alarm of another plane. The recent protests have led to one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since those attacks.",0.0

More than 4,400 arrests have been made at protests nationwide since viral video emerged showing former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes on Memorial Day, resulting in Floyd's death. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the incident was the right thing to do. Peaceful protests continued to be marred by violence. The Minneapolis Department of Public safety confirmed a semi-truck drove into a group of peaceful protesters on Interstate 35. The driver of the truck was taken into custody, but not before protesters pulled him from the truck's cab. The driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Elsewhere, vandalism and looting continued across the country, as did the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by police in confrontations with protesters. Reports: President Trump hustled to bunker amid Washington protests President Donald Trump was briefly moved to the White House's underground bunker Friday night to shelter in place as the protest grew outside the Executive Mansion, according to multiple outlets. The protests over George Floyd's death hit the nation's capital Friday night as angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House. Dozens of Secret Service agents were injured in clashes with protesters over the weekend, and videos showed a large group of protesters – some burning flags and knocking over barricades.

Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores At least 4,400 arrests since George Floyd's death: AP data At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over days of protests since George Floyd’s death on Memorial Day, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. About 150 people were arrested in Minnesota after violating curfew amid protests Sunday night, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. DPS continued to tweet about arrests late into the night and added, ""Even peaceful protesters who are breaking curfew are subject to arrest. Please go home and stay there."" DPS announced the arrests of more than 155 people Saturday night across multiple agencies. A dozen firearms were confiscated between the State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department. Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze amid DC protests As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. Illinois governor calls on National Guard to assist Chicago police Vandalism and fires were reported in several Chicago neighborhoods and some suburbs Sunday night after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot severely restricted access to downtown following nights of violent protests. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. ""This has been a scary and unsettling time, but I know we will get through this and begin the process of healing together,"" Lightfoot said in a midnight Twitter post. ""Please stay safe, and stay home."" Minneapolis police chief: George Floyd's death 'a violation of humanity' Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo told CNN that George Floyd's death was ""a violation of humanity."" Speaking at the site where Floyd died after fired police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family and said he had a ""visceral"" and ""emotional"" reaction to the video that has sparked outrage across the nation. “There are absolute truths in life,"" Arradondo told CNN. ""We need air to breathe. ... I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me what occurred out here last Monday, it was wrong.” When asked why he fired the four officers involved in the incident that led to Floyd's death, Arradondo said: ""In my mind, this was a violation of humanity. This was a violation of the oath the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on — this goes absolutely against it. This goes contrary to what we believe in.""

In the video, the people vandalize three police vehicles, smashing windows and hitting and kicking the vehicles. One of the people opens a door to the SUV and those at the scene start lighting things inside of it on fire. Police eventually got to the scene and began pushing back protesters as the vehicles burned behind them. Minnesota AG Keith Ellison to lead prosecution of Derek Chauvin Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that state Attorney General Keith Ellison will lead the prosecution in the Floyd case. Ellison called the case “unusual because of the way that Mr. Floyd was killed and who did it — at the hands of the defendant who was a Minneapolis police officer.” He said he expects to work together with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on the case. Ellison didn’t announce additional charges for Chauvin or charges for the three other officers involved in the incident. He added “prosecuting police officers for misconduct, including homicide and murder, is very difficult.” “Every single link in the prosecutorial chain will come under attack as we present this case to a jury or a fact finder and we need to make sure that we be absolutely prepared. We intend to be absolutely prepared.”",0.0
1622403364,2020-06-01 11:08:35,What is antifa and what does the movement want?,https://www.ncnewspress.com/zz/news/20200601/what-is-antifa-and-what-does-movement-want?rssfeed=true,en,False,,258736,ncnewspress.com,http://ncnewspress.com/,"Antifa — short for ""anti-fascist"" — is the name for loosely affiliated, left-leaning anti-racist groups that monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis. The movement has no unified structure or national leadership but has emerged in the form of local bodies nationwide, particularly on the West Coast. Some of the groups, such as the 10-year-old Rose City Antifa in Portland, the oldest antifa group in the U.S., are particularly well-organized and active online and on Facebook, while its members are individually anonymous. President Trump has singled out antifa as part of what he calls the alt-left in his initial claim that ""many sides"" were to blame for violence in Charlottesville the weekend of Aug. 12, not just the neo-Nazis, KKK and white nationalists. How is it pronounced? ""AN-tifa"" with the emphasis on the first syllable, which sounds more like ""on"" in English than ""an."" When did it start? Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the postwar period, antifa groups resurged to fight neo-Nazi groups, particularly in Germany. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist Action. What does the movement want? The primary goal is to stop neo-Nazis and white supremacists from gaining a platform rather than to promote a specific antifa agenda. The antifa groups are decidedly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-homophobia, but also by and large socially leftist and anti-capitalist. How do the groups operate? Mark Bray, a lecturer and Dartmouth and author of the new book Antifa: The Antifascist Handbook, says the groups ""organize educational campaigns, build community coalitions, monitor fascists, pressure venues to cancel their events, organize self-defense trainings and physically confront the far right when necessary."" A main goal is to try to deny fascists a public forum, which is why they turn out in numbers to physically confront neo-Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists at public demonstrations. They also step in to protect counter-protesters at such events. In addition, antifa is particularly active in ""doxxing,"" or identifying neo-Nazis and like-minded individuals and disseminating that private information to the public and employers to discourage people from joining their ranks. Is antifa violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in ""self-defense,"" protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views. ""We are unapologetic about the reality that fighting fascism at points requires physical militancy,” Rose City Antifa’s Facebook page reads. “Anti-fascism is, by nature, a form of self-defense: the goal of fascism is to exterminate the vast majority of human beings.” Political activist and author Cornel West, speaking to Amy Goodman on the program Democracy Now about the clashes in Charlottesville, said antifa intervened when the ""neofascists"" move against his group of protesters. ""We would have been crushed like cockroaches if it were not for the anarchists and the anti-fascists,"" he said. Bray says the rise of fascism in the 1930s demonstrates that it was a mistake to allow such groups to air their views in hopes that public opinion would blunt their growth. ""We should be wary of those who are more distressed about alleged violations of the speech of fascists than the actual violence they perpetrate,"" he says. Where has the movement demonstrated? In addition to Charlottesville, antifa forces, who often dress in black and wear masks, have confronted or clashed with far-right groups in such places as the University of California at Berkeley, where protests by West Coast antifa forces, some of whom smashed windows and set fires, forced the cancellation of a speech by alt-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos in February and another by conservative commentator Ann Coulter in April. In June, antifa forces turned out to protest a pro-Trump free-speech in Portland. Some antifa counterprotesters began throwing objects at police, who responded with flash grenades and pepper balls, according to the The Oregonian. Antifa was also out in force in June to confront Patriot Prayer, a free speech group protesting “political correctness and hatred” at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.",0.0

Wait, I get it. The nationwide calls for justice, as Floyd's death was ruled, a homicide by both the Hennepin County Medical examiner and in an independent autopsy authorized by the family. The autopsy shows that Mr Floyd had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death. Cause of death, in my opinion, is that's fix CIA due to compression of the neck. But the Hennepin County medical examiner released its summary, saying Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest without explaining what caused his heart to stop overnight curfews enforced in cities in at least 20 states in Washington, D.

Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard.Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.People marched in groups of thousands in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, as merchants boarded up their businesses. As the the curfew time arrived, many were still in the streets and continued marching, with officers initially standing by and allowing them.But officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody.

Journalists covering the protest reported the crowd was largely peaceful at the time; the Park Police said they were responding to protesters throwing items, including bricks and frozen water bottles at law enforcement.Justice Department officials offered a different explanation, saying officers were carrying out Attorney General William Barr’s order to expand the security perimeter outside the White House.Officers repelled the crowd nearly 30 minutes ahead of a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington. Shortly after the crowd was pushed back, President Donald Trump walked through the park where they had gathered for a photo opportunity at a nearby church.--------------Hundreds of people were gathered peacefully tonight at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. — a mix of black and white, young and old, looked out toward the Washington Monument.Several dozen uniformed guardsmen and women, along with Park Police, were standing on the steps of the monument.There were speakers and prayers and signs, calling for justice and an end to police brutality.“Together we are more,” a speaker said.On a breezy spring evening in Washington, this scene illustrates the peaceful demonstration that is starkly at odds with violent rioting and looting.“Make it quick,” one man said, “curfew is coming up in 30 minutes.”The peaceful demonstration concluded when the 7 p.m. curfew in D.C. went into effect.ATLANTA — Six Atlanta police officers are being charged with using excessive force during an arrest of two college students at a protest on Saturday night, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced Tuesday.The officers were filmed in downtown Atlanta breaking windows of a vehicle, yanking a woman out of the car and tasing a man.

In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would “start firing live rounds” at protesters and “see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.”Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state’s National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others “who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.”Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn’t a racist before resigning.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent.PHILADELPHIA — Joe Biden in a speech on Tuesday condemned President Donald Trump over the use of tear gas against peaceful protesters outside the White House in order to clear a park so that the president could visit a church for a photo opportunity.""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday.

Police said suspects were jailed despite a local court policy calling for most people accused of misdemeanors to receive court summons to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ST. LOUIS —Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area.The police department tweeted early Tuesday that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening.

Advertisement Officials see extremist groups stoking violence and disinformation during protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media.As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work.Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort.The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations.The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a ""very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers."" President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to ""identify criminal organizers,"" and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group.The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against ""violent radical agitators"" who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops ""easy targets,"" two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal ""kit,"" meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police.Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized ""Boogaloo"" movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war.She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some ""boogaloo bois"" in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear.""They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,"" MacNab said.She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest.Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina.Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity.The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump's handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were ""good people on both sides"" of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia.America's racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island.""This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,"" said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. ""That's one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don't create new issues, you exploit existing issues.""There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook.Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a ""child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities.Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials.",0.0

Smoke continued to waft in the air 24 hours after people protesting the death of George Floyd lit fire to Moore's storefront, and several others along Lake Street. ""My business burned down two days ago, you see the flames? It's still going,"" Moore, 41, said Sunday. ""That flame down in people's soul? It's still going. They want justice."" She is among dozens of Minneapolis and St. Paul business owners, small and large, trying to rebuild after fiery riots and demonstrations in the Twin Cities on Thursday and Friday. Her company, ""Levels,"" which also has a St. Paul location that remains undamaged, was Moore's ""baby."" Moore, a black woman, said she started the business from the trunk of her car once she left a job with Minneapolis Public Schools in 2011 to pursue her passion for fashion and music. It had been opened for five years before people broke in Friday and started a fire that destroyed her business and several adjacent stores. When she was alerted to the break-in, Moore went to Lake Street and watched nearly a decade of work collapse into the concrete. ""I'm hurt that I lost this. But ... I can't cry right now,"" she said. ""I can't go home and cry and be hurt because I lost businesses. George Floyd lost his life. He'll never be here again."" She's confident she can recover but isn't sure if she can rebuild at the same location — in the heart of a diverse southside neighborhood. A GoFundMe has been started to help with those expenses. Other small businesses face similar uncertainty, but several fundraisers have been started to help support Minneapolis' littlest companies. As looters ransacked his St. Paul store, this business owner hid in the bathroom and whispered to 911 In St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, just blocks from where Moore's second Levels location was protected by armed men standing on its porch, one business owner said he hid in his office as people ransacked, urinated in and damaged the building. Jim Segal closed Ax-Man Surplus earlier than normal Thursday afternoon because daylight looting took hold at the nearby intersection of University and Snelling avenues. After sending customers and employees home and locking the front door, Segal said he continued to work in the office of the six-decade-old company. Then he heard multiple glass windows break. ""Luckily, I have a steel door because they were trying to enter the office,"" said Segal, who bought the surplus store about 20 years ago. ""I don't think they knew anybody was in there, but I basically barricaded myself within a bathroom inside the office."" He felt as if he were in a movie, the St. Paul native said. As display cases were shattered and electronics taken from inside his store, he whispered to 911 dispatch asking for help. ""Police said, 'Don't even bother boarding up your store,'"" Segal said Saturday. ""'There's a 50/50 chance it won't be here tomorrow."" About 6:30 p.m. Thursday, he returned to the St. Paul Ax-Man location, one of three in the metro, in an unsuccessful effort to shoo away people running in and out of his store. A company agreed to board up his windows, Segal said, but left quickly after arriving, not wanting to work amongst the crowd. He tried to get a license plate of someone stealing, but others tried to take his phone so he retreated to his car. Segal sat in his vehicle for hours as rioters peed in his store and took items ranging from knick-knacks and DVDs to a snow-blower. He said coronavirus concerns forced him to close his business for the better part of two months. They'd been reopened a little more than a week when the building was ransacked. ""I don't recall ever being in a situation where I was that panicked. I was petrified, actually,"" he said. Ax-Man won't reopen for at least a week or two, and Segal fears it may close permanently because of the lack of sales during the spring. That would mean a loss of livelihood for him and about 10 employees. He sympathizes with those upset about Floyd's death in police custody on Memorial Day, describing the video of Minneapolis police officers' actions ""horrific."" ""This is just stuff, no comparison (to a person dying),"" said Segal, a white man. ""But what I'm disappointed about is the lack of leadership in the government — Mayor (Melvin) Carter, Mayor (Jacob) Frey, Gov. (Tim) Walz — to just allow lawlessness. ""Indefensible what happened to Mr. Floyd, but this doesn't make it better. And I don't know what does."" Insurance helps small business owners, but a full recovery is 'a lot more complicated' While Moore and Segal both said they are insured, they don't believe insurance alone will enough to replace everything they've lost. People typically see business owner and think ""wealth,"" Segal said. ""That's not true for me,"" he said. ""I'm the last one to get paid."" Understanding insurance policies can be difficult for many small business owners, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, which supports local companies. Lake Street has always been an area for Minneapolis's immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses, she said, and many of those folks may not be familiar with aid systems or insurance proceedings. ""There's a lot of detail to go through in your contract that most people don't really understand until a situation like this happens,"" Sharkey said. ""It's a lot more complicated than just paying a $500 deductible and thinking the rest is going to be covered."" Minority business owners may not have the credit or assets to withstand closures as long as white business owners with more resources, she said. The council, and other metro business associations like it, try to fill that gap and provide guidance, but insurance claims won't stop some businesses from completely fading away. For Moore, she's frustrated when people bring up the fact she's insured because it ignores the work she put into the building and the items she won't get back. ""When you get it out the mud — meaning when you get it on your own, no handouts ... someone just handing you money doesn't equate,"" she said. ""It's deeper than that."" Financial support is coming for Twin Cities small businesses left in rubble amid George Floyd protests When Segal returned to his business Friday, he found a person who lived nearby sweeping glass from the sidewalk, which raised his spirits. Monetary support has begun, too. It's especially vital, small business advocates say, because many companies were already running out of money because of closures due to COVID-19. The Lake Street Council has received over $1.5 million to help support the hundreds of businesses that line the heavily damaged area. Sharkey said companies owned by people of color and immigrants have been especially affected by the days of unrest. Several ""big, beautiful"" buildings on the southside have been replaced by rubble, which will be eventually replaced by vacant lots. ""($1.5 million) sounds like a big number, but we're gonna need a lot more government and nonprofit support,"" Sharkey said. ""We have a long road ahead of us."" She said her organization had already begun to save money to distribute to companies dealing with financial contractions from the coronavirus, but it's not been shifted to riot recovery. The council will request an aid package from the state, but Sharkey thinks they'll need federal dollars as well. ""We're headed toward a recession,"" she said. ""We're really going to have to create a long-term strategy along with stakeholders, business owners, property owners business groups, elected officials."" Donations to that fund can be made here. Fundraising has begun in Segal's area, as well. The Hamline Midway Coalition has received more than $75,000 to help aid small businesses in their recovery from property damage and lost sales. Kate Mudge, the coalition's director, said the organization has been raising funds to help small and minority business owners worried about gentrification and corporatization coming with the new U.S. soccer stadium built nearby. ""We already have been dealing with a pandemic, we've been dealing with some long-term issues in our community, and this is the icing on the cake. We hope that this is gonna bring new people to Midway, new businesses,"" she said. ""We've dealt with worse."" Donations to the Midway fund can be made at here. Despite the uncertainty, the organizations are confident many businesses will survive if community support keeps up. ""I'm not blaming people, you can't judge anybody's pain or anger. Everyone acts and reacts to things in different ways,"" Moore said. ""I have a black-owned business, it was burned down and we were protesting, for a black man's life that was taken. So, I was just a little confused on where we're going with this. But, at the end of the day, everything is about sacrifices.""",0.0

1622441773,2020-06-01 11:59:53,Biden meets with black leaders at church amid unrest,https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/Biden-meets-with-black-leaders-at-church-amid-unrest-570921841.html,en,True,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. Former Vice President Joe Biden bows his head in prayer as he visits Bethel AME Church in Wilmington, Del., Monday, June 1, 2020. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. ""Hate just hides. It doesn't go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,"" Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to ""deal with institutional racism"" and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and ""access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. ""I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,"" Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. ""I realize we've got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it."" Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as ""weak"" during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that ""Sleepy Joe Biden's people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more."" Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. On Monday evening, Trump declared himself ""the president of law and order"" from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S. He plans to deliver remarks on the unrest gripping the U.S. on Tuesday in Philadelphia. In the early moments of Monday's gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. ""The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,"" pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. ""I want to make something clear. I don't expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump ""ain't black."" Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. ""To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,"" said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. ""I'm sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. ""There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now."" ___ Jaffe reported from Washington; Peoples reported from Montclair, New Jersey.

WAVE 3 News reporter Kaitlin Rust appeared to have been hit by pepper balls, reportedly fired by a police officer, during a Friday night protest in downtown Louisville. (Source: WAVE/Gray News) Sunday night LMPD assistant chief Lavita Chavous said the officer, whose name has not been released, has been placed on reassignment until an investigation is complete. “Officers do have orders not to fire pepper balls at media but I’m sure you hopefully understand that sometimes when the media are involved inside the crowd or inside the area where there are protestors and those protestors are doing something unlawful or something they are not supposed to do it’s sometimes an unintended consequence when we fire the pepper balls into the crowd,” Chavous said. The pepper balls were fired at and hit WAVE 3 News reporter Kaitlin Rust and WAVE 3 News photojournalist James Dobson while they were reporting on protests in the city Friday evening. In response to what happened to Rust and Dobson, WAVE 3 News General Manager Ken Selvaggi issued a statement saying, “We strongly condemn the actions of the LMPD officer who tonight repeatedly fired at and hit our reporter and cameraman, both of whom were courageously and lawfully covering breaking news in their community. There is simply no justification for the Louisville police to wantonly open fire, even with pepper balls, on any journalists under any circumstances.” The statement also said, “When the officer fired at Ms. Rust and Mr. Dobson, the two had been following police instructions, were standing behind the police line when they were fired upon, and were not disrupting or otherwise interfering with law enforcement.” The U.S. attorney said federal authorities will join state police in investigating the fatal shooting. Later Monday evening, the massive group stretching for several blocks marched a couple of miles from downtown to the site where McAtee was killed just hours earlier. As the protesters passed, some motorists put their fists in the air and honked in solidarity with the marchers. Earlier, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer revealed that authorities lacked body camera video for the investigation just hours after Kentucky's governor demanded the release of police video. “This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,"" Fischer said. “Accordingly, I have relieved Steve Conrad of his duties as chief of Louisville Metro Police Department.” Gov. Andy Beshear later said the lack of body camera footage was unacceptable. “This is the entire reason that we have those cameras,"" the Democratic governor said at the state Capitol in Frankfort. “And every other officers’ cameras should be reviewed, and if they captured any part of the scene it ought to be released.” Beshear authorized state police to independently investigate the shooting. He pledged the probe will be conducted in an “honest and transparent way that will not take months.” U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman announced that federal authorities will be part of the investigation. “We understand this community’s need for answers and we will assess all the information, and will take any appropriate action that is warranted by the facts and the law.” Coleman's office said. The governor said he had counted on body camera footage to help determine “the truth in a way that spoke for itself, at a time when trust is difficult and people deserve to be able to see and evaluate."" The shakeup at the top of the city's police department came a month earlier than expected. Conrad had previously announced his resignation, which was to take effect at the end of June. Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder will step in immediately as chief, Fischer said. The mayor also said the city's curfew was being extended until June 8. Police did retrieve video from crime center cameras that showed how the shooting unfolded, Schroeder said. “It is taken from a distance, but it gives an overview of the scene and clearly shows the officers reacting to gunfire,” he said. Two Louisville officers and two Guard soldiers returned fire, he said. The two officers violated policy by not wearing or activating body cameras, Schroeder said, adding they have been placed on administrative leave. Protesters have been demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home. After Taylor's death, the mayor said Louisville police would be required to wear body cameras. Fischer said recently that officers in plainclothes units like the one that served a warrant at Taylor’s home would now wear the cameras during search warrants. Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, renewed her plea for peace Monday while demanding justice for her daughter. WAVE 3 News is owned by Gray Television.

Quincy Mason Floyd, and his sister Connie Mason, attended a peaceful Black Lives Matter on Sunday in Bryan, Texas. (Source: KBTX) Some are calling for peaceful demonstrations, including Floyd’s son, Quincy Mason Floyd. He joined hundreds of people at a Black Lives Matter demonstration Sunday in downtown Bryan. ""I'm really excited about all this. Everyone is coming out and showing him love,"" Floyd said. ""I love this. My heart is really touched by all this."" Floyd and his sister, Connie Mason, moved from Houston to Bryan with their mother more than 15 years ago. Floyd said he was a young child, about 4 or 5, when he last saw his father. ""I didn't recognize who it was until mom called and told me,"" he said. ""She said, 'Do you know who that guy was?' I said no. She said, 'That's your father.'"" Floyd says people have been surprised to learn about the local connection to this international story. He says some people at first questioned it. ""They kept asking, 'Do you have any proof?'"" he said. ""And I said, 'Yeah, look at my face and look at his face.' You can tell."" Floyd and his sister praised local protesters for hosting peaceful demonstrations and denounced the violence that has unfolded in other cities. ""The violence is not the right way to do it. Now, this is beautiful,"" Mason said. ""But the violence, it won't solve nothing."" The two plan to be in Houston on Monday to visit with other members of the extended family and hope to have news to share soon about funeral arrangements for George Floyd, who will be buried in the Houston area. Services are being planned by the Fort Bend Memorial Planning Center in Rosharon. ""Tearing up things, it's not going to solve anything. My dad is in peace, and we have to be the ones to deal with all this stress. It's going to be tough to get over this day by day,"" Floyd said. George Floyd died on Memorial Day after being taken into police custody in Minneapolis. His death resulted in the arrest of one police officer and the firing of three others and spurred a wave of nationwide protests that continued this weekend. George Floyd was a native of Houston and attended Texas A&M-Kingsville in the 90s. Copyright 2020 KBTX via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",0.0

Most demonstrations, some attracting hundreds of people, were peaceful though violence, including the burning of police vehicles and looting, prompted police in some cities to deploy tear gas to gain control of the crowd. Early in the day, volunteers turned out in many cities to sweep up debris from businesses that had been burned, had their windows broken or were otherwise damaged Saturday. Here's a look at how protests are unfolding around the country on Sunday: Washington, D.C.: Historic St. John's Church near White House set ablaze As protesters gathered near the White House, flames were seen at the Washington, D.C., landmark that bills itself as ""the church of the presidents."" The fire, apparently an act of arson, was in the basement of St. John's Church, across from the White House, The Washington Post reported, and was extinguished. It occurred as a demonstration was taking place outside. The gathering had attracted as many as 1,000 Sunday, who faced off against officers in riot gear. The Episcopalian church in Lafayette Square boasts on its website that every U.S. president since James Madison has attended services there. Consecrated in 1816, the church also says the bell in its steeple, weighing almost 1,000 pounds, was cast in 1822 by Paul Revere's son Joseph. New York City: Protesters force closure of Manhattan Bridge; street fires, looting A crucial bridge into Manhattan was closed Sunday to make way for protesters, a day after hundreds of arrests including the mayor's daughter, it was reported. Street fires were being set and sporadic looting was reported Sunday evening after a day that saw large groups of protesters walk from Brooklyn to Manhattan over the Manhattan Bridge, which had to be closed, ABC7 in New York reported. Mayor Bill de Blasio's daughter Chiara, 25, was among 345 arrested, the station reported based on unnamed NYPD sources. The Daily Mail said it was able to confirm the arrest from a police report. She was reportedly arrested as part of a group of 100 demonstrators who refused to leave a roadway when ordered by police. Seattle: National Guard called to Bellevue; protesters block Interstate 5 National Guard troops were ordered to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue after reports of widespread looting. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee ordered 200 National Guard members to Bellevue after the mayor declared an emergency due to violence. Rioters broke into the Bellevue Mall and were stealing goods from stores. The thefts were part of a day of protests in the Seattle area that included shutting down Interstate 5, the same freeway that San Diego demonstrators blocked more than 1,000 miles away in southern California. Chicago: Gov. JB Pritzker activates National Guardsmen to assist police Vandalism reports continued to crop up in several city neighborhoods and some suburbs. The communities of Tinley Park, Crestwood and Oak Lawn alerted residents to stay home due to civil unrest. Many businesses boarded up. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he activated 375 Illinois National Guard soldiers to assist local law enforcement with street closures. The downtown Chicago demonstrations that drew thousands started peacefully Saturday afternoon in a plaza, with protesters reading the names of black people who have died at the hands of police. But that gave way to violence and destruction that continued overnight Sunday in Chicago and elsewhere. Police used batons to beat back demonstrators as police cars were set ablaze and windows were smashed at businesses ranging from neighborhood convenience stores to high-end Michigan Avenue shops. Santa Monica, California: Unchecked looting as marchers confront police Looters took advantage of a large demonstration several blocks away to hit stores in the city's business district. In late afternoon, police were met with resistance when they tried to end a demonstration that had been peaceful. Demonstrators constructed a makeshift barricade in the middle of a street to protect themselves from non-lethal rounds fired by officers. The march had attracted hundreds along the city's main oceanfront boulevard. Though there were many police officers present for the march, looters were able to plunder stores with few to stop them. Cars were seen pulling up in front of stores, with looters running in to collect bundles of clothes and other merchandise, then running out. Boxes littered the sidewalk as thieves were seen transferring goods into plastic trash bags. A 5:30 p.m. PST curfew was announced due to the protests. The looting came despite the arrival of the National Guard troops in neighboring Los Angeles, which had seen extensive looting, vandalism and arson on Saturday. Murfreesboro, Tennessee: Brick thrown into business, police use tear gas A small but tense demonstration in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, appeared to have dispersed after demonstrators blocked traffic and threw a brick through the window of a local business, prompting police to respond with canisters of tear gas. About 50 protesters, many of whom appeared to be Middle Tennessee State University students, marched from Main Street toward Forrest Hall, a campus building named for Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said protests in Murfreesboro are now “overt threats to public safety and property.” Police said an armored vehicle was vandalized and protesters have blocked traffic by lying in the street in an intersection. Officers responded by throwing canisters of tear gas to drive protesters out of the street. However, before the protest escalated, negotiations between police and protest leaders led to calm, then students and officers were seen walking together and posing for photos. – Nancy DeGennaro, Joseph Spears, Mealand Ragland-Hudgins and Brinley Hineman, Murfreesboro Daily News Journal Savannah, Georgia: Protesters chant 'Arrest the other three' during rally Thousands demonstrated against racism and the killings of black people at the hands of police Sunday in Savannah, Georgia. City leaders joined protesters who peacefully marched from Johnson Square to City Hall. “We need to make sure that we stop apologizing and we move from apology to action,” Savannah Police Chief Roy Minter said. At one point during Mayor Van Johnson’s speech, the crowd broke into a chant of “arrest the other three,” referring to other Minneapolis police officers who stood by while an officer knelt on Floyd’s neck. “Yeah, they should arrest the other three,” Johnson said. “We are tired of the mess and we want it to stop now. We stand here as a united community to say that we are standing with George Floyd and his family, because no man should ever have to die like that,” Johnson said. “We stand here united as a community to say that crooked police officers are called criminals. And in jail, they should be.” – Will Peebles, Dennis Knight, Mary Landers, Nathan Dominitz and Zach Dennis, Savannah Morning News San Diego: Police fire tear gas after being assaulted by rocks and bottles San Diego Police said they fired tear gas canisters Sunday after rocks and bottles were thrown at them. The department said in a series of tweets that the confrontation was taking place at Second Avenue and Broadway in the seaside city's downtown. ""Certain protestors continue to throw objects and vandalize our city,"" the department said in one post. ""The criminal behavior of these few is unacceptable. We are continuing to order the crowd to disperse."" Earlier, however, the department praised the peacefulness of most demonstrators. But it said it had to issue the order to disperse because of the dangerous actions of a few. At one point, demonstrators occupied Interstate 5, stopping traffic in both directions, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Philadelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney 'saddened and disappointed' beyond words Another day of street protests gave way to looting, with at least one police vehicle set on fire. Looters were running out of stores in the northeastern section of the city with armloads of merchandise. In the downtown, workers and volunteers swept up broken glass from windows shattered during riots the previous day. Graffiti was being removed. Mayor Jim Kenney said the mayhem “saddened and disappointed me beyond words, and I’m sure it saddened every Philadelphian who takes pride in their city.” He said those responsible “not only desecrated private businesses, they also desecrated the important message that was heard in the earlier peaceful protests.” Spartanburg, South Carolina: Passing motorists show support for protesters Chanting “No justice, no peace,” about 100 peaceful Spartanburg, South Carolina, protesters gathered at Barnet Park, drawing support from motorists who honked their car horns. “We want to take a peaceful stand to show support,” said organizer Kelvin Brown. “If we can all come together as a people, black and white, we can make a difference.” Many protesters said it wasn’t just Floyd’s death at the hand of a white police officer, or that it took days before the officer was arrested, that triggered anger. “We need to end the racist system,” said Curtis Pickens. “If you want all this to stop, real justice is what is needed. Stop the racial and social profiling. Stop hiring white supremacist officers.” “It’s time to stand up for what we believe in,” Isaiah Jordan said. “What happened to George Floyd terrorizes the whole nation. We’ve got to do something about it. I’m just sick and tired of young, black men dying."" --Bob Montgomery, GoUpstate.com Lafayette, Louisiana: Protesters want police to know 'we're human' Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective face coverings, lined Lafayette streets to join a peaceful demonstration against police brutality. The protest, peaceful like others in Baton Rouge and New Orleans this weekend, began in the morning with protesters lining the streets to chant. “I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Lafayette NAACP President Marja Broussard said to protesters. “I have a message for law enforcement. The message is: we want you to know that we’re human just like you...We want you to know we have families. We’re human.” – William Taylor Potter, Lafayette Daily Advertiser Augusta, Georgia: Demonstrators chant 'No justice, no peace' Demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” as they walked along Washington Road in Augusta, Georgia. While “No justice, no peace,” was a popular chant among protesters, Sunday’s peaceful march was about showing strength through peace rather than through violence, organizers said. Latoya Lovett said she asked the Street Justice Council to help her organize the marches after hearing many Augusta residents talk about going to Atlanta to join protests there, which have turned violent after peaceful starts. “You can march in your own city, you can have a voice in your own city,” Lovett said. “You don’t have to go smash windows, you don’t have to go beat people, you don’t have to drop on the police.” Demonstrators were escorted by Richmond County Sheriff’s Office deputies who blocked off roads and intersections as needed. Sheriff Richard Roundtree was among those who helped guide the marchers and ensure safety for both them and the motorists. “We believe in free speech and protesting and voicing your opinion, as long as you do it in a safe manner,” Roundtree said. “As long as you’re doing that, we’re all for it.” – Will Cheney and Miguel Legoas, The Augusta Chronicle Jacksonville, Florida: Peaceful rally follows violent Saturday night of protests A peaceful demonstration was held Sunday outside the Duval County Courthouse. Then protesters started moving downtown and Jacksonville, Florida, police worked to keep them in certain areas. The cleanup of smashed store windows began Sunday around Florida after a night of unrest throughout the state’s cities. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said an unnamed deputy was either stabbed or slashed in the neck and was taken to a hospital for treatment Saturday night. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman would not comment on the deputy’s condition Sunday morning. A protest Saturday resulted in many arrests, “but we still don’t know how many or anything related to those arrests,” the sheriff said. – Sarasota News-Tribune Cincinnati: Police make 100 arrests after urging protesters to go home Police arrested as many as 100 people after using tear gas and imploring the crowd to go home ahead of a curfew. It ended a day that earlier featured a large crowd gathered at Inwood Park in Cincinnati to hear speakers as a rally, followed by a march. Organizers gave instructions about what to do if they are tear-gassed. The rally started with a fist-up salute and a song about the death Sam DuBose, shot by a police officer not far from the scene of this protest in 2015.

Mayor Jean Stothert announced the State of Emergency yesterday and it will last for 72 hours. Omaha also implemented an 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. curfew that started last night. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts has activated the National Guard to help maintain peace in Omaha. Demonstrations took place yesterday in North Omaha and the Old Market. The North Omaha rally at the Malcolm X Memorial Foundation ended before the 8:00 p.m. curfew, but police ultimately used tear gas and flash canisters to disperse the Old Market protestors. The curfew was imposed in part due to a fatal shooting that occurred during a protest in downtown Omaha on Saturday. The shooting occurred at around 11 p.m. Saturday in the city’s Old Market area and within a couple of blocks of where protesters had gathered. Police said they arrested someone within the hour in connection with the shooting of 22-year-old protester James Scurlock. Officials didn’t say what led to the shooting during the protests. Last night's protest near the Nebraska State Capitol became contentious after police and protestors clashed. Officers used tear gas to disperse the crowd, and some protestors threw fireworks at police.

How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why. Erlanger Turner: Many adults are hurt and angered by these events and their children may notice changes in their mood. It is helpful to have a healthy conversation around what happened and also talk about ways to cope when you witness social injustice. Does COVID-19 warrant avoiding these conversations, given many children are already struggling with fear, anxiety and uncertainty? BDT: No. Not talking about upsetting events only fuels fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Being able to talk about something with a supportive adult can reduce fear, anxiety and uncertainty. Parents may avoid the conversation because they don’t know what to say, but it is a mistake to think that their silence is helpful. ET: I don't think that anxiety and fear about COVID-19 should stop a parent from talking about police brutality. This issue has been increasing in concern over the last few years as the number of black and brown people killed by police continue to rise. I think if you do talk with your child don't leave them in a high state of worry. Make sure to end the conversation by engaging in a pleasant activity after the difficult discussion so they won't stay worried or afraid. How do parents start these conversations and how does that change depending on the age of their children? ET: I think the first place to start a conversation around racism and police brutality is with honesty. Take ownership of your feelings and be comfortable sharing those feelings with your child. Then you can begin to allow them to share what they may already know about racial differences. I think that it is always good to allow children to share their opinion and understanding before you offer information. For younger children conversations about racism should be limited to basic facts about how people are treated differently due to the color of their skin but also acknowledge that not everyone treats people differently based on race. For older teens, parents can consider exposure to news or social media posts as discussion points about this issue. BDT: Regardless of the age of the child, it is important to balance acknowledging the reality of racism, or unfairness, with messages about the possibility of change, and the community of allies who are working together to make things better. If a child of color asks if a police officer is going to kill them, what do you say? BDT: The answer will depend on the age of the child. If it is a young child, a parent can be reassuring. “No, honey, you don’t have to worry about that. Police officers don’t want to hurt you.” In response to an older child, it can be reassuring to say something like: ""I know that it is scary to think that something like that might happen, and I really don’t want you to worry about anything like that. I know that most police officers want to help people, and most police officers never fire their guns. But sometimes they do get nervous and make mistakes. So it is important for you to know what to do if a police officer ever stops you…” Black parents often refer to this as “the talk” they have to have with their adolescent sons to increase the odds they will survive an encounter with a police officer if and when they are stopped. ET: That is a tough question. Depending on the age of the child, they may have some awareness of youth that have been killed by police. Obviously you don't want to respond in a way that is going to make children be more fearful for their safety. In my opinion, I think that you should let children know that most police officers work to protect them and their community. If a child says they are afraid or angry, what do you say? BDT: Acknowledge the child’s feelings. The parent may have similar feelings. “I know it’s upsetting to hear about and see these things happening. It upsets me too when bad things like this happen. Racism is very unfair. But it makes me feel better to know there are lots of people who want to change things."" Being able to offer specific examples of community change agents would be useful. Being able to talk about what family members are doing to speak up against unfairness is especially useful. Actions always speak louder than words. ET: If a child tells you that they are angry, that is appropriate. Don't force them to hide their emotional expression. However, be sure to help them identify ways to express their anger in a healthy manner which may include journaling or exercising to release the energy from their body. If a child is afraid for one of their friends, what do you say? BDT: “I can see that you are worried about your friend. What do you think we could do that might help him or her?” Depending on the situation, this could be an opportunity to talk about what it means to be an ally, and how to stand in solidarity with another person. ET: If a child is afraid for one of their friends, talk with them about those emotions. Allow the child to express why they may be afraid and help them identify how they can check on their friend's safety to ease their anxiety or fear. Part of what increases anxiety is the fear of the unknown. If you have a plan of action it will reduce some of those fears. How can parents talk about law enforcement in a way that is honest but also doesn’t discourage children from seeking help from law enforcement when appropriate? BDT: Most police officers become police officers because they want to help people. And there are times when we would really want a police officer to help us – give some examples – if there’s been a car accident, or if someone took something that belonged to us, etc. But sometimes a police officer does something bad, like today. When that happens, we might start to think that all police officers are like that. But it’s important to remember that that is not true. ET: I think that it is very important to talk with the children about law enforcement. For example, you can talk with them about how they protect rules in society such as making sure that people don't drive too fast so they won't harm themselves or others. Providing clear examples about the ways that law enforcement helps society will allow the child to better understand. You can also be honest about situations such as police brutality and let children know that some police officers break laws. If you have a trusted officer in your community it may be good to also allow the child to talk with them in person to reduce their fear. Should these conversations be different depending on the race of the child? BDT: Children of color are likely to experience racist encounters as they get older. They need to be helped to understand their own worth and feel affirmed in their identity as young people of color despite the negative messages they may get from others. Parents of color want to raise self-confident and empowered children who are not demoralized by other people’s racism. This requires lots of conversation about racism and how to resist it in an ongoing way throughout their children’s lives. White children are often racially isolated as a consequence of segregated schools and neighborhoods, and consequently limited in their understanding of people different from themselves. White parents who want to interrupt the cycle of racism must learn to talk to their children about it and model their own anti-racist activity. ET: According to research, white parents often don't talk with their children about race or may emphasize ""not seeing color."" The concept of colorblindness or ""not seeing color"" is more harmful than helpful and does not honor an individual's identity. ... For white families, research suggests ... conversations should focus on raising anti-racist children and encouraging more friendships with children from others races. Many of these deaths garner attention because footage of it goes viral. What should we say if our child asks to see it? BDT: There are many adults who don’t want to see such footage. I would not show it to a child at all. Once an image is in your head, it is very difficult to get it out. That said, it is reasonable to describe what happened and talk about why it was wrong. It is also likely that children with Internet access can view the footage without an adult’s permission or assistance. Talking about it after the fact will help children process their feelings. ET: You should not show your children these videos as it may increase the likelihood of them experiencing symptoms of trauma or having nightmares. What we know from research on witnessing disasters is that individuals may be at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder even through indirect exposure to these events. What do we say if, in the course of this conversation, a child says something racist? BDT: Inquire about it with curiosity, not judgment. ""I’m wondering why you said that…"" After hearing more about what the child is thinking, you can offer correction by providing new information. “You know, a lot of people might think that is true, but I don’t because….” ET: I think the first thing to do is to not get defensive. You want to foster open communication with your child. However, I think you should explore why they have that opinion, where did they learn it from, and tell them why what they said was wrong. It might be helpful for you as a parent to think about ways that you may have unconsciously expressed racist attitudes. How can parents explain the uprisings in a way that doesn’t condone violence but also doesn't minimize the sense of injustice fueling them? BDT: Children understand the concept of unfairness as well as the experience of frustration. Years and years of unfairness – racism – results in intense anger and frustration. The conversation can then be about what we must do to fix the continuing unfairness. ET: I think it is important for parents to be honest. Share your hurt, anger, or disappointment with your child. You should also talk about different ways to protest social injustice such as calling your local politicians office or even visit their office to talk with them about policy change to reduce injustice.

What do we tell our children?,https://www.ncnewspress.com/zz/news/20200601/george-floyd-ahmaud-arbery-breonna-taylor-what-do-we-tell-our-children?rssfeed=true,en,False,,258736,ncnewspress.com,http://ncnewspress.com/,"Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ""the talk"" once again. These deaths are part of a more complex story, one some parents have been telling for generations, and others have long felt they've had the luxury to ignore. But experts in child psychology and race-based stress say these conversations are essential for all parents to have, and they underscore that there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to children of all ages about racism and police brutality. ""Silence will not protect you or them,"" said Beverly Daniel Tatum, a psychologist and author of, Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? And Other Conversations About Race. ""Avoiding the topic is not a solution."" Racism persists, experts say, because many parents avoid difficult conversations. ""One of the most important things to remember is that you may not have all the answers and that is OK,"" said Erlanger Turner, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies mental health among racial communities. USA TODAY spoke with Tatum and Turner about how to talk with children about racial violence: Why is it important to talk with children about what happened to George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality or racism in the news? Beverly Daniel Tatum: Even young children may see or hear about highly publicized incidents like the George Floyd case – perhaps overhearing the TV or the radio – and may ask questions. Or if parents are upset by the news, the child may perceive the parent’s distress and ask why mom or dad is upset. In either case, an age-appropriate explanation is better than silence. Older children with Internet access may see online images on their own. Initiating an age-appropriate conversation can give children a helpful frame for understanding difficult realities. If parents are silent, children will draw their own often faulty conclusions about what is happening and why.

Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer.

Knutson, 40, sat down on a chair on the sidewalk outside a boarded-up Franklin Avenue café, planning to rest her sunburned feet. Above her, a large sign read: “Free Food and Stuff.” Residents of the south Minneapolis neighborhood surveyed the scene and decided that Knutson was in charge of a popup pantry. Soon, they descended on her with sacks of bread, beans and other groceries, plus diapers, bottled water and even more garbage bags ready to be filled. Knutson, who said she is recently homeless, enjoyed giving the goods away to a line of people who politely approached her, asking if it was really free. “Anything you want, brother. Take anything,” she implored one hesitant man. “I love you.” A few blocks away on Franklin Avenue, an east-west thoroughfare lined with stores that now sit empty, Alan Gross oversaw an impromptu food shelf that quickly resembled a warehouse.

The latter is a large space that typically displays American Indian art. It was shuttered in March after the COVID-19 threat forced the closure of museums and galleries in Minnesota. The art has been relocated, although Gross hopes to reopen soon. On Sunday, the floor was rapidly filling with food brought in by the carload from people eager to help. It all happened over the course of 72 hours, after word went out on Facebook that the gallery would serve as a distribution point for groceries in the neighborhood. Gross was surprised by the amount of donated food but philosophical about the motivation of his fellow Minnesotans. “Pitching in, believing that there’s a better way to do things, I think that’s the draw,” he said. “Everyone’s got to have a cause.”",0.0

Jack Manderscheid, a University of Minnesota senior, exemplified the spirit of the day by meticulously walking through the Uptown neighborhood filling up four trash bags that he carried on his bicycle. “I’ve never really seen a community come together,” said Manderscheid, a native of suburban Edina who woke up Sunday intent on finding one gesture to help put the city. There have been five nights of anguished protests following the Monday death of George Floyd, a black man whose neck was knelt on for nearly nine minutes by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer. Manderscheid had attended a demonstration earlier in the week, but the fumes from tear gas used by police officers bothered him.

AGAIN, IF YOU HAVE ANY VID Advertisement Douglas County Attorney calls death 'senseless, but justified', no charges in shooting of protester Share Shares Copy Link Copy Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine announced Monday that there would be no charges against Jake Gardner in the shooting death of 22-year-old James Scurlock, a black man who was killed amid protests in the Old Market Saturday night. ""Douglas County is a community of people I truly love. And I've been very proud of and very proud to serve as the county attorney in this this great county that we live in,"" he began his remarks.Kleine said the death of Scurlock was ""senseless,"" because the situation stemmed from what was meant to be peaceful protests.Kleine said the determination has been made that the shooting was in self-defense. He said that there is video evidence that he wants the public to see and that the decision that has been made is based on all of the information the office has currently. ""The other thing I would ask if there is any other evidence that people are aware of other videos. Other witnesses. Anything else that would guide us or help us in decision making process, we would still like that, to come forward because I'm going to talk to you about the decision we've made it based at this point in time,"" he said. They want people to call 402-444-5656.He called the misinformation he has seen on social media ""troubling."" Kleine said there is no audio in the office's possession that indicates any racial slurs were used and witnesses agreed. Kleine walked the audience through the footage, showing footage that he said shows the father of the bar owner, Jake Gardner pushing young people in the area, then being shoved. Gardner came up, asking, ""Who did that? Who pushed my dad?"" Someone was heard in the video saying, ""he has a gun on him,"" referring to Gardner. Kleine draws attention to the fact that windows are seen broken out of the bar. Kleine said the video shows a group of people surrounding Gardner, tackling him and Gardner firing two warning shots. Kleine said Scurlock jumps on Gardner and and the bar owner fires another shot, fatally wounding Scurlock. Kleine said Gardner is heard saying, ""Get off me, get off me, please get off me,"" before the final shot is fired. The bar owner was identified as Jacob Gardner, who owns The Hive and Gatsby's. He said they would not normally name the individual because no charges are being filed.Kleine said that he understands the emotions that surround Scurlock's death, but he has to focus on ""justification for use of force."" ""You can't use deadly force to protect property,"" he said. ""Deadly force can only be used if someone is in fear of their own life or serious bodily injury and they don't feel like they can retreat safely. Even if they are mistaken, if their beliefs have a reasonable basis, it's justifiable for them to use deadly force...that's what the law is."" Kleine said Gardner believed Scurlock was attempting to grab his weapon. ""It is a senseless death, a loss of a young man's life, it shouldn't have happened,"" he said. ""We know that emotions are running very high...this decision may not be popular and may cause more people to be upset. I would hope that they understand that we're doing our job to the best of our ability and looking at the evidence and the law. And that's all we can do. All right, that's what the basis of this decision was it can't be based on emotions, it can't be based on anger, it can't be based on any of those things. But I would hope that this great community that we live in, will be able to get through this.""Kleine said there was consensus among law enforcement that Gardner's actions were justified. He said he was disappointed to see people calling the death ""a cold blooded murder.""""That is not what we have here,"" he said.Kleine said he dreaded someone being hurt in the protests.""I prayed nothing bad would happen. Always a fear, I was hoping and praying to God no one pull a gun out and do something, and it happened. It saddens me to no end to see our community go through this kind of thing,"" he said. One of the protesters who tackled Gardner told KETV Newswatch 7's Michelle Bandur, she had to act when she heard someone had a gun.""I knew it was not going to end well,"" Alayna Melendez said.Melendez, 19, said she had been at the protests Friday and Saturday at 72nd and Dodge and moved downtown closer to home. ""Silence is violence,"" she said.Melendez said as a person of color, she had to jump in to help.""I grabbed him from behind and pulled him to the ground and as soon as I pulled him to the ground, people gathered around us and he had his hand positioned in a way and just shot,"" she said.Melendez said Gardner fired two warning shots.""The very last shot, that got him (Scurlock) and that killed him,"" she said.Melendez gave a statement to police hoping it would help bring charges against Gardner.She also says she would do it again.""I was not scared to lose my life that night. I was fully indebted to losing my life and fully aware I could have lost my life that night,"" Melendez said. Gov. Pete Ricketts said: ""Don Kleine is a well-respected prosecutor in the law community both in Omaha and in the state. If Don Kleine doesn't believe he can bring charges at this time, I believe him. Keep an open mind. We have to heal, and move on together.""Below: James Scurlock's family responds to decision not to charge man who shot, killed him",0.0

ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND THE ENTIRE POLICE DEPARTMENT, OUR CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF JAMES SCURLOCK. MAY 30 IN THE CITY OF OMAHA WAS A VERY HECTIC NIGHT. THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE IN THE AREA OF 12TH AND HARNEY BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE SHOOTING IN WHICH MR. SPURLOCK -- MR. SCURLOCK LOST HIS LIFE. THE ROLE OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS TO INVESTIGATE, AND PRESENT, THE EVIDENCE TO THE COUNTY, WHO WILL MAKE A CHARGING DECISION. WE KNOW THERE WERE PEOPLE IN THE AREA THAT HAVE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED, SO GET WITH US AND COME IN FOR AN INTERVIEW. YOU CAN REACH OUT TO OUR HOMICIDE UNIT AT 444-5656. IF YOU WITNESS THE EVENT OR HAVE VIDEO OR AUDIO. THE BROADER CONTEXT IS TO THE EMOTIONS SURROUNDING THE DECISION. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE. WE ARE HERE, THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT, TO HELP FACILITATE PEACEFUL PROTEST AND EXPRESSION, AND WE ENCOURAGE THAT. WE ENCOURAGE IT GREATLY. WE DO NOT WANT ANYONE TO GET HURT, SO VIOLATIONS TO THE LAW OR CIVIL UNREST, WE ARE ASKING THAT NOT TO OCCUR. THERE ARE AGITATORS FROM OUTSIDE OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT DO NOT REPRESENT OR ANYTHING WE STAND FOR -- REPRESENT THE CITY OF OMAHA OR ANYTHING WE STAND FOR. IN CONTRAST TO THE PEACEFUL PROTESTS OF OVER 1000 PEOPLE HOSTED BY THE MALCOLM X FOUNDATION YESTERDAY. THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE COMMUNITY HAVE A TREMENDOUS PARTNERSHIP, AND THAT IS MY PROUDEST STATEMENT I CAN EVER MAKE AS CHIEF. WE KNOW EVERYONE IS HURTING AND WE WANT TO GET STARTED WORKING RIGHT NOW WITH OUR COMMUNITY. OUR REALITY IS THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AS IT RELATES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PERSONS OF COLOR HAS NOT BEEN STELLAR. AS A MATTER OF FACT, RECENT HISTORY, AS A WEEK OR SO AGO, HAS CAUSED FURTHER STRAIN NATIONWIDE. I CAME OUT VERY STRONGLY AND SPOKE AGAINST THE ACTIONS OF THE MINNEAPOLIS POLICE OFFICER. OMAHA HAS BEEN A VERY SPECIAL PLACE. WE HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT HAS COME TOGETHER TO WORK THROUGH ALL OF OUR ISSUES. WE HAVE BUILT A ALONG THE WAY. AS CHIEF, IT HAS BEEN MY MOST REWARDING WORK TO HAVE THE GREATEST COMMUNITY PARTNERS. WE ARE GOING TO MEET WITH THOSE COMMUNITY PARTNERS STARTING RIGHT AFTER THIS PRESS CONFERENCE. OK, SO I WANT TO -- WE WANT TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. WE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IT TO THE EVENTS OF THE PROTEST, AND IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO OTHER THINGS, WE CAN. BUT ONE THING I’M NOT GOING TO DO IS GO THROUGH THE TENANTS AND DETAILS OF THE SPURLOCK INVESTIGATION AS COUNTY ATTORNEY DON KLEIN. --KLEINE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO REHASH WHAT HE SAID AS TO THE EVIDENCE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A MICROPHONE THAT IS BROUGHT BY, I WILL CALL ON YOU, GIVE YOUR NAME PLEASE, IN THE AGENCY YOU WORK WITH.

ALSO TO THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, WE GET A LOT OF FEEDBACK THAT SOMETIMES THEY CAN HEAR THE QUESTIONS YOU SAY TO US. SO PLEASE REMEMBER TO SPEAK LOUDLY. OK? THANK YOU. THE FIRST QUESTION IS RIGHT HERE. REPORTER: HI, ASHLEY WITH SIX NEWS. YOU JUST SPOKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IDENTIFYING PEOPLE THERE THAT WERE IN THE CROWD WHEN JAMES SCURLOCK WAS KILLED. ARE YOU GUYS MISSING THINGS THAT YOU NEED FOR YOUR INVESTIGATION? WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU IDENTIFIED THOSE PEOPLE? CHIEF SCHMADERER: WE ARE SAYING THAT BECAUSE THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED A COUPLE DAYS AGO. THE DECISION HAD TO BE MADE TO BECAUSE YOU MAKE A LEGAL DETERMINATION OF WHETHER OR NOT TO HOLD SOMEBODY AT THAT PERIOD OF TIME. YOU CAN ONLY HOLD SOMEBODY SO LONG LEGALLY BEFORE YOU HAVE TO LET THEM GO. THAT’S WHY THE CHARGING DECISION HAD TO BE MADE. THAT DOESN’T MEAN THAT ONE THING CAN’T CHANGE. IT ALSO DOESN’T MEAN THAT WE HAVE A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION AFTER TWO DAYS. WHAT THE COUNTY ATTORNEY SAID IS THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME, HE’S MADE THAT DECISION. WE DO WANT TO HEAR EVERYTHING THAT OCCURRED DOWN IN THE MARKET. ONE THING WE ARE MISSING OUR AUDIO PORTIONS AS TO WHAT WAS SAID. WE ARE HOPEFUL SOMEBODY HAS GOT SOME AUDIO. WE HAVE SOME PRETTY GOOD VIDEO FOOTAGE BUT AUDIO IS MISSING. THERE IS ALWAYS DIFFERENT CAMERA ANGLES AND THINGS WE WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT AS WELL. THANK YOU. REPORTER: I’M WITH NEWS CHANNEL NEBRASKA. THE FAMILY OF MR. SCURLOCK IS ASKING FOR A GRAND JOURNEY -- GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION. CHIEF SCHMADERER: I’M NOT SURE ON HOW THAT SHAKES OUT LEGALLY, IF THAT IS AN OPTION OR NOT. CERTAINLY, IF THE COUNTY ATTORNEY WANTED -- IF THAT WAS A LEGAL OPTION AND THEY WANTED TO PRESENT THAT, SURE, I WOULD BEFORE THAT. BUT I DON’T KNOW HOW THAT WORKS IN THE LEGAL REALM. REPORTER: LOOKING AHEAD TO THIS EVENING, WILL THE SAME NUMBER OF OMAHA POLICE, NATIONAL GUARD, STATE TROOPERS BE THERE THIS EVENING? CHIEF SCHMADERER: YES, WE HAVE A VERY LARGE CONTINGENT OF MULTI AGENCY JURISDICTIONS, OMAHA POLICE, AND NATIONAL GUARD ON HAND IN THE CITY OF OMAHA. TONIGHT. REPORTER: I’M KELSEY STEWART WITH THE WORLD HAROLD. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO QUELL POTENTIAL VIOLENCE? WHAT’S YOUR MESSAGE TO THE GREATER COMMUNITY? CHIEF SCHMADERER: LET ME START WITH MY MESSAGE TO THE GREATER COMMUNITY. LET’S REMEMBER WHO OMAHA WAS SEVERAL DAYS AGO, BEFORE NATIONAL EVENTS TOOK OVER AND TOOK A HOLD ON TO EVERY COMMUNITY ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. OMAHA WAS A COMMUNITY THAT HAD MADE GREAT STRIDES IN POLICE COMMUNITY RELATIONS. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS PARTNERSHIPS. WE ARE A COMMUNITY THAT BOTH SIDES, THE POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY, WANT TO BE IN A STRONG RELATIONSHIP. YOU CAN’T SAY. THAT IN EVERY CITY WE HAVE THAT HERE -- YOU CAN’T SAY THAT IN EVERY CITY. WE HAVE THOUGHT HERE. SOME OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE PEOPLE I DEAL WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. WE ARE ON A VERY GOOD FOOTING HERE IN OMAHA. LET’S NOT FORGET THAT. LET’S NOT LET THE NATIONAL INCIDENT THAT CAME IN HERE, THAT WE’D ANNOUNCED, WE KNEEL WITH EVERYONE ON THAT, LET’S NOT LET THAT DISTRACT FROM WHAT WE ARE DOING. AND LET’S GET BACK TO THE BUSINESS OF WORKING OUT OUR PROBLEMS AS A POLICE DEPARTMENT IN COMMUNITY TOGETHER. THAT’S WHAT WE DID BEFORE THIS. IT HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE. IT HAS BEEN SO EFFECTIVE, IT HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES. IT SHOWS US THAT THE ROADMAP WAS WORKING. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. THAT IS PROBABLY MY GREATEST THING RIGHT NOW. I JUST REALLY AM LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING BACK TO THE ISSUES AT HAND AND WORKING DIRECTLY WITH OUR COMMUNITY. AS FAR AS ANTICIPATION OF TONIGHT, I’M NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF MAKING GUESSES. I’M IN THE BUSINESS OF BEING A PREPARER. SO WE ARE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING THAT MAY OCCUR TONIGHT. ALTHOUGH, I HAVE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE, I HAVE SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN THIS COMMUNITY. SO MUCH CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IN THEM. I WOULD NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THEM AT ALL. >> CAN I SAY A FEW WORDS? I WANTED TO ADD, THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT, OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN IMPROVING POLICE COMMUNITY RELATIONS. AND THEY HAVE BEEN GOOD. WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY, BEING OUT IN THE COMMUNITY, COMMUNITY POLICING, THE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN GOOD AND THEY CONTINUE TO GET BETTER. THE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED UP IN MINNESOTA, IT FRACTURED RELATIONSHIPS NOT ONLY HERE, BUT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. AND WE SAW THAT ON THE NEWS. WE SAW IT ON NATIONAL NEWS AND WE SAW IT HERE. NOW IT IS TIME TO HEAL THOSE FRACTURES. THE VIOLENCE THAT WE SAW HERE DOESN’T HELP ANYBODY. THE VIOLENCE WE SAW HERE IN OMAHA, THE DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, THE INJURIES WE SAW, THE THINGS WE SAW HAPPENING HERE IN OMAHA, THAT IS NOT GOING TO MAKE THESE FRACTURED RELATIONSHIPS BETTER. IT IS TIME TO MOVE FORWARD. AND I THINK YES, WE CAN ALWAYS DO BETTER. WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO DO BETTER. I THINK I SAID THE OTHER DAY, IF ANY MAYOR WOULD STAND UP IN FRONT OF YOU AND SAY, WE ARE AS GOOD AS WE CAN GET, I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT MAYER IS WRONG. I THINK WE HAVE THAT FOUNDATION ALREADY BUILT. ALREADY BUILT. YOU DO NOT HANDOUT TRUST. HAVE TO EARN IT. THEY HAVE EARNED IT OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, I BELIEVE. I THINK WE WILL GET THAT BACK, AND I AGREE WITH THE CHIEF. OMAHANS ARE A DIFFERENT BREED OF PEOPLE. NEBRASKANS WORK TOGETHER AND HELP EACH OTHER. WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER. WE WILL GET OUT OF THIS. WE WILL GET BETTER BECAUSE OF THIS. THESE INCIDENTS ESPECIALLY -- THE SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED ON SATURDAY NIGHT -- THEY ARE HEARTBREAKING FOR ALL OF US TO SEE. I THINK SO MANY OMAHA ONES -- OMAHANS WANT TO NOT JUST GET BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE, BUT MAKE IT BETTER. THESE RELATIONSHIPS, WE ALWAYS HAVE TO WORK ON THEM. I DO WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR BRINGING IN THE NATIONAL GUARD. THAT HAS BEEN GREAT HELP. I KNOW NONE OF US LIKE TO SEE THE ENTRYWAYS TO DOWNTOWN, THE STREETS, THE RAMPS ALL BLOCKED OFF, BUT THIS IS ALL BEING DONE TO TRY TO PROMOTE PEACE. HOPEFULLY, WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS AND WE WILL GET BACK TO THOSE PEACEFUL DAYS AGAIN. >> CHIEF, SARAH, KETV. WE HEARD IN THE PRESS ROOM EARLIER THAT THE PERSON SUSPECTED OF THE KILLING MAY HAVE HAD AN EXPIRED CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT. IS THAT A CHARGER COULD BE LOOKING INTO? IF NOT, WHY? CHIEF SCHMADERER: THE PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY AND THE MAIN ISSUE AT HAND WAS WHETHER OR NOT -- WHAT WAS GOING TO BE CHARGED AT THIS TIME, THE CHARGE OR LEVEL OF HOMICIDE. THE OTHER ISSUES WOULD LIKELY BE MISDEMEANORS, AND WE WOULD WORK ON THOSE. WE COULD STILL MAKE CITATIONS AND ARRESTS ON THAT. WE DID NOT WANT TO DO THAT BEFORE THIS MAIN ISSUE WAS ADDRESSED. THAT WAS THE FOCUS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. >> CVS. I KNOW YOU CAN’T DETAIL A LOT WHEN IT COMES TO TACTICS WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH THESE PROTESTS. IT LOOKS LIKE PEPPER BALLS AND TEAR. YOU THINK THIS WAS AN OVERREACTION AT TIMES? AND WHERE YOU THE PERSON WHO SIGNED OFF ON THIS? WHO SIGNED OFF ON THAT? CHIEF SCHMADERER: THAT QUESTION HAS BEEN ASKED A FEW TIMES, OK? I KNOW YOU HAVE NOT BEEN HERE, BUT IT HAS BEEN ASKED NUMEROUS TIMES. NO, I DO NOT FEEL THAT WE PRECIPITATED ANY VIOLENCE. THERE ARE AGITATORS THAT DO NOT NORMALLY LIVE IN OMAHA THAT HAVE CAUSED A LOT OF PROBLEMS, OK? THE TEAR GAS AND PEPPER BALL WERE DESIGNED TO MOVE AN UNRULY, UNLAWFUL CROWD, AND UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY CROWD. THEY ARE NOT USED ON ANY LEVEL OF PEACEFUL PROTEST. IF THERE IS HOPE PROTEST, WE ARE GOING TO STAND THERE AND BE SUPPORTIVE OF IT. JUST BECAUSE WE ARE ON THE OTHER LINE DOES NOT MEAN THE OFFICERS WITH THE HELMETS AND MASKS DON’T AGREE WITH WHAT IS BEING SAID. OK? WE DO. THE ISSUE THAT BROUGHT ALL THIS PROTEST ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, REALIZE THAT THE OFFICER THAT HAD A ROCK THROWN AT HIM OR A BOTTLE THROWN AT HIM, YOU ARE THROWING IT AT SOMEBODY WHO AGREES WITH YOU, OK? WE HAVE A ROLE IN SOCIETY. YOU HAVE A ROLE IN SOCIETY. YOU ARE A MEDIA PERSON. YOU HAVE A ROLE. I’M DOING MY ROLE. WE ARE TRYING TO DO THAT TO THE BEST OF HER ABILITY. THANKS. ANOTHER QUESTION? >> CHIEF, ALL THE PRIVATE BUSINESSES ARE BASICALLY CLOSED. WERE THEY GOING TO BE OPEN OVERNIGHT TONIGHT? CHIEF SCHMADERER: THEY WERE NOT ADVISED BY US TO CLOSE DOWN. REALIZE THIS JUST IS AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION OVER WHAT HAS OCCURRED NATIONALLY. IT IS AS ABUNDANT OF A CAUTION -- AS I SAID, I HAVE GREAT FAITH IN OMAHA, GREAT FAITH IN THIS COMMUNITY. >> GIVEN THE FACT THAT ALL BUSINESSES ARE CLOSED, IN EFFECT, ARE THE PROTESTERS WINNING BY DEFAULT? BY NOT DOING ANYTHING AT THE MOMENT. CHIEF SCHMADERER: THAT WOULD NOT BE THE WAY I WOULD CHARACTERIZE IT. >> HAVE YOU BEEN OUT TO ANY OF THESE PROTESTS AND TALKED TO THE PROTESTERS? CHIEF SCHMADERER: I HAVE BEEN OUT AT THE PROTEST. I HAVE MADE MY WAY OUT THERE TO OBSERVE THINGS. I HAVE TALKED WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. I HAVE ALSO SHOOKEN HANDS AND TALKED WITH MY FIRST LINE OFFICERS WHO ARE STANDING THERE DOING A VERY DIFFICULT JOB. AS CHIEF, I HAVE BEEN OUT TO THE SCENE TO BE WITH THE COMMUNITY, AND ALSO TO BE WITH MY OFFICERS THAT I AM TELLING YOU, IN MY OPINION HAVE BEEN AMAZING DURING A COMPLEX SITUATION. I THINK ANY FAIR ANALYSIS WILL SHOW THAT. ANY FAIR ANALYSIS OF THAT WOULD THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION. PAUL: PAUL GUTIERREZ, FOX 42 NEWS. THE MAYOR’S OFFICE AND THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAVE DONE AN OUTREACH TO DIFFERENT GROUPS, TRYING TO FOSTER THAT RELATIONSHIP. I KNOW YOU HAVE DONE A LOT. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORKS THAT YOU THINK COULD DO THINGS EVEN BETTER? CHIEF SCHMADERER: THERE IS. WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH 360, AND THEY ARE GREAT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO LARGE AND THEY BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER, AND IT GIVES US A GREAT OUTLET ON A WEEKLY, CONSISTENT BASIS. THAT HAS HAD STAYING POWER. VERY IMPRESSIVE. IT HAD STAYING POWER FOR YEARS. SINCE THEIR INCEPTION, CRIME HAS GONE DOWN. THE MODEL OF WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY HAS WORKED TREMENDOUSLY. WE HAVE COMMUNITIES AND GROUPS GETTING TOGETHER ALL THE TIME AND FORMING. WE GENERATE NEW PARTNERSHIPS EVERY DAY. THE ONE THING THAT I WILL SAY IT RESULTS SOMETIMES WITH THESE NATIONAL ISSUES THAT OCCUR -- WE ACTUALLY GAINED SOME PARTNERS OUT OF THIS, AND THAT IS A NICE THING TO SAY AS CHIEF. >> NOT LONG AGO, THE UNION CONTRACT FORCED YOU TO REHIRE OFFICERS YOU HAD FIRED. A LOT OF THESE PROTESTERS TALK ABOUT STRUCTURAL ISSUES. IS THAT ONE OF THEM? HOW DO WE APPROACH THAT? CHIEF SCHMADERER: I’M NOT SURE WHAT YOU ARE ASKING. THE ARBITRATION PROCESS? >> WHO YOU MAY DEEM UNFIT FOR THE POST. IS THAT A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM? CHIEF SCHMADERER: I DO NOT KNOW IF THAT IS THE MAIN ISSUE OF THE DAY, BUT SINCE YOU ASKED, LOOK. THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A REVIEW OF SOMETHING. THERE IS ALWAYS A PROCESS FOR EMPLOYEES TO HAVE THEIR ISSUES REVIEWED. RIGHT NOW, IT IS THE ARBITRATION PROCESS. I AM CERTAINLY OPEN TO ANY OPTION OF MAKING THAT BETTER, BUT THAT IS THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW, AND I DO RESPECT THAT SYSTEM, AND I DO RESPECT THAT OFFICERS HAVE TO HAVE SOME PLACE WHERE THEY CAN TAKE THEIR ISSUE TO BE REVIEWED. BUT REALIZE THIS. THE CHIEF OF POLICE SHOULD HAVE THE HIGHEST OF STANDARDS, OK? WHEN IT GOES TO AN ARBITRATION, I WOULD NOT REVIEW IT AS THE ARBITRATOR LOOKED AT THIS AND OVERRODE THE CHIEF. I WOULD VIEW IT AS I HAVE HIGH STANDARDS. AND IF THE ARBITRATORS WHO ARE NOT THE CHIEF OF POLICE HAD DIFFERENT STANDARDS THAN I DID, THEN THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. I WOULD NOT VIEW IT AS SOMETHING WAS OVERRULED OR NOT. THE SECOND PIECE IS I MADE MY POINT ON THAT PARTICULAR INCIDENT, AND I MADE IT VERY STRONGLY, AND I WOULD NOT CHANGE ANYTHING I DID ON THAT FRONT. THANKS, SARAH, FOR THAT QUESTION. >> WITH A LOT OF EFFORT BEING PLACED AROUND DOWNTOWN, IS THERE A CONCERN THAT SOME VIOLENT PROTEST MAY HAVE MOVED TO OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY? CHIEF SCHMADERER: WE WILL BE PREPARING TO RESPOND TO THAT. OBVIOUSLY, WE SET UP A CONTINGENT DOWNTOWN BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE WE HAD OUR GREATEST ISSUES A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. WE WOULD BE COMPLETELY REMISS IF WE DID NOT HAVE THAT, BUT WE WOULD ALSO BE REMISS IF WE DID NOT HAVE A CONTINGENCY PLAN IN PLACE IN THE EVENT OF PROTESTS WOULD SPRING UP ANYWHERE ELSE. IF IT DOES, IT DOES. WE ARE HERE FOR THOSE PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. WE WILL HELP YOU DO IT. THANK YOU. >> YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE MEETING WITH SOME COMMUNITY LEADERS RIGHT AFTER THIS. WHO ARE THOSE COMMUNITY LEADERS? CHIEF SCHMADERER: I’M NOT GOING TO SAY BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS A PUBLIC LIST YET. OUT OF RESPECT FOR THEM, I AM NOT WHEN TO SAY THIS AT THE MOMENT. OK, I’M GOING TO DO ONE MORE QUESTION, IF YOU HAVE GOT ONE. ABSOLUTELY. >> I JUST WANTED TO BRING UP AGAIN THAT IF THERE ARE ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT POLICE MISCONDUCT, CHIEF SCHMADERER TAKES IT SERIOUSLY. HE INVESTIGATES. HE HAS DISCIPLINED. HE HAS TERMINATED. THAT IS HIS JOB. HE DOESN’T ACCORDING TO WHAT HE BELIEVES IS RIGHT. I HAVE SEEN HIM DO IT MANY, MANY TIMES, AND I KNOW HE WILL DO IT MANY, MANY TIMES AGAIN. HE TAKES IT SERIOUSLY, AND HE WILL DO THAT. THE ARBITRATION SYSTEM IS SET UP TO BE LIKE AN APPEALS BOARD. EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO DO THAT, TO SAY I DON’T AGREE WITH THIS. BUT LIKE I SAID THE OTHER DAY, THERE IS EVEN ANOTHER LAYER BE PUT IN PLACE, AND THAT IS THE CITIZEN COMPLAINT REVIEW BOARD. IF CITIZENS FILE A COMPLAINT AND DON’T AGREE WITH THE DECISION THE CHIEF MADE, THERE IS THE EXTRA LAYER OUT THERE THAT THEY CAN GO TO THE CITIZEN COMPLAINT REVIEW BOARD AND SAY THEIR ISSUE AND CONCERNS. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION IS THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE TODAY BY DON KLEINE, THE COUNTY ATTORNEY, IS HIS DECISION AND ONLY HIS DECISION. I WANT TO REEMPHASIZE WHAT THE POLICE CHIEF SAID. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT GATHERS ALL THE EVIDENCE, AND THEY GATHER THE EVIDENCE THEY HAVE AT THE TIME. THEY GIVE IT TO THE COUNTY ATTORNEY. IT IS HIS POSITION TO CHARGE PEOPLE WITH CRIMES. IT IS NOT THE MAYOR OF OMAHA. I HAVE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF EMAILS TODAY SAYING, MAYOR, OVERTURN THIS. DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN. FILE THESE CHARGES. I HAVE NO AUTHORITY AND NO JURISDICTION WHATSOEVER TO CHARGE ANYONE WITH A CRIME. I NEVER HAVE AND I NEVER WILL. THAT IS WITH THE COUNTY ATTORNEY. THE COUNTY ATTORNEY IS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHO REPORTS TO THE CITIZENS. THAT IS HIS POSITION. A MISDEMEANOR MAY GO TO OUR CITY PROSECUTOR, AND HE IS THE ONE THAT MAKES THE DECISION. THERE IS THOSE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT, AND I HAVE NO RIGHT OR NO JURISDICTION TO OVERRIDE THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. THE CHIEF ALSO. IF THERE IS A CHARGE, IT COMES FROM THE COUNTY ATTORNEY. THIS CASE COULD STILL BE OPEN, AS FAR AS OTHER CHARGES. I HEARD JUSTIN WAYNE IS THE ATTORNEY FOR THE FAMILY NOW. I HEARD HIM SAY IN A PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF VIDEOS OUT THERE. IF THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF VIDEOS OUT THERE, BRING THEM IN. LET THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SEE THEM. LET THEM INVESTIGATE THOSE. ANYBODY AT THE SCENE, LET THEM COME FORWARD. LET US KNOW. THERE ARE OTHER CHARGES OUT THERE THAT STILL COULD BE MADE. WE WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT. IT IS NOT THAT THIS IS JUST DONE TODAY. IF THERE IS MORE EVIDENCE COMING IN, IF THERE IS MORE CRIMES THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED, WE NEED TO KNOW THAT, AND THE INVESTIGATION WILL CONTINUE.

1622520142,2020-06-01 13:52:36,LIVE AT 1:30PM -- Douglas County attorney planning news conference; dozens arrested on protest-related charges this weekend,https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/Omaha-protests-Police-report-more-than-100-arrests-after-Sunday-night-curfew-570925571.html,en,False,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"No charges will be filed in the death of 22-year-old James Scurlock against the business owner who fired the fatal shot Saturday night in the Old Market. Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine begins his news conference responding to the death of James Scurlock on Monday afternoon, June 1, 2020. (WOWT) 6 News learned of the news minutes before Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine's planned media conference at 1:30 p.m. Monday in legislative chambers. Attorney Justin Wayne, who is acting as representative of Scurlock's family but is also a Nebraska State Senator, spoke afterwards on behalf of the family. Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, and Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer held a news conference afterward. Stothert shared condolences to Scurlock's family and friends. She said the past few days have been some of the darkest in Omaha's history. ""A lot has happened and his death has been very sad to all of us,"" she said. Ricketts said the level of disruption and chaos in both Omaha and Lincoln has not been seen in recent memory. ""Disruption has led to violence and the tragic loss of James Scurlock,"" he said. Ricketts offered thanks to peaceful protesters and law enforcement among other groups. He said Scurlock's death is a tragedy -- violence in response to Kleine's decision not to file charges is not the answer. ""When the curfew comes, please go home. Protest peacefully, then please go home. Any violence detracts from the memories of the people who are lost,"" he said. Ricketts said he believed in Kleine's decision not to prosecute. Schmaderer too offered condolences. He said the night of May 30 was hectic and there were many people in the area of 12th and Harney Streets before, during and after the shooting. ""The role of the police department is to investigate and present evidence to the county attorney who will then make the charging decision. We know there were people in the area who have not been identified. So get with us and come in for an interview,"" with homicide detectives, Schmaderer explained. He explained a small group from outside the community is to blame for the problems during protests Friday and Saturday. ""The Minneapolis incident has caused further strain nationwide,"" he said in regards to the relationship between minority communities and law enforcement. Last week, he and other high-ranking members of the department issued a statement condemning the actions of the now-former Minneapolis officer who is charged with killing George Floyd. Schmaderer said audio portions of what was said between Scurlock and Jake Gardner is missing. Gardner was identified by Kleine earlier Monday as the one who shot Scurlock. Asked about enforcing order Monday night, Schmaderer said a multi-agency contingent of officers is on hand. ""Let's remember who Omaha was several days ago before national events took over... Omaha was a community that made great strides in police-community relations,"" he said. Douglas County attorney announcement In his update Monday afternoon, Kleine said the shooting death of Scurlock was senseless, and he showed video clips obtained from nearby businesses of the shooting. ""One of the troubling things... is there is a lot of misinformation about this case in particular,"" he said. Kleine described the events leading up to and including Scurlock's death from video evidence and witness accounts. Scurlock and others could be seen speaking with the business owner in front of The Hive Saturday night after one of the members of the group had shoved the man's father to the ground. The man, who Kleine initially did not name but later confirmed was Jake Gardner, is seen backing away from the group and Scurlock, asking them to leave him alone and not to damage his business. Gardner lifted his shirt to display a handgun in his waistband. The group attacked Gardner and they fell into a puddle on the street in front of the bar. Gardner grabbed his gun and fired two shots, which caused one member to run away from Gardner. Scurlock was seen tackling Gardner from behind while Gardner was trying to stand. Gardner later told police Scurlock had him in a chokehold and witnesses said they heard Gardner say ""Get off me"" several times. Gardner fired one shot which struck Scurlock in the collarbone. He died after being taken to Nebraska Medical Center. ""The bar owner was interviewed with lawyers present. He said the first shot was a warning shot. He said Scurlock jumped on him and he was scared Scurlock was going to take his gun. He fired in self-defense. He was scared he would lose his life or severe bodily injury,"" Kleine said. Gardner was in police custody from Saturday night to Sunday night at Omaha Police Headquarters. ""He has shown he has a gun. He made it clear he was armed. He said when someone was on top of him that they said they were going to kill him,"" Kleine said. He added Gardner appeared remorseful, scared and shocked when he was interviewed by investigators. He said they usually do not release the name of individuals who are not being charged by the office, but confirmed the business owner was Jacob Gardner. Scurlock family response A few minutes after Kleine finished answering questions about his announcement Monday, Wayne responded on behalf of the Scurlock family saying it was disappointing that the county attorney met with community leaders about the decision not to press charges before telling Scurlock's father. ""In this community, we prosecute black and brown individuals a lot more for things like we just watched,"" Wayne said. ""(Gardner) had an unlawful carry concealed weapon."" Kleine said Gardner had a carry concealed weapons permit but it was expired at the time of the shooting. He said the facts of the case described by Kleine were ""a credibility issue"" but that is decided by a jury, not a judge. Wayne asked for a grand jury to be formed. ""We watched a video where anybody else would have gotten charged with something,"" he said. ""We are asking for a grand jury and charges to be brought against (Gardner)."" More than 100 arrested after 8 p.m. curfew Saturday After several warnings to disperse and abide by the 8 p.m. curfew Sunday, dozens were arrested following the third night of protests in Omaha — the second in the Old Market area of downtown — according to an OPD report released Monday morning. Preliminary estimates put Sunday night's arrest count at around 130, according to an Omaha Police report. Of the 46 failure-to-disperse charges, only six people were older than age 29 and only one was in his 40s, the records state. Of the 67 ""mayor-emergency"" charges, 13 were older than age 29, and 2 were in their 40s, the document states. Other charges included obstructing officers, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, unlawful assembly, and carrying a concealed weapon, the records state. By comparison, 21 arrests were made during Friday night's protests at 72nd & Dodge; and 51 arrests were made Saturday following protests at two main locations in the city. — TWEETS: WOWT 6 News breaking news team",0.0

Or Participate In It',https://www.kios.org/post/former-president-obama-lets-not-excuse-violence-or-participate-it,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"Former President Barack Obama said the protests in cities across the nation in the aftermath of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis under a police officer's knee ""represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system in the United States."" But he wrote in a post Monday on Medium that the ""the small minority of folks who've resorted to violence"" at many demonstrations are ""putting innocent people at risk, compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause."" He recounted seeing an interview, where he said, ""I saw an elderly black woman being interviewed today in tears because the only grocery store in her neighborhood had been trashed. If history is any guide, that store may take years to come back. So let's not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."" The country's first African American president weighed in after the nation experienced a sixth night of protests — which in some cities turned violent — following the death of Floyd, a black man, after being kneeled on by at least one Minneapolis officer, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The Democrat, who often admonishes people to vote, said that ""we should be fighting to make sure that we have a president, a Congress, a U.S. Justice Department, and a federal judiciary that actually recognize the ongoing, corrosive role that racism plays in our society and want to do something about it."" But he wrote that the officials ""who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system"" work at the state and local levels. Mayors and county executives, Obama wrote, appoint police chiefs and negotiate with police unions, while district attorneys and state's attorneys ""decide whether or not to investigate and ultimately charge those involved in police misconduct."" All are elected positions, Obama said, which usually suffer from ""pitifully low"" voter turnout, ""especially among young people — which makes no sense given the direct impact these offices have on social justice issues, not to mention the fact that who wins and who loses those seats is often determined by just a few thousand, or even a few hundred, votes."" Obama established a task force on ""21st-century policing"" in 2014 after Michael Brown's shooting death by police in Ferguson Mo., which led to violence there. Many police and criminal justice reforms outlined by Obama and his Justice Department have been abandoned during the Trump administration. President Trump has called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" and urged state and local governments to take aggressive action to quell any violent unrest. ",0.0

During these hours, the only people permitted to be out of their homes are those who are going to work, seeking medical attention or seeking the assistance of law enforcement. The curfew is in response to the violence this weekend after peaceful assemblies to protest the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota were disrupted by a small group of individuals, resulting in injuries, destruction of property, and arrests. The mayor discussed this weekend’s protests and the curfew at a news conference on Monday. The mayor considered the Sunday's curfew a success because more people went home sooner in the night. There was less violence and vandalism than seen in Lincoln overnight Friday and Saturday. Gaylor Baird said, “The peaceful protests are making important calls for social justice, for the safety of all Americans, and for a recognition by all that black lives matter.” She said that these are important messages for everyone to hear and to catalyze each of us to make a difference in achieving a more just and peaceful world. The Mayor said peaceful protests have been hijacked by bad actors and agitators. ""We saw continued engagement with law enforcement officers, but less property damage and crowds dispersed by 12:30 a.m."" LPD Chief Jeff Bliemeister said 53 people were detained on Sunday night and 39 have since been released. Those cited will be brought to the city’s attorney’s office for review. A Lincoln Journal Star reporter was temporarily detained, though released after his credentials were identified. According to the mayor, DHMs now allow for bars to be open as of June 1. However, those bars would still be affected by the curfew. The Mayor did apologize to the bar owners of Lincoln who would be affected by the curfew. “There can be no comparison made between the grief of our community over the senseless death of countless people of color and the economic impacts that are felt by those whose livelihoods have suffered, first by the pandemic and now by the destruction and vandalism. But we are nonetheless, committed to doing everything we can to minimize suffering, including economic suffering.” The Mayor discussed her hopes to increase conversations with the community. She said there are current plans to make the Citizen Police Advisory Board more accessible. Currently, it is required to place these complaints in person at the Mayor’s office, however officials are working to expand the language so that online filing of complaints can be made. If people have complaints about law enforcement's actions in Lincoln, they can be filed in person at the Mayor's office, or by emailing cpab@lincoln.ne.gov.",0.0

Chauvin and the other three officers who took part in the arrest of Floyd, who was suspected of passing a counterfeit bill, were fired Tuesday.

1622603247,2020-06-01 15:51:05,Family autopsy: Floyd asphyxiated by sustained pressure,https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/Family-autopsy-Floyd-asphyxiated-by-sustained-pressure-570929471.html,en,True,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A medical examiner on Monday classified George Floyd’s death as a homicide, saying his heart stopped as police restrained him and compressed his neck, in a widely seen video that has sparked protests across the nation. Protestors line the intersection of 72nd and Dodge on Friday, May 29, 2020, in Omaha to protest the death of George Floyd on Monday night after a Minneapolis Police officer knelt on his neck. (Emily Dwire / WOWT) “Decedent experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s),” the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said in a news release. Cause of death was listed as “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.” Under ""other significant conditions” it said Floyd suffered from heart disease and hypertension, and listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. Those factors were not listed under cause of death. A Minneapolis police officer was charged last week with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, and three other officers were fired. Bystander video showed the officer, Derek Chauvin, holding his knee on Floyd’s neck despite the man's cries that he can't breathe until he eventually stopped moving. A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family also called his death a homicide. It concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression, said the family’s attorney, Ben Crump, who called for the charge against Chauvin to be upgraded to first-degree murder and for three other officers to be charged. He didn't say what the charges against the other officers should be. That autopsy, by a forensic pathologist who also examined Eric Garner’s body, found the compression cut off blood to Floyd’s brain, and that the pressure of other officers' knees on his back made it impossible for him to breathe, Crump said. Both the medical examiner and the family’s experts differed from the description in last week’s criminal complaint against the officer of how Floyd died. The complaint, citing preliminary findings from the medical examiner, listed the effects of being restrained, along with underlying health issues and potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system. But it also said nothing was found “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” Neither side has released its full autopsy report so far. The family's autopsy found no evidence of heart disease and concluded he had been healthy. Floyd, a black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died after Chauvin, who is white, ignored bystander shouts to get off Floyd and Floyd's cries that he couldn't breathe. His death sparked days of protests in Minneapolis and around America. The complaint provided no details about intoxicants. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller described the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Floyd’s family and attorneys, like the families of other black men killed by police, commissioned their own autopsy because they didn’t trust local authorities to produce an unbiased report. The family's autopsy was done by Michael Baden and Allecia Wilson. Baden is the former chief medical examiner of New York City, and was hired to do an autopsy of Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. Baden also did an autopsy at the family's request for Michael Brown, an 18-year-old shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri. He said Brown didn’t reveal signs of a struggle, casting doubt on a claim by police that a struggle between Brown and the officer led to the shooting. Dr. Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist from the San Francisco Bay area who blogs about the subject and is not connected with the case, said the key difference between the medical examiner's conclusions and those of Baden and Walker are the official finding of “significant” conditions for Floyd, including heart disease and drugs in his system. Baden and Wilson acknowledged on a conference call with reporters that they didn't have access to the tissue samples that the medical examiner kept that might have given more information on his health. Nor did they have their own toxicology results yet. Melinek said it's not unusual for different pathologists to reach different determinations, given that they may be looking at different information and that they've had different experiences and training. Under the law, a medical examiner determines the cause and manner of death, but it's up to prosecutors to decide whether criminal charges are warranted. The term homicide means only that a person's death was caused by another person. Chauvin, who was also charged with manslaughter, is being held in a state prison. The other three officers on scene, like Chauvin, were fired the day after the incident but have not been charged. The head of the Minneapolis police union said in a letter to members that the officers were fired without due process and labor attorneys are fighting for their jobs. Lt. Bob Kroll, the union president, also criticized city leadership, saying a lack of support is to blame for the days of sometimes violent protests. When asked to respond, Mayor Jacob Frey said Kroll's opposition to reform and lack of empathy for the community has undermined trust in the police. Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that Attorney General Keith Ellison would take the lead in any prosecutions in Floyd's death. Local civil rights activists have said Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman doesn't have the trust of the black community. They have protested outside his house, and pressed him to charge the other three officers. Freeman remains on the case. ___ Associated Press writer Doug Glass contributed.

I would hope that the they understand that we’re doing our job to the best of our ability in looking at the evidence and the law and that’s all we can do,” Kleine said. Scurlock's father, who is also named James Scurlock, said he hopes authorities will continue investigating his son's shooting death and call a grand jury to review the evidence. “What I want is justice, not a quick answer. This was a quick answer,” Scurlock said. Following the shooting, which took place amid a second night of violent protests in Omaha when windows were smashed at numerous businesses, officials imposed a curfew on Nebraska's largest city, and national guard troops were mobilized to help police. Tear gas was again used to disperse a crowd of protesters after curfew Sunday night in Omaha, but there were few problems with vandalism and violence. Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert urged protesters to remain peaceful. “The incident that happened up in Minnesota, it fractured relationships not only here but all over the country ... But now it is time to heal those fractures. The violence that we saw here doesn’t help anybody,"" Stothert said. Floyd, who was black and was handcuffed, died after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, used his knee to pin down Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. Chauvin and the other three officers who took part in the arrest of Floyd, who was suspected of passing a counterfeit bill, were fired Tuesday. Chauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter charges, but the other three officers haven’t been charged. Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place.

At least one protester in Tampa, Florida, is known to have COVID-19. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who expressed dismay last week about Floyd's death, tweeted Monday that five of his officers were exposed to the protester, whom he did not identify.

As businesses re-open, it will be difficult to figure out whether someone caught the virus at a protest or in some other encounter, Mina said. Hopefully, the fact that protests are taking place out of doors, will dilute the virus and reduce disease transmission, he said. Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit."" There is historical precedent to suggest that viruses can be spread by large public gatherings. In September 1918, people in Philadelphia held a parade to celebrate the return of soldiers from World War I. The gathering of 200,000 people, crammed shoulder to shoulder, reignited a deadly flu epidemic, leading to massive closures and thousands of deaths, records show. Yet, there's a public health cost to not protesting the status quo, said Dr. Hillary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and immediate past president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. ""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said. She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said.

At least one reveler at the lake party tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Camden County Health Department. Others were advised to monitor for symptoms. Babcock said it is possible to minimize the risks of protesting, with masks, social distancing and asking sick people to stay home. Arresting people and putting them into close contact with others increases risk, Babcock said, as does spraying protesters with pepper spray, which causes violent coughing and can potentially spread the virus. Timeline: George Floyd protests: How did we get here? Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency room physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, said there is risk of longer-term effects in communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Wen was Baltimore's health commissioner when protests erupted following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray.

I'm Terry Gross. Like so many Americans and people around the world, I was horrified watching the video of the police officer - now charged with manslaughter and third-degree murder - who had his knee on George Floyd's neck for over eight minutes, keeping the weight on Floyd's neck even after he died. My heart was broken. It was broken again over the weekend as I watched peaceful protests against the death of Floyd and other black men and women who died at the hands of police become violent confrontations in cities around America, including Philadelphia, where I live, and Brooklyn, where I grew up. Philadelphia has been preparing to allow businesses that were closed due to the pandemic to reopen this Friday. Now in the heart of our business and shopping district that also has medical offices, food markets, pharmacies and many apartments, stores have had their windows broken, been looted, some set on fire and destroyed. Just a few days ago, the streets were pretty empty, with people practicing social distancing. By the weekend, in Philly and cities around the country, thousands of people were in the streets, which public health officials fear could lead to a surge in cases of COVID-19. We asked Eric Adams to join us because he has insights about this moment from several perspectives. When he was 15, he was arrested and beaten by police. He later became a police officer with the intent of helping to reform the police. In 1995, he co-founded the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care to work from within the NYPD against police brutality and racial profiling. After serving on the force for 22 years, retiring as a captain, he served in the New York State Senate for seven years. He was elected Brooklyn borough president in 2013 and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn's CEO. Brooklyn has been a pandemic hot spot and the location of large protests, some of which turned violent. Eric Adams, welcome back to FRESH AIR. We're recording this late Sunday afternoon. We don't know what will happen Sunday night. What are your concerns about the actions of the police and the protesters in Brooklyn? ERIC ADAMS: Many levels, Terry. I have mixed emotions. No. 1, I'm extremely excited and pleased to see our young people taking to the streets. Historically, the winds of change, they have always been blown by young adults. Young people are very much a part of the movement. And we're seeing that they are lifting their voices. And so I'm happy to see that, but I'm also concerned because embedded into a righteous movement is a group of well-trained people who - their goal is not police abuse but disruption. They're trained on incendiary devices, how to make them. They're trained on how to agitate. Some of them are carrying firearms. And if we're not careful, they will hijack this righteous movement, and that alarms me and concerns me. GROSS: Who do you think those well-trained people are and who do you think trained them? What do you know about that? ADAMS: It's a combination. Some of them, believe it or not - this strange marriage has been created between right-wing militias who have infiltrated the bodies of some of these movements across our country and even here in New York, and others are those who are just believers that we need to burn down our cities. I know that they had groups here staking out the city to see how police move and where police are located. I've been debriefed on some of the people who have been involved. Like, one car we found in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, had several Molotov cocktails and a tank full of gasoline to make incendiary devices. The young lady who pulled up at the 88th Precinct, what happened to have been one of my precincts as an officer, she pulled up and threw a Molotov cocktail at a police vehicle. We're seeing jeeps burned and vans burned. And the young African Americans who are fighting police abuse all across the country, they are doing it in a peaceful fashion. And if we're not careful, those who have infiltrated these peaceful, righteous groups are going to put these young people in a very harmful state. GROSS: What's your reaction, as a former police officer, to seeing police precincts in Brooklyn under attack? I mean, protesters tried to breach and enter a police precinct in Brooklyn, and outside Brooklyn's 88th Precinct, there was another large clash with crowds. What's your reaction to that? Like, how do you think police should be handling it when their precincts come under attack? ADAMS: And that's so important because look at the last series of marches that really put in place serious changes across the country. When you looked at those marches, you did not see people go into the 88th Precinct and other precincts in this city; you saw the organizers, the marches, you saw them stop businesses, stop traffic, maybe stop transportation. They were doing die-ins. They were doing real things to allow their voices to be heard. And that's why we have to ask, what's different here? How did we go from those extremely important ways of being heard to a point that we are actually trying to take over precincts, that we're firebombing vehicles? I was out last night at 1:30 in the morning on Flatbush Avenue and saw the number of businesses that were destroyed. And as I went into Clinton Hill, I saw property owners, people who actually own homes, I saw their homes damaged as well. And so we must make sure that we have the right balance between public protection from our police officers and to weed out those who are damaging what these young people are doing. I've been speaking with the Black Lives Matters organizers of Brooklyn and others who are part of the righteous pursuit to end police brutality to show them how to distance themselves from those who are trying to hijack their movement. GROSS: Would you like to see people from Black Lives Matter speaking out against the violence and distancing themselves from it? ADAMS: Yes, I would. And that is part of the conversation that I've had with some of the leaders. And I understand their concerns because they don't want to give a pathway. Sometimes when you speak out against something, it's manipulated in another fashion, and so they are extremely concerned about that. And we're trying to find a way that they can effectively distance themselves from what they're seeing but, at the same time, keep the focus on the mission of turning around police abuse. But I guess I would like to do that, and that is part of the conversations I've been having with them. GROSS: And let's get back to the police. I know - like, because we talked about this once before on the show - when you were a police officer, there were times when, during the day, you would be joining protesters against police abuse, and then in the evening, you'd be policing the protesters in your job as a police officer. And people would make assumptions about you as an officer, assumptions that were often not true, about where your sympathies lay. So let's talk about policing right now. I suspect that a lot of police officers sympathize with the protesters, yet at the same time, cannot allow violence in their cities. They can't allow the destruction of property, although all of that has happened anyways. Talk a little bit from your perspective as a former police officer what you think the police are up against and the kind of difficult decisions they have to make. ADAMS: That's a great question because - and you're right. The - remember; we recruit police officers from a society that is filled with healthy and toxic individuals. And when you come into the law enforcement arena, many of the individuals who are not suitable to be a police officer, they find root in a culture that really protected even the toxic individuals. The police department - actually, the police departments across America - they have never been good at immediately weeding out those who are not suitable. To have two of the most important rights that a human being can have in a country like America - the right to take freedom and the right to take away one's life - those are rights that not even the president - thank God, with this president - a president doesn't even have. So when you give someone those rights, you need to have an awesome amount of oversight, an awesome amount of obligation, and we have not done that historically. And when you look at the video footage - I've been closely watching the video footage, and I've been - I have intentionally went to many of the protests last night. I was - like I said, I was on Flatbush Avenue watching some of the interaction. When you look at the video footage, there's something that is glaring. There is a body of officers who are really suited to do this type of enforcement, and then there's a body of officers that are really not suited to do it. Now, what do I mean by that? And, Terry, we really need to reexamine how we assign police officers in our country. Everyone who is in the occupation is not suitable for every role in the occupation. There are officers that I, as a platoon commander, I enjoyed having with me when I had to kick in a door to go after someone that was committing a crime, had a gun. But I wouldn't want that same person with me if I was speaking to someone that was trying to talk someone off a ledge or dealing with a hostage situation. And so we don't assign officers based on their abilities to carry out the crafts that are needed in a particular time. Policing basically just brings everyone together. Saying, if you have on a blue uniform, you're suitable to do all the jobs - that is a big mistake, and we need to change that. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams. He's the borough president of Brooklyn. He's a former New York City police officer who co-founded 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, which was a police reform group against racial profiling and police assaults. He was also assaulted by the police when he was 15. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. If you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams, and we're talking about the protests over the weekend. At age 15, he was beaten by police. And in the hope of helping reform the policing of black people and neighborhoods, he joined the New York City police and, after 22 years, retired as a captain. He became a state senator in New York and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn Borough president, the CEO of Brooklyn. Brooklyn has been a site of large protests against the death of George Floyd in police hands. It's also been a hot spot in the pandemic. Were you ever, as a police officer, patrolling a protest that turned violent? And if so, what was that like for you? What were some of the most complicated actions and decisions you had to make? ADAMS: Extremely complicated, extremely frightening. Even when you put on a blue uniform, you do not take away the fright and flight hard-wiring inside you. And the goal is I go in with the mindset - or whoever I'm working with, I'm asking them before I start it - as a football team goes into a huddle, I go into a huddle and say, listen; we are our brother's keeper. That was the No. 1 thing I told my officers at several protests. I was here in the midst of many of the stop-and-frisk protests, the Abner Louima protest, the Dorismond protest - some of the real height - and I policed under Giuliani's administration and under Bloomberg and Commissioner Kelly. We had protests all the time. What I learned was that if you make sure that the officers know that you are my brother's keeper and if I am going over the edge, if I'm not doing the job the way it's supposed to because my adrenaline is flowing and I am responding instead of being the professional I ought to be, stop me, pause me, pull me to the side, take me, disengage me. And there were times when a person was extremely difficult to deal with - in some cases violent dealing with them - that you have to do the necessary force to terminate the condition. What you're seeing in some of the videos, you're seeing people handcuffed, and officers are still swinging their baton, and no one is stopping them. We're not teaching de-escalation. We teach de-escalation of the person who's committing the act; we're not teaching de-escalation of the officers who are trying to terminate the act. And I always instructed my officers when I was a sergeant, a lieutenant and a captain the skill of de-escalation and being your brother's keeper to prevent an incident getting out of hand. GROSS: We've all seen in times during the protests over the weekend when protesters were intentionally provoking the police - throwing things at them, setting their cars on fire. From your perspective as a former police officer who opposes police brutality, who opposes racial profiling, who opposes these murders of black people, what is the response a police officer should have when they are intentionally being violently provoked? ADAMS: It's so important. And my history - this is my life's work, dealing with police abuse, from being arrested as a young man, being told by civil rights leaders to go into the police department. I'm committed to having effective policing, but I'm also committed to something else. I'm committed to public safety. And in those cases where you see police vehicles being burned, where you see rocks being thrown, those people should be immediately apprehended and arrested. And we have to be swift about it, and we have to be - have a zero-tolerance. So that zero-tolerance of not allowing police to be abusive must also be a zero-tolerance not to allow people to attack police because that uniform is not the person in the uniform; it's the symbol of our stability. I know it has been a symbol of pain, but it also has been a symbol of the stability of this country and this city. And we need to reform it, but we can never tear down that stability that we use. So I don't go - I'm not part of that group that says disband the police departments. I'm not part of that group that says we can live in a society with no police at all. You do need some form of law and order and not unlawfulness and disorder. GROSS: Let's talk about what happened to you when you were 15 and that - how that affected your view of the police. I mean, you had been charged with trespassing. Just give us a brief sense of what the charge was. ADAMS: I was a 15-year-old child. I grew up - part of my childhood was in Bayside High School, when I left Brooklyn before returning. And my brother and I, we were arrested for criminal trespassing. Once the officers took us to the precinct - they picked us up from school, took us to the precinct. And they were filling out the paperwork, and out of nowhere, they said, you feel like a beat down? And they brought the two of us - we thought we were being transported somewhere. But they took us to the lower part of the 103rd Precinct, the same precinct Sean Bell was killed in. And they just started kicking us in the groin, you know, repeatedly. It was unbelievable. I remember acting like I passed out to get them to stop. The pain was just excruciating, if you can only imagine. And we - you know, I know I urinated blood for a week after that. And I remember every day saying to myself, Terry, that, you know, I'm going to tell my mother if it doesn't stop after the next day, the next day. And eventually, it concluded. And we never talked about that, my brother and I, until we were adults. And I think until this day, he still is suffering from mental health illness because of that because I experience PTSD. I could not see a police car go by without reliving that moment. I could not see a police show on TV. Every time I heard a siren - can you imagine just having that part of the wiring in your brain? And I think oftentimes police officers that have bad intentions do that to young people to - almost like slave masters used to do horrific things to instill fear into slaves. And it wasn't until after Randolph Evans was shot and killed that a group of leaders in Brooklyn from the Black United Front told me and 13 others to go into law enforcement. I didn't want to do that. I was a computer programmer. I wanted to open my own firm and become Cisco qualified. But I felt obligated, and it really was a life-changing experience for me, and it allowed me to turn that pain into purpose. And you know what? I finally found the refuge I needed, that I no longer felt the trauma from that beating. I felt as though that demasculation (ph) was behind me because I was using that pain in a way of turning around the lives of people. GROSS: So you're in a position of understanding the pain that a lot of black people feel when they think about the police. Were police ever a good force in your life before you became an officer? Did they ever help you or protect you? ADAMS: No. And it's unfortunate that there was always this adversarial relationship with law enforcement. And remember - you know, you don't call the police in South Jamaica, Queens, or Brownsville or East New York to invite them to a party; you call them when someone shot up the party. So when you have a relationship with an entity in your community that is only built on when there is something terribly wrong, you begin to associate pain with the profession. And so that is why proactive policing is so important in changing - how we utilize our law enforcement community is so important because I didn't have those good stories that some of my colleagues - when I attended Bayside High School and I used to hear - some of the students in the class talked about the good things they did, you know, with the police, how some of them were in the Boy Scouts or was part of the DARE program and just these interactions. And I was like, what are you talking about? They're cops. Who - (laughter) you know, who has these relationships with cops? And it was difficult because there was nothing, no point of reference of the beauty of having a good relationship with your law enforcement in your community. GROSS: My guest is Eric Adams, a former NYPD police captain. In 1995, he co-founded the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care to work from within the NYPD against police brutality and racial profiling. He now serves as Brooklyn bureau president. We'll talk more after a break. And then later, Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel by Brit Bennett, whose first novel, the bestseller ""The Mothers,"" was optioned by Kerry Washington. And David Bianculli will review three TV shows, one from the new streaming service HBO Max. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DARRELL GRANT'S ""FILS DU SOLEIL (FOR TONY WILLIAMS)"") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Eric Adams. At age 15, he was beaten by police. In the hope of helping reform the policing of black neighborhoods, he joined the New York City Police and, after 22 years, retired as a captain. He became a state senator and is now serving his second term as Brooklyn borough president, the CEO of Brooklyn. Brooklyn has been the site of large protests against the death of George Floyd in police hands. Brooklyn is also a hotspot for the pandemic. You know, I really do think there's a lot of police officers around the country who are really angry and really furious about what happened to George Floyd. And they're probably suffering too because now they're out on the streets in the middle of a pandemic fighting with people that they don't want to be in confrontation with. What do you think police can do or should do to show their anger at police who behave badly or brutally, or who are, you know, responsible for the deaths of people? ADAMS: We have to really change the culture of policing. We have police here in the city that put up a white power finger sign. And all the other police officers started cheering and laughing with them. When you have some of the actions of - we almost have to rebuild our law enforcement community because the recruitment effort we did, we focus on law enforcement, again, and not on how we deal with social issues - and build this symbiotic relationship between our policing community. And then you have to change the culture of really supporting a climate, a healthy climate, where an officer could come forward and report abuse without any form of reprisal. We must refocus and revamp police. And I think this is an opportunity to do so, as we saw in New Jersey some of the police chiefs marching with some of the demonstrators. And something else happened with the Floyd case that some people may have overlooked - it was a significant moment - one, the expeditious fashion in which the police officer was fired, second, how fast the prosecutor indicted. Now, the indictment itself is troubling to me, which is another conversation. But they moved quickly. The third - the other officers were fired. They should also be arrested. But the mere fact they were fired was a cosmic shift in policing, because the tone is now set that your actions will also - you're responsible for not only for your actions, but the actions of the person who you are near. Standing around watching someone choke to death, you should be held accountable the same way as someone participated in a robbery. They acted in concert. That is how we should treat those officers that are carrying out these actions. GROSS: I know a lot of people would agree with you that there's been, you know, progress made in how fast these actions were taken. But that doesn't seem to have had any effect on the protests. ADAMS: And it shouldn't. We have to keep the pressure on. We have a long way to go. And I am - as I stated, I'm excited about these protests because it is as though I've come full circle. I've marched in these protests when we were fighting against stop-and-frisk. I remember looking beside me and seeing these different ethnic groups who peacefully joined with me. I recall that the - in the protests, as you indicated, taking off my jeans and shirt and putting on my police uniforms and feeling as though my day was fulfilled. I felt accomplished. I felt as though I was able to protect the city and, at the same time, force them to allow our police agencies to become who and what they are. And I think these protests play a significant role, because let's face it, a absence of the Dr. Kings, the SNCCs, the Rosa Parks and so many others, America would not have moved in the area that it should have moved. We would've never signed civil rights bills. We would have never done some of the things that we did. If it wasn't for the women's suffrage movement, we would still probably not have women voting. Hitting the streets and showing you're outraged and not comfortable is something that's part of America as apple pie and Chevrolet. And we need to continue to hit the streets to move America where it ought to go. GROSS: Right now, given how hot the situation is, do you want to see people continuing to hit the streets? ADAMS: It's a very delicate balance. I'm really afraid about the COVID-19. As you know, I spent the last 50-plus days sleeping in my office from the time that COVID hit the shores here in New York City. And what we have done around this issue - and the same communities that are dealing with police abuse are the communities that were negatively impacted disproportionately by coronavirus. And so I'm afraid that many of our young people are going to take the infection home to their loved ones, their seniors, their grandmothers. And it is a true concern. And when I saw people participating in the protest, I did see some who were wearing face mask. But clearly, an overwhelming number of them were not practicing social distancing. I am concerned that, you know, body fluids, being in close proximity is going to have family members that are going to be infected. Young people who are going to leave the protests and go home, they are going to infect their loved ones. And COVID virus is serious, is real. And the same communities that are dealing with police abuse were disproportionately impacted by the lack of government response to coronavirus. GROSS: I'm obviously really worried about that, too. And, you know, Brooklyn has been a pandemic hotspot. And, you know, in Philly, Philly's preparing to reopen on Friday. Philly was preparing to go yellow. And now, like, who knows what the consequences for the pandemic will be from all the protests over the weekend? And I'm sure that's true for many cities. Like, we know what happened in New Orleans after Mardi Gras. And this was not a celebratory parade. These were protests. But it's still, in terms of the virus, it can have the same impact of thousands of people in the streets, shoulder-to-shoulder. Many of them were wearing masks. But at that close proximity, you know, who knows? How much of a setback do you fear this will be for Brooklyn, where you are the Brooklyn borough president? ADAMS: I think it's going to be a significant setback. But what I've learned - I recall after 9/11. And when the Trade Center was attacked and the buildings collapsed, I remember going out to Brownsville, a predominately black community, to talk to the young people and deal with the trauma of the buildings collapsing. And they were playing basketball and just hanging out. And I've told them, did you hear what happened? They said, Eric, we were catching hell when those buildings were up. We didn't have heat at night. We had lead paint. Crime was high. We were unemployed. Those buildings have nothing to do with us. People can feel so much pain that they become numb to the reality of danger. And I think that's what you're seeing here. Many of these young people have been living in a state of just total hopelessness and don't feel as though another level of trauma is going to do anything to dissipate the trauma that they're experiencing already. And somehow, we have to convince them that life is not about being hopeless, but about being empowered. And while we do that, we have to understand that that is why they are in the streets, not because they want to expose themselves to coronavirus. But they've reached a level of desperation where they're no longer believing society's ability to protect them from a virus or from the virus or police abuse. GROSS: Were you glad over the weekend that you are no longer a police officer? ADAMS: No, not at all. I looked forward to being in the eye of the storm. I looked forward to those difficult days when I had to talk someone down from showing a level of anger and understanding what they felt. I was the type of person that I wanted to be the platoon commander that was inside of - in charge of the detail that went out. I knew we were going to allow officers to come back safely. And I knew that the protesters were going to get home safe. And that's the type of leadership we need right now. And I think that in the police department, we have some amazing men and women who have taken upon this occupation. We need to start rewarding them for their commitment - and not only looking at how good they are at fighting crime, but how good they are at building relationships within the community. GROSS: Eric Adams, thank you so much for talking with us. And I hope Brooklyn comes through all of this OK. ADAMS: OK. Be well. GROSS: Eric Adams is the Brooklyn borough president and a former NYPD police captain. He co-founded the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care. After we take a short break, Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel by Brit Bennett, whose first novel was the bestseller ""The Mothers."" This is FRESH AIR.

1622664431,2020-06-01 14:39:00,Biden Meets With Black Faith Leaders In Delaware Following Days Of Protest,https://www.kios.org/post/biden-meets-black-faith-leaders-delaware-following-days-protest,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"In his first in-person campaign event in more than two months, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden met Monday with community leaders at a predominantly African American church in his hometown to address the outrage and protests surrounding George Floyd's death. Protests have erupted in dozens of cities over the past week since Floyd, a black man, died after a police officer was seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck for minutes on end. ""I think the public is getting to a place that it's never been before in understanding a lot of this,"" Biden said at the event. ""But it's going to take a whole hell of a lot of hard work. A lot of hard work. But I'm confident it can be done."" Fourteen faith leaders and local lawmakers attended the event at Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Del., as they donned masks and sat seated two to a pew to help maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus. Biden spent more than half of the event listening to the concerns of community leaders rather than delivering remarks. He could be seen taking notes as each attendee got up and spoke. Despite being in a room full of supporters, the group offered critical feedback to the former vice president, with some saying the black community didn't get the economic boost it needed under the Obama administration and that Biden's role in passing the 1994 crime bill makes some young black voters skeptical of him. There were recommendations to create a czar dedicated solely to the study of police brutality within Biden's first 100 days as president. Several speakers urged Biden to pick an African American woman as his vice president. U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., spoke emotionally of a recent exchange she had with a 23-year-old protester in Wilmington, who told her he was ""willing to die."" ""He said, 'I have so much rage.' And I said, 'How old are you? What's your name? How old are you?' And I just tried to hold him, COVID or not,"" the congresswoman said. After about an hour, Biden rose to address the church gathering. ""I want to make something clear: I don't expect anything from the black community,"" he said. ""It has to be earned, earned every single time."" Biden said he's spent time speaking with black thought leaders about how to move forward as a country and said people who ""don't think of themselves as having a prejudiced bone in their body"" are now reckoning with the discrimination endemic in some American institutions. ""The Band-Aid's been ripped off by this pandemic and this president. No one can pretend any longer what this is all about. Nobody can pretend who has been carrying us on our backs — it's the minorities,"" Biden said. Biden listed specific plans for his would-be administration, including heightened federal oversight over local law enforcement, additional training for police officers and increased economic opportunity for African Americans. He teased the announcement of a new economic proposal in the coming weeks, which he said will have a strong emphasis on housing, education and access to capital. ""The ultimate answer for every other group has been access to economic opportunity,"" Biden said. ""What is the future? The future is you gotta be able to get out of bed and think, 'I can make it, I can do something. The deck's not completely stacked.' "" He also stressed what he characterized as a critical need to change leadership in the Senate, particularly as it relates to confirming federal judges. ""If we don't win back the United States Senate, we're going to be in real trouble,"" Biden said. ""Presidents come and go. But I tell you what, justices don't. They last a long time."" The event ended with a prayer and Biden saying he'll rely on the group for advice throughout his campaign. ""I know I'm going to make mistakes,"" he said before quoting the expression, ""What comes from the heart goes straight to the heart."" ""It's going to come from the heart. But I'll need help,"" the former vice president said. ""I need help and advice as we go along as to what you think I should and shouldn't be doing."" The event marked Biden's third public appearance in a week, his first trips away from his home since mid-March. He has been campaigning from his house due to coronavirus lockdown orders. Biden left his home on Memorial Day to lay a wreath at a veterans park near his home, and on Sunday he visited a site in Wilmington where protesters had gathered the night before in response to Floyd's death. Biden held a virtual meeting with mayors later in the day and had virtual fundraisers planned for Monday evening. ",0.0
1622664426,2020-06-01 15:38:00,Attorney General Steps Up Federal Law Enforcement Response To Protests,https://www.kios.org/post/attorney-general-steps-federal-law-enforcement-response-protests,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"Attorney General William Barr is sending specialized teams of federal agents to help control protests in Washington, D.C., and Miami, and the FBI is setting up command posts in cities across the country as demonstrations against George Floyd's death move into a second week. Barr has directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to dispatch riot teams to the nation's capital and to Miami to assist local authorities in responding to protests there, according to a senior Justice Department official. The attorney general also sent an FBI hostage rescue team to help authorities Sunday in Washington with demonstrations, the official said, adding that the federal law enforcement presence will be ""maximized"" in the city on Monday evening. The moves come as protesters continue to take to the streets in cities across the country in outrage and grief over Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis while in police custody. Video of Floyd's arrest shows him handcuffed and pinned facedown on the street. A Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, is shown kneeling on top of him with his knee pushing on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Barr has called the outrage over Floyd's death ""real and legitimate"" but said the criminal justice system must be the venue to hold those responsible to account. And he argues that is already happening. Chauvin and three other officers involved have been fired from the police force. Minnesota authorities also have charged Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter. On a parallel track, the FBI and Justice Department are conducting a separate investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated. Some of the protests against Floyd's death have turned violent and destructive. Shops in Washington, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and elsewhere have been looted, burned and destroyed. Police stations and police vehicles have been attacked. It is unclear at this point who exactly is behind the violence, but Barr and President Trump put the blame squarely on what they have labeled far-left radicals and extremists. ""Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements,"" Barr said over the weekend. ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda."" He said that in many places, the violence appears to be driven by ""anarchistic and far-left extremists, using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence."" It is unclear what Barr meant by ""antifa-like tactics,"" and he did not offer any evidence to support his assertions. A Justice Department official later said it was based on information provided by state and local authorities. On Sunday, the president went a step further and threatened to designate antifa a terrorist group, although experts said there is no legal authority that allows a domestic entity to be labeled a ""terrorist organization."" On top of that, antifa, short for anti-fascist, isn't an organization but rather a diffuse movement of activists on the far left. While Barr and Trump have put the blame on them, some state authorities, such as Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, have blamed white nationalists. He, too, did not offer evidence to support his assertion. For now, state and local police and other authorities are leading the law enforcement response to the protests. They make the arrests, although the FBI is conducting interviews to determine whether any federal laws — such as crossing state lines to conduct violence —have been violated. ",0.0

Jake Gardner, the owner of two Old Market cocktail bars was released from jail last night, Kleine said. In making the decision Kleine said his office spent all of Sunday reviewing evidence collected by the Omaha Police Department including video and audio taken during the incident late Saturday night as well as interviews with the suspect. Kleine said in order to charge Gardner, his office would have to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not acting in his own self defense. Video surveillance from Gardner’s bar The Gatsby at 1207 Harney Street showed Gardner was pushed into a puddle on the street by two individuals. Gardner then fired a “warning” shot with his right hand. When Scurlock jumped on him, putting Gardner into a chokehold, Gardner asked several times for Scurlock to get off of him, Kleine said. When Scurlock did not, Gardner switched the gun to his left hand, fired behind him and struck Scurlock once in the right clavicle. Advertisement Gardner had lifted his shirt showing the gun to the group including Scurlock, which had minutes prior broken the windows to his business, The Hive. Gardner’s permit to carry a concealed weapon had expired. After the decision, Scurlock’s father, James Scurlock II, said the decision was rushed and not made with an acceptable amount of evidence. “We can’t keep allowing things like this to go,” he said. “And just give it a slap on the wrist and give it an excuse and say I did my job.” State Sen. Justin Wayne, who is representing Scurlock’s family said this decision shows a clear double standard about who the county attorney’s office considers credible. He said the next step is to try and invoke a grand jury but is also exploring civil lawsuits. “There needs to be somebody else who listens to the facts and makes that determination of credibility, and it happens every day in that courtroom,” Wayne said. Advertisement Kleine repeatedly referenced Gardner’s interview with Omaha police following the incident. In those statements, Gardner said he felt like his life was in danger and that Scurlock was trying to wrestle the gun away from him. When asked whether the County Attorney’s Office considered that Scurlock and others were acting in their own defense, Kleine said the evidence they had showed Gardner believed his life was in serious danger. In a 3:45 p.m. press conference with Mayor Jean Stothert and Gov. Pete Ricketts, Omaha Chief of Police Todd Schmaderer said today’s announcement was about whether to charge Gardner with homicide. Additional charges, including not having a concealed carry permit which is a misdemeanor, can now be investigated. “We didn’t want to do that before this issue was addressed,” he said Wayne and Kleine both asked if anyone has additional eyewitness testimony or video evidence that they submit it. Wayne said he felt Kleine’s office made their decision too quickly and on too little evidence. At the 1:30 p.m. press conference, Kleine showed two videos of Saturday night’s incident. Cellphone footage caught by one person and the bar surveillance footage built the bulk of the county attorney’s office evidence. The footage appeared to show people shoving a man that Kleine identified as Gardner’s father. Gardner then asked who shoved and hit his dad. Minutes later Gardner was pushed to the ground and started firing. Audio of Gardner asking Scurlock to get off of him was not shared with the press. Kleine said he made at least a few pleas before shooting. After the press conference, many businesses downtown had already boarded up their windows. Police had also blocked off several roads and were directing traffic. Mayor Jean Stothert said she understands this decision will cause harm to the city’s relationships with different communities. Over the last eight years she said the city and police force have made gains in building those relationships. “Hopefully we will get through this and we will get back to those peaceful days again,” Stothert said. When asked whether Schmaderer regrets any actions taken by police over the last few days he said no. Many Omaha police officers and other responding agencies have the same opinions as the protesters, he said, but they’re doing their jobs by quelling the crowds with tools such as tear gas and pepper bullets. With the arrival of the National Guard and now the decision not to press charges in the shooting death of Scurlock, many protesters’ trust in the government has lessened even further. But Schmaderer said regardless of emotion and tensions, police will operate in the same fashion tonight. “We all have roles, do you not, you’re a member of the media,” Schmaderer said to one reporter at the press conference. “I’m doing my role and I’m trying to do it to the best of my ability.” While Kleine said he had not spoken to Gardner, interviews with Omaha police showed the business owner was shocked and remorseful about the actions. Wayne said one of the worst tragedies of this experience moving forward is the family can’t even hold a funeral to mourn the loss of their son and brother. The Scurlocks are a family of two parents, 10 kids and many more cousins. To hold a funeral, even with immediate family, would break public health mandates. But even as they find ways to grieve, Wayne said they are focused on next steps—finding new evidence and new eyes to examine it.",0.0

The police force has cited concerns around the spread of coronavirus. The rally has been held each year since 1990 to commemorate the crackdown on June 4, 1989 in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Chinese military opened fire on Chinese citizens who were calling for economic and democratic reforms. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil, told the South China Morning Post that alliance members still planned to enter Victoria Park to observe a moment of silence that night. The alliance also asked the public to join an online gathering and light candles across the city. NPR's Emily Feng reported that the move to deny the demonstration comes amid controversy surrounding a Chinese proposed national security law that could limit Hong Kong's autonomy. The potential law has concerned pro-democracy advocates, and as Feng noted, ""legal scholars question whether Beijing has the authority to impose this law on Hong Kong."" In justifying an earlier extension of restrictions to June 4, the police cited a lingering threat of spread of the coronavirus, The Guardian reported. ""Police believe the event will not only increase participants' chances of contracting the virus, but also threaten citizens' lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others,"" police said, according to the newspaper. Lee Cheuk-yan, who chairs the alliance that organized the event, told the South China Morning Post that he believes the government was using the pandemic to shut down the demonstration. ""We believe this is totally unreasonable and unscientific, because everything is normal in Hong Kong. They are just using this excuse to suppress our rally,"" Cheuk-yan said, adding that many other facilities had already reopened. ",0.0

Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One — Derek Chauvin — has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits."" : 6/03/20 A previous version of this Web story incorrectly said all four police officers present at the death of George Floyd are white.

AILSA CHANG, HOST: The viral video that sparked nationwide protests this weekend captured an individual tragedy - the death of a black man at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. But George Floyd's death is set against a backdrop of economic inequality that has long shadowed race relations in this country. We're going to talk about that now for a few minutes with NPR's Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So we've been hearing an enormous amount of frustration in the last week about yet another black man dying in police custody. Can you just break down for us how economics plays into that frustration? HORSLEY: There is certainly frustration with the deadly tactics of police. But there's also frustration about the underlying circumstances that in the richest country on Earth, a man could lose his life because he's suspected of passing a counterfeit 20-dollar bill. We know that African Americans are worse off than whites in this country by almost every economic measure. Andre Perry, who studies race and inequality at the Brookings Institution, says that means blacks in general are more vulnerable to any kind of economic downturn. ANDRE PERRY: Black folk live in communities where a single economic shock can really send the entire economic hopes astray. HORSLEY: And, of course, right now, we're all living through a giant economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. CHANG: Right. HORSLEY: People throughout the country are on edge. And that has just added more dry kindling to the woodpile where this match has landed. CHANG: Well, about the pandemic - I mean, we know that African Americans have suffered disproportionate health problems during this entire outbreak. But economically, how are they faring, relatively speaking, during this time? HORSLEY: Not well. Of course, workers of all races have seen a spike in unemployment during the pandemic. The black unemployment rate has jumped into double digits, as have other rates. But the black-white gap hasn't gotten noticeably worse during the last couple of months. CHANG: Interesting. HORSLEY: We do know, however, African Americans who are working are more likely to be in essential frontline jobs. And that puts them at greater risk of infection. CHANG: So how does Minneapolis, where this all started, stack up when it comes to inequality or when it comes to discrimination? HORSLEY: The racial divide in Minneapolis is pretty stark both in terms of income and homeownership. In fact, the gap between white and black homeownership in Minneapolis is one of the largest in the country. And that matters because for a lot of families, owning a home is the main building block of wealth and stability. If blacks aren't able to buy homes, they're missing out on an important stepping stone. Nationwide, African Americans did make some gains in homeownership in the '90s and early 2000s. But those were really wiped out by the subprime mortgage crisis. And Andre Perry says that kind of structural inequality feeds into the frustration of the people who are protesting George Floyd's death. PERRY: That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters. It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities. HORSLEY: Now, Perry notes these demonstrations are taking place five months before a national election. And he says this is a good opportunity for policymakers to talk about how they see policing and how they would address these longstanding economic challenges. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0
1622680110,2020-06-01 17:49:00,Protests Over Racism Versus COVID-19 Risk: 'I Wouldn't Weigh These Crises Separately',https://www.kios.org/post/protests-over-racism-versus-covid-19-risk-i-wouldnt-weigh-these-crises-separately,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"Mass protests that have erupted over police brutality toward black people in America are raising concerns about the risk of spreading the coronavirus. But some health experts, even as they urge caution, said they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat. Tens of thousands of people, masked and unmasked, have thronged the streets of Minneapolis, Atlanta, Louisville, Ky., and other cities in the week since George Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. They are the largest public gatherings in the U.S. since the pandemic forced widespread shutdowns, and many local officials warned of a possible spike in new cases in one or two weeks. ""Risk of transmission is lower in open spaces, but wherever there is a gathering there is still the risk of transmitting the virus,"" said Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. Health experts urged protesters not to sing and shout to reduce the threat of person-to-person transmission. And they cautioned that police tactics such as tear gas and pepper spray could exacerbate the situation by prompting people to cough and gasp for air. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a list of tips for demonstrators to lower their risk of contracting COVID-19, such as covering their faces and staying in small groups. ""Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead,"" the department advised. Nsoesie said that while she agrees with the sentiment, ""I can see how some of these tips can be difficult to follow. For example, if you are angry or frustrated about an issue, you want to express that feeling, and speaking is one way of doing that."" She added, ""It's also hard to keep 6 feet of distance at a protest."" Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she's worried about how consecutive days of protests could trigger an influx of COVID-19 cases. Huge demonstrations began in the nation's capital on Friday — the same day Bowser lifted stay-at-home orders and eased shutdown rules. The city is still limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people. But in the streets around the White House, that cap is regularly exceeded by orders of magnitude. ""I'm so concerned about it that I'm urging everybody to consider their exposure if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested, because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve,"" Bowser said on NBC's Meet the Press. But the risks of congregating during a global pandemic shouldn't keep people from protesting racism, according to dozens of public health and disease experts who signed an open letter in support of the protests. ""White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,"" the letter said. Initially written by infectious disease experts at the University of Washington, the letter cited a number of systemic problems, from the disproportionately high rate at which black people have been killed by police in the U.S. to disparities in life expectancy and other vital categories — including black Americans' higher death rate from the coronavirus. ""Data is showing that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in many states,"" said Nsoesie, who was not among the letter's signatories when NPR contacted her. ""Racism is one of the reasons this disparity exists."" She continued, ""Racism is a social determinant of health. It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn't weigh these crises separately."" Local governments should not break up crowded demonstrations ""under the guise of maintaining public health,"" the experts said in their open letter. They urged law enforcement agencies not to use tear gas, smoke and other irritants, saying they could make people more susceptible to infection and worsen existing health conditions. The medical professionals also acknowledged the potential for COVID-19 cases to rise in the days to come, and they called for public health agencies to boost access to care and testing in affected communities.

1622684248,2020-06-01 17:54:29,"With rare candor, employees protest Facebook’s Trump policy",https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/With-rare-candor-employees-protest-Facebooks-Trump-policy-570933401.html,en,True,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"Facebook employees are using Twitter and Facebook's internal communications tools to register their frustration over CEO Mark Zuckerberg's decision to leave up posts by President Donald Trump that suggested protesters in Minneapolis could be shot. Twitter flagged and demoted Trump's tweet about the protests when he used the phrase “when the looting starts the shooting starts.” Facebook has let it stand, and Zuckerberg explained his reasoning in a Facebook post Friday. “I know many people are upset that we’ve left the President’s posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,” Zuckerberg wrote. Angry demonstrations have spread across the U.S. over the past week, creating some of the most widespread racial unrest since the 1960s. The protests, which have been met by violent police action in many cities, were spurred by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned to the pavement by an officer who put his knee on the handcuffed man's neck until he stopped breathing. Trump's comment evoked the civil-rights era by borrowing a phrase used in 1967 by Miami’s police chief to warn of an aggressive police response to unrest in black neighborhoods. On Monday, dozens of Facebook employees staged a virtual “walkout” to protest the company's decision not to touch the Trump posts according to a report in the New York Times, which cited anonymous senior employees at Facebook. The Times report says dozens of Facebook workers “took the day off by logging into Facebook’s systems and requesting time off to support protesters across the country."" Workers also expressed frustration in other ways, including posting on Twitter, speaking to managers and writing on Facebook's internal communication network. Though virtual, this was the first time that Facebook workers have staged a walkout in the company's history. Employees at the social media giant have been less outspoken than their counterparts at other tech companies such as Google and Twitter. “I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we’re showing up. The majority of coworkers I’ve spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard,” tweeted Jason Toff, a director of product management at Facebook who's been at the company for a year. Toff, who has a verified Twitter account, had 131,400 “likes” and thousands of retweets of his comment. He did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Monday. “I don’t know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable. I’m a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark’s decision to do nothing about Trump’s recent posts, which clearly incite violence. I’m not alone inside of FB. There isn’t a neutral position on racism,” Facebook design manager Jason Stirman tweeted. Stirman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Sara Zhang, a product designer at the company, tweeted that Facebook's “decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe. The policy pigeon holes us into addressing harmful user-facing content in two ways: keep content up or take it down.” “I believe that this is a self-imposed constraint and implore leadership to revisit the solution,” she continued. Zhang declined to comment to The Associated Press. “We recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community. We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership. As we face additional difficult decisions around content ahead, we’ll continue seeking their honest feedback,” Facebook spokeswoman Liz Bourgeois said in a statement Monday. Facebook moved a weekly employee question and answer session with executives to Tuesday from this coming Thursday to respond to workers' concerns. Late Sunday, Zuckerberg again posted on Facebook, pledging a $10 million donation to racial justice groups. But he made no mention of Trump's posts. Instead, he highlighted Facebook's role in the spreading of the video of Floyd's death. “We need to know George Floyd’s name. But it’s clear Facebook also has more work to do to keep people safe and ensure our systems don’t amplify bias,” Zuckerberg wrote. Twitter has historically taken stronger stances than its larger rival, including a complete ban on political advertisements that Twitter announced last November. That’s partly because Facebook, a much larger company with a broader audience,targeted by regulators over its size and power, has more to lose. And partly because the companies’ CEOs don’t always see eye to eye on their role in society. Over the weekend, Twitter changed the background and logo of its main Twitter account to black from its usual blue in support of the Black Lives Matter protesters and added a #blacklivesmatter hashtag. Facebook did the same with its own logo on its site, though without the hashtag. Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0
1622684244,2020-06-01 17:54:58,Barr: Law enforcement must ‘dominate’ streets amid protests,https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/Barr-Law-enforcement-must-dominate-streets-amid-protests-570932831.html,en,True,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"U.S. officials vowed to “maximize federal law enforcement presence” in the nation’s capital Monday night after days of violent demonstrations led to fires across Washington and left scores of businesses with broken windows and dozens of police officers injured. Vehicles for the District of Columbia National Guard are seen outside the D.C. Armory, Monday, June 1, 2020, in Washington. Protests have erupted across the United States to protest the death of Floyd, a black man who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25. (Source: AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) In a call with governors, President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr also encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country following the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations have turned violent in several cities, with fires ignited in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The comments from Trump, Barr and other federal officials appeared aimed at avoiding similar scenes Monday night, when protesters were expected to gather again. But there were also questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Barr told the state leaders that law enforcement officials must ""have adequate force"" and ""go after troublemakers."" ""Law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets,"" Barr said. Trump said he was ""taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America."" The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. ""Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,"" Trump said. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" Trump directed Barr to ""lead federal law enforcement efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia,"" Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said. Minutes before Trump spoke Monday evening in the Rose Garden of the White House, police and members of the National Guard took aggressive action, using tear gas and flash bangs, to move back peaceful protesters who were outside Lafayette Park, across from the White House. Law enforcement officials had made a decision earlier Monday that they needed to extend the security perimeter around the White House after multiple fires broke out in Lafayette Park the night before, according to a law enforcement official who would not publicly discuss the security protocols and spoke on condition of anonymity. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked whether Barr was involved in the decision to use tear gas on protesters outside the White House. A U.S. Park Police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized. The Justice Department deployed the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops in Washington on Sunday. By midnight, Barr had ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, to the streets of the nation's capital, a senior Justice Department official said. Barr has also directed the federal Bureau of Prisons to send teams of prison riot officers to patrol the streets in Miami and Washington, the official added. The federal prison system had also implemented a temporary measure to further curtail inmate movement at prisons across the U.S. ""to ensure the good order and security of our institutions, as well as ensure the safety of staff and inmates,"" the Bureau of Prisons said. Barr was traveling around Washington on Monday night to observe the protests, according to the senior Justice Department official, who would not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was also sending officers, agents and aircraft around the country to assist other law enforcement agencies ""confronting the lawless actions of rioters,"" the agency said. The officers were being deployed in several states, though the official declined to provide specific details, citing security concerns. Several major cities have enacted curfews, and District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser set a 7 p.m. curfew for Monday and Tuesday. Violent demonstrators ignored the 11 p.m. curfew the night before as they set buildings and trash cans on fire and broke into stores to steal items from the shelves. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other ""anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The FBI is using its network of regional joint terrorism task forces to ""identify criminal organizers,"" and federal prosecutors across the country have been instructed to share information and utilize federal riot, arson or terror statutes against any ""violent radical agitators"" who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the ""violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups"" as domestic terrorism. Although there isn't a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. The FBI has already started questioning rioters who were arrested in several cities to determine whether they committed any federal crimes, the senior Justice Department official said. It is a federal crime to cross state lines to participate in violent riots. Between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states — Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Utah — are being sent to D.C. to provide assistance, senior Defense Department officials said. Those troops are either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. In addition, officials said that soldiers from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Drum, New York, were heading to D.C. and would be based outside the city in case they are needed. They would be prepared to respond, but the officials said they are hopeful those troops will not be needed. If they are sent in, they are not expected to be conducting any law enforcement. The officials declined to say how many active-duty troops were en route. In addition, members of the Army's 3rd Infantry Regiment, an active-duty unit known as the Old Guard and most visible as the unit that stands at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, have been called up to protect Fort Myer, Virginia, the U.S. Army post adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery. The officials said some of the National Guard in D.C. will be armed and others will not. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing military deployments. ___ Associated Press writers Lolita C.

Captain Jim Duering, Grand Island Police Department, attributes that partially to an open dialogue between themselves and the protest organizers. ""It's important that the people in the Midwest are showing everyone else in the nation what it's suppose to look like, how you get your message out to be heard and really make an impact,"" Duering said. People started protesting around 7 p.m. Sunday on Locust Street in Grand Island. They held signs reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No Justice No Peace."" Organizers told GIPD their plans for the evening. Officers stayed nearby in case they had any issues. While hundreds of protesters marched to Pioneer Park for a moment of silence honoring George Floyd, who died while in police custody last week, police directed traffic and responded to any trouble from outside parties. ""We're more than happy to offer our assistance so people can practice their first amendment rights, as long as they're doing things the right way,"" Duering said. Organizers said they were very grateful for police assistance. Duering said they invite more communication between law enforcement and the public.

OPD Deputy Chief Ken Kanger said police asked protest leaders that if both sides took a knee, that protesters would comply with the order and leave peacefully. (WOWT) Omaha Police Deputy Chief Ken Kanger was cautiously optimistic around 9 p.m., noting that the night wasn't over. ""We had some compliance with the mayor's order at 8 o'clock,"" he said. Kanger said there was a lot of communication happening, and gestures of goodwill from the officers. ""It was strong that the officers took a knee with them,"" he said. ""...Sometimes they think because we don't take a knee, that we're not understanding or that we don't agree that what happened in Minneapolis was inappropriate; but we also understand that we have a job to do.""

WARNING: Some videos paired with this article, which may at times include livestream coverage, contain explicit language. Some pepper ball was used on protesters, Kanger said. OPD also made two gun-related arrests, and maybe a dozen or more arrests, he said. ""There was a lot of emotion today,"" he said. ""There were some folks in the crowd that had tears in their eyes."" The protesters asked to march, Kanger said. Sometimes the perception is that the police are trying to control the group, but that's not the case, he said.

President Donald Trump departs the White House to visit outside St. John's Church, Monday, June 1, 2020, in Washington. Part of the church was set on fire during protests on Sunday night. (Source: AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he doesn't believe the federal government can send military troops into his state. He accused the president of creating an ""incendiary moment"" by threatening to do just that to quell violence that has arisen as demonstrators have taken to the streets in reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. ""I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois,"" Pritzker said on CNN after Trump urged governors to deploy the Guard. If they did not, he said he would send in ""thousands and thousands"" of soldiers. Pritzker was among the first governors to react to Trump's comments, which came hours after the president called governors ""weak"" and urged them to take a more aggressive response to weekend violence. It came as Americans gathered to protest police brutality against black Americans following the killing of Floyd, who was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with people breaking into and stealing from businesses, smashing car windows and setting fires. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not deployed the state's National Guard to New York City, although he said earlier Monday the state had 13,000 troops that ""we can use at any moment."" ""I say thank you but no thank you,"" Cuomo said on CNN about Trump's call to send military troops to the states. At least 23 states and the District of Columbia had already deployed guard troops as of Monday morning, according to a statement from the National Guard. It wasn't clear whether the action would be enough to satisfy the president. Trump took no questions from reporters and did not say how he would decide whether a state's response was sufficient. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has activated the state's guard, said in a statement he prays ""no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit."" ""This president has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office,"" Inslee said in a statement. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat, said any suggestions the state's National Guard is ill equipped to handle the states needs is ""misinformed."" ""As the Commander In Chief of the Nevada National Guard I can state, categorically, that they have done their duty to protect all Nevadans, and will continue to do so."" In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of demonstrators. She refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler's request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation, but on Monday activated 50 unarmed guard members in support roles. ""You don't defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,"" Brown, a Democrat, said earlier Monday in reaction to Trump's comments about governors being weak in their response. ""Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform."" She didn't immediately comment on Trump's remarks about deploying the U.S. military. Nor did California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has deployed thousands of guard troops to Los Angeles and other cities. He called Trump's morning comments ""noise"" and avoided addressing them directly, although he said the nation is desperate for leadership. Guard members can assist law enforcement and perform duties such as traffic control, communications support and extinguishing fires. __ Associated Press writers Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington, and Michelle Price in Las Vegas contributed to this report.

And once again, protesters refused to go home. A powerful moment Monday night when Nebraska State Patrol Major Mike Jahnke knelt on the steps of the State Capitol with a protesters for nine minutes, a tribute to George Floyd. (Source: Nebraska State Patrol) However demonstrations for the most part were peaceful Monday night. Lincoln Police had a less visible presence than Sunday night. Instead of standing in front of the County/City Building in face shields and riot gear, law enforcement were inside watching through the windows. Officers also had cruisers parked a distance away. Around 9:35 p.m. the group marched back towards the State Capitol building where the protest began. 10/11's Ellis Wiltsey said someone threw a water bottle towards the Hall of Justice so the crowd decided to leave because they wanted to keep protests peaceful. This is the fourth straight night of protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. This group was smaller than Sunday's protest, but still comprised of hundreds of people. The group chanted ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot"" as they marched down the middle of O Street with signs and megaphones. Earlier in the evening Lincoln Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird could be seen talking with several protesters in front of the Hall of Justice.  During our 10 p.m. newscast, we asked the Mayor if she was okay with protesters violating curfew. ""Well, for everyone’s safety, I would love for them to be home in their households. Where they won’t be potentially co-opted by the bad-actors who we’ve seen show up at their peaceful protests the last couple of nights. We imposed a curfew to keep the peace; they are being peaceful, we are okay with them continuing to get their message out. But we want them to be safe. We know there is a pandemic as well, and having large gatherings is something that can jeopardize everyone’s safety. We hope they are keeping mindful of that, but we know their message is important. And we want to hear their message and we do hear their message loud and clear.""  Around 10:20 p.m. Nebraska State Patrol Major Mike Jahnke was seen kneeling in front of the State Capitol building with a protester. 10/11's Abbie Petersen was there and said they knelt together for nine minutes to symbolize the nine minutes the Minnesota police officer had his knee on George Floyd's neck. Around 11 p.m. most of the protesters went home, however a small group of people followed by vehicles started walking on O Street taking up both eastbound lanes. The group made their way to Target on N. 48th Street where a disturbance occurred. Officers deployed tear gas to get the crowd to disperse and were seen arresting people near 44th and O Streets.",0.0

My fellow Americans, my first and highest duty as president, is to defend our great country and the American people. I sworn oath to uphold the laws of our nation, and that is exactly what I will do. All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that for George and his family justice will be served. He will not have died in vain, but we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protesters to be drown out by an angry mob. The biggest victims off the rioting are peace loving citizens in our poorest communities. And is there President? I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you. I am your president of Law and Order and an ally of all peaceful protesters. But in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, riders, antifa and others. A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents. Innocent people have been savagely beaten, like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street or the woman in upstate New York viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed. New York's finest have been hit in the face with bricks. Brave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct has been overrun. Here in the nation's capital, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War Two Memorial has been vandalized. One of our most historic churches was set ablaze. A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero, was shot and killed. These air not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against God. America needs creation, not destruction. Cooperation, not contempt. Security, not anarchy. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos. This is our mission, and we will succeed 100%. We will succeed. Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America. I am mobilizing all available Federal resource is civilian and military to stop the rioting and looting to end the destruction and arson and to protect the rights of law abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights. Therefore, the following measures air going into effect immediately. First, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now. Today. I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard insufficient numbers that we dominate the streets. Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington, D. C. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement offices to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property. We're putting everybody on warning are seven oclock curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I want the organizer's of this terror to be unnoticed, that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail. This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence. One law and order and that is what it is. One law. We have one beautiful law and once that is restored and fully restored, we will help you. We will help your business and we will help your family. America is founded upon the rule of law. It is the foundation of our prosperity, our freedom and our very way of life. But where there is no law, there is no opportunity where there is no justice, there is no liberty. Where there is no safety, there is no future. We must never given to anger or hatred. If malice or violence reigns that none of us is free. I take these actions today with firm resolve and with a true and passionate love for our country. By far our greatest days. Lie ahead. Thank you very much. And now I'm going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. Thank you very much. Advertisement GOP senators critical of President Trump's response to unrest following Floyd's death Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: President Trump vows to deploy U.S. military if states can't control violent protestsTop GOP senators are calling on President Donald Trump to take a far more compassionate approach amid the deep unrest following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, raising concerns that the president's handling of the crisis so far threatens to divide a badly bruised nation further.""I think the country is definitely looking for healing and for calm, and I think that's the tone the president needs to project when talking about what is happening around the country,"" Senate Majority Whip John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, told CNN. ""I think he needs to strike a tone that fits the level of frustration country's experiencing right now, and I hope in the future, he'll do that.""Thune added that Trump's tweets about the situation have been ""not helpful.""Sen. John Cornyn, also a member of Senate GOP leadership, told CNN that ""I think it's important"" for Trump to offer more of a unifying message in the midst of the deep unrest across the county.""I presume at some point he will address the nation,"" said Cornyn of Texas. ""If I were advising him I would say we need it sooner rather than later.""At a time when Trump could be consoling the nation, Republicans — who rarely break from Trump — are voicing their disapproval that the president has offered little in the way of condolences and instead taken to Twitter to incite divisions and cast blame.""Some of his tweets have not been helpful,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said at a news conference Monday. ""It would be helpful if he would change the tone of his message.""The message from his own party comes as protests have grown and spread throughout the country from Los Angeles to Washington.""We are obviously in a divisive situation right now that is escalating. ... He needs to make more unifying comments,"" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia.Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, speaking on the Senate floor, called on Trump ""to help heal the racial division.""""The president should help to heal the racial divisions in this country,"" Collins said. ""It is at times like this that a president needs to speak to the nation, to pledge to right wrongs and to calm inflamed passions.""Asked later if she thinks the president needs to offer a unifying message, Collins said: ""I do.""Sen. Cory Gardner, who like Collins is facing reelection next year, didn't criticize Trump directly but added: ""We all have to do better every day — we have to.""On Friday, the president's handling of the situation came under more scrutiny after he tweeted, ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase that originated from controversial Miami police chief Walter Headley at the height of the civil rights movement. Headley, who defended practices like using police dogs and force, said at news conference ""We don't mind being accused of police brutality,"" according to an article from the period in The New York Times.""Those are not constructive tweets without any question,"" Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate, told Fox on Sunday. ""I will say this, I spoke with the president (Saturday) morning, and he and I had a good conversation about the next steps. I told him, what I am going to tell you. I told him 'Mr. President, it helps us when you focus on the death, the unjustified in my opinion, the criminal death of George Floyd.'""On Monday during a private call with governors, the president continued to blast others for what has unfolded, accusing some states of being weak and arguing that law enforcement needed to ""dominate"" protestors in order to contain the demonstrations in cities across the country.""You have to dominate or you'll look like a bunch of jerks, you have to arrest and try people,"" the president told the governors in a call from the basement White House Situation Room, according to an audio recording of the call obtained by CNN.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn't answer questions Monday about whether he believed Trump had struck the appropriate tone in his handling of the unrest. Others also declined to comment about Trump's tweets, including Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, who faces voters in the fall.""Well, obviously this is an evolving situation — I think this is a difficult position the president is in,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida when asked if Trump should shift his tone to emphasize unity. On Monday, McConnell demonstrated a starkly different tone from the president from the floor of the Senate.""In no world, whatsoever, should arresting a man for an alleged minor infraction involve a police officer putting his knee on a man's neck for nine minutes while he cries out 'I can't breathe' and then goes silent,"" McConnell said. ""To me, to a great many of my fellow Kentuckians and to many outraged Americans, these disturbing events do not look like three isolated incidents, they look more like the latest chapter in our national struggle to make equal justice and equal protection of the law into facts of life for all Americans.""",0.0

Pete Ricketts on Monday expressed dismay over the level of ""disruption and chaos"" in Lincoln and Omaha over the weekend, which he said was a ""terrible one"" not seen in recent memory. He pleaded for people to reject violence as they exercise their rights to peaceful protest. Ricketts was referring to the thousands of people demonstrating Friday and Saturday nights following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week from what an independent autopsy said was asphyxiation from sustained pressure. A white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes as the African American man told him he couldn't breathe. The Lincoln and Omaha protests over the killing of Floyd ""right there on the street,"" started out as peaceful, he said at a news briefing, but were hijacked by people who wanted to cause harm. Peaceful protests were about the ""very real issues that face minority communities about black people's access to justice and how they're treated by law enforcement. ""Justice must be served for George Floyd,"" Ricketts said. ""And to the folks out there who are hurting, we hear you."" Those who protested peacefully took an important issue and treated it with the dignity it deserved.",0.0

It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke.Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. Biden also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.”Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid March.His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.”Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.”Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer.Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans' memorial near his Wilmington home, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd.In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke.“The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer.Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.”Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in.Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now.“I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”",0.0

There is no hierarchical structure to antifa or universal set of tactics that makes its presence immediately recognizable, though members tend to espouse revolutionary and anti-authoritarian views, said Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers University and author of ""Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook."" ""They do different things at different times in different ways, some of which there is evidence of them breaking the law. Other times there is not,"" Bray said. Literature from the antifa movement encourages followers to pursue lawful protest activity as well as more confrontational acts, according to a 2018 Congressional Research Service report. The literature suggests that followers monitor the activities of white supremacist groups, publicize online the personal information of perceived enemies, develop self-defense training regimens and compel outside organizations to cancel any speakers or events with ""a fascist bent,"" the report said. People associated with antifa have been present for significant demonstrations and counter-demonstrations over the last three years, sometimes involving brawls and property damage. They mobilized against a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 and have clashed repeatedly with far-right groups in Portland, Oregon, including at a protest and counter-demonstration last summer that resulted in arrests and the seizure of shields, poles and other weapons. WHAT ROLE IS ANTIFA PLAYING IN THESE DEMONSTRATIONS? Trump and members of his administration have singled out antifa as being responsible for the violence at protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. In a pair of statements over the weekend, Attorney General William Barr described ""antifa-like tactics"" by out-of-state agitators and said antifa was instigating violence and engaging in ""domestic terrorism"" and would be dealt with accordingly. At a White House appearance Monday, Trump blamed antifa by name for the violence, along with violent mobs, arsonists and looters. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters earlier in the day that antifa is a ""big element of this protest,"" though she deferred to the Justice Department on the question of how one could be identified as a member. But it's unclear how big its involvement is. Bray said that although he believes people associated with antifa are participating in the demonstrations, it is difficult to establish how big of a role they're playing since there is no official roster of members and since the movement lacks the numbers to mobilize nationwide in such a dramatic, forceful way. ""The radical left is much bigger than antifa— much, much bigger — and the number of people who are participating in the property destruction are much, much bigger than the radical left,"" Bray said. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. WHAT DOES THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANT TO DO ABOUT ANTIFA? Trump tweeted Sunday, ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" It's not the first time he's endorsed that approach. Trump expressed a similar sentiment last summer, joining some Republican lawmakers in calling for antifa to be designated as a terror organization after the skirmishes in Portland. CAN THE ADMINISTRATION DO THAT? For one thing, antifa is not a discrete or centralized group, so it's unclear how the government could give it a designation. Beyond that, though, antifa is a domestic entity and, as such, not a candidate for inclusion on the State Department's list of foreign terror organizations. Those groups, which include Islamic extremist organizations and the Real Irish Republican Army, are based overseas rather than in the U.S. That designation matters for a variety of legal reasons, not least of which anyone in the United States who lends material support to an organization on that list is subject to terrorism-related charges. But ""there is not a domestic equivalent,"" said Joshua Geltzer, a former senior counterterrorism official in the Obama White House and founding executive director at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at the Georgetown University Law Center. There have been periodic calls, particularly after mass shootings by white supremacists, to establish a domestic terrorism law. But no singular domestic terrorism statute now exists. Asked Monday what legal authority the president would have for labeling antifa a terror organization, McEnany pointed to the existing statute under the U.S. criminal code that defines acts of domestic and international terrorism. But defining an act of terrorism is different than designating an entire U.S. group as a terror organization. ""US law does the 1st. It doesn't permit the 2nd,"" Geltzer tweeted after McEnany's remarks. Even if antifa is not a designated terror organization, FBI Director Chris Wray has made clear that it's on the radar of federal law enforcement. He has said that while the FBI does not investigate on the basis of ideology, agents have pursued investigations across the country against people motivated to commit crimes and acts of violence ""on kind of an antifa ideology."" ___ Associated Press writers Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Ore., and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report.

Advertisement Some police officers are showing solidarity with protesters in several US cities Share Shares Copy Link Copy Americans have been protesting the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police for days on end in dozens of cities throughout the United States.While tensions between police and demonstrators have heated up in many places, some officers have shown solidarity with the movement by hugging protesters, praying with them, mourning with them, and taking a knee to honor Floyd.In Atlanta, Georgia, a line of police officers holding shields during a protest Monday near Centennial Olympic park kneeled in front of demonstrators.In another image, an officer wearing a gas mask, helmet and vest was seen embracing a demonstrator in a hug on the fourth day of protests in the southern city.The Denver Chief of Police Paul Pazen joined in with demonstrators Monday, linking arms with attendees.On Sunday, Pazen said dozens of his officers had been injured while responding to the protests but were eager to return and protect the rights of demonstrators.In New York, Chief of Department of the New York City Police, Terence Monahan, embraced a demonstrator during a protest in his city Monday.On the West Coast, protestor Kevin Welbeck of Cre8 The Change shook hands with a California Highway Patrol officer during a protest in the Van Nuys area of Los Angeles.At least two officers in Connecticut joined demonstrators as they marched through Bristol Monday.Bristol Police Officer Nick Travisano was hugged by a protester as he joined a march with fellow officer Chris Bird.In Minnesota, the state where Floyd was killed, an officer and a demonstrator shared an emotional embrace during a protest in St. Paul.

1623090915,2020-06-02 06:03:53,Tensions rise as Trump threatens military force against protesters,https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/Tensions-rise-as-Trump-threatens-military-force-against-protesters-570947341.html,en,True,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"Undeterred by curfews, protesters streamed back into the nation’s streets Tuesday, hours after President Donald Trump pressed governors to put down the violence set off by George Floyd’s death and demanded that New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” Several thousand demonstrators gather in Oakland, Calif., on Monday, June 1, 2020, to protest the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (Source: AP Photo/Noah Berger) But most protests passed peacefully, and while there were scattered reports of looting in New York City, the country appeared calmer by late Tuesday than it did a day earlier, when violence swept through multiple cities. The president, meanwhile, amplified his hard-line calls from Monday, when he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn't do it. ""NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,"" he tweeted. ""The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!"" One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. ""Last night pushed me way over the edge,"" said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. ""Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless."" The crowd remained in place after the city's 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights' demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: ""Peaceful protest!"" On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John's Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in Los Angeles, Miami, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Houston, where the police chief talked to peaceful demonstrators, vowing reforms. ""God as my witness, change is coming,"" Art Acevedo said. ""And we're going to do it the right way."" In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday's protests. Macy's flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. ""We're going to have a tough few days,"" he warned, but added: ""We're going to beat it back."" He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and ""create peace."" Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city ""a disgrace."" ""The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,"" Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation's largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. ""I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,"" Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. ""I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good."" On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. ""It feels like it's just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing's really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,"" said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. ""There's always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we're seeing the breaking point around the country."" ""I live in this state. It's really painful to see what's going on, but it's also really important to understand that it's connected to a system of racial violence,"" she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump's threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. ""Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,"" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower's use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that tested the nation's ability to run elections while balancing a pandemic and sweeping social unrest. Joe Biden won hundreds more delegates and was on the cusp of formally securing the Democratic presidential nomination. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. ___ Sullivan reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report. Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

David McAtee was shot and killed by law enforcement as they broke up a crowd early Monday morning in Louisville, officials said.Steve Conrad, who was Louisville Metro Police Department's chief at the time, went to the scene shortly after it happened to give details. He said the incident happened around 12:15 a.m. in the parking lot of Dino's Food Mart, located at 26th and Broadway.McAtee owned a restaurant nearby called Yaya's BBQ.Mayor Greg Fischer called McAtee a wonderful citizen, and said many knew him as ""the BBQ man.""Conrad said LMPD and the National Guard were breaking up a large group at that location when someone fired at them. Law enforcement then returned fire, police said. Police said they have several persons of interest being interviewed and it is still unclear who fired the first shot and who struck McAtee.“It’s very clear that many people do not trust the police. That is an issue we’re going to work on and work through,"" Conrad said during an early morning news conference.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear held a news conference around noon saying to his understanding, there was significant footage of what happened, including from body cameras. He called on all of it to be released quickly.“I’m not asking people to trust our account (of what happened). I want to see the video for ourselves,” Beshear said.It was later learned that none of the LMPD officers present had their cameras activated. Two LMPD officers on the scene who police confirm were involved, Kate Crews and Allen Austin, have been put on administrative leave.The governor said he has heard the crowd at that food mart was not demonstrating at the time, but police responded because they were violating curfew.A curfew went into effect Sunday night at 9 p.m. for the whole city. That curfew has since been extended through June 8.It was an attempt by the mayor to settle unrest that has gone on for several days in the city over the Breonna Taylor case and other cases causing protests and riots across the country.Beshear also had Taylor's mother speak Monday, during which she said, ""We can't get justice with violence.""Seven people were shot the first day of protests in Louisville.

The 29-year-old officer in Las Vegas was shot as police tried to disperse a large crowd of protesters in front of a casino shuttered because of the coronavirus. At about the same time and less than three miles (4.8 kilometers) away, police outside a federal courthouse shot a protester who was wearing a black tactical vest and armed with two handguns and a rifle. Police said the man was shot as he reached for a firearm. In other violence around the country, four officers were shot and wounded in Missouri and others in New York were hurt when a car plowed into a line of police. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" said Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, who heads the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. The incidents came amid chaotic scenes that followed peaceful protests over the killing of Floyd, police brutality and racism. A number of cities have seen heavy-handed riot tactics by police and clashes between officers and demonstrators. On Monday night, as protests started to dwindle in St. Louis, four officers standing in a line were shot and injured when someone opened fire. All four were expected to recover. In the same city several hours later, police said four officers in a marked police car were fired on by men in a car. Police in Buffalo, New York, said an SUV broke through a police blockade at a protest and ran over a state trooper, breaking his leg and shattering his pelvis. Another trooper and a Buffalo police officer were also hit by the vehicle and treated for minor injuries. In Madison, Wisconsin, police Chief Vic Wahl said police officers were struck with rocks and projectiles. Over the weekend, police in Los Angeles reported rocks and other objects rained down on police at a demonstration near an outdoor mall, leaving one officer with a fractured skull. In Oakland, California, violence Friday night left 13 officers injured and a federal officer was fatally shot from an unidentified vehicle while providing security at a courthouse during a protest. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded, authorities said. Lombardo said officers in Las Vegas were being hit by rocks and bottles when a shot rang out and the officer, Shay Kellin Mikalonis, went down on the casino-lined Las Vegas Strip. Police said Mikalonis, a Las Vegas police officer for four years, was shot from across the street and 20-year-old Edgar Samaniego of Las Vegas was identified by video before he was later arrested on suspicion of the shooting. Jail and court records showed Samaniego was being held pending an initial court appearance on attempted murder and weapon charges. An attorney who represented Samaniego in a personal injury lawsuit in 2016 declined to comment, saying he was not immediately representing him on the criminal charges. Deputy Police Chief Chris Jones told reporters the man killed by police near the courthouse, 25-year-old Jorge Gomez of Las Vegas, had one of his three handguns mounted in what Jones called a ""carbine conversion kit"" that officials say made it resemble a rifle. Gomez remained near the courthouse after police ordered what the deputy chief called ""rowdy"" demonstrators to disperse, and was hit several times with beanbag projectiles before he was shot as he raised a gun toward officers who were helping an officer on the ground, Jones said. Lombardo and local officials pleaded multiple times in recent days for events to remain peaceful. They have so far resisted calls to impose a curfew in Las Vegas. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday he was praying for the ""officer who was senselessly shot"" and ""all of the communities across Nevada who are experiencing grief and pain."" ""It's during these trying times we must remind ourselves that creating a state where justice and peace exist together in partnership, not as a binary choice, is the goal we must all work toward,"" he said. Sisolak said he was activating ""additional"" members of the Nevada National Guard to support state and local law enforcement at the protests. He initially deployed the Guard over the weekend. The governor's office said the Guard units would not be making arrests or doing crowd control but would ""focus on protecting critical facilities, preserving public safety, and allowing individuals to exercise their rights to peacefully demonstrate."" Monday's protest began near President Donald Trump's non-casino hotel, Trump International Tower, just off the Las Vegas Strip and remained peaceful for more than four hours. ""All night long, everybody worked hard to keep everybody safe,"" said U.S. Marshal Gary Schofield, head of the local federal security agency involved with police in the shooting in front of the courthouse. ""Unfortunately, criminals hijacked the event."" ___ Associated Press writer Paul Davenport in Phoenix and photojournalist John Locher in Las Vegas contributed to this report.

Another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest. Several thousand demonstrators gather in Oakland, Calif., on Monday, June 1, 2020, to protest the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (Source: AP Photo/Noah Berger) They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of unrest, from heavy-handed police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. Dozens of others have been injured in the chaos, with police officers getting shot and protesters struck with rubber bullets. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: LOUISVILLE As police and the National Guard troops sought to clear a crowd Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. “We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.” Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said Tuesday that video from security cameras at McAtee’s business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gun as officers approached. “This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,” Schroeder said. The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd’s killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they tried to serve a search warrant. No drugs were found. ___ OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA A federal law enforcement officer was providing security at a federal courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers employed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service. They were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested, and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional seat north of Los Angeles. ___ INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as “Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after graduating. He also was a prominent businessman in the city, running multiple nightclubs. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together."" The circumstances of his shooting weren't immediately clear, but some media reports said it happened near his apartment. This death occurred the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. ___ DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. The circumstances of Kelly’s death are murky, and no arrests have been made. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because the protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kansas. “She was always smiling, always laughing. That’s why it’s so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,” Hale said. “That is not Italia. She was the bright, bubbly big personality in the room.” Separately, authorities said an officer patrolling Sunday was “ambushed” with gunfire. Another officer shot back, and the suspects fled. Their vehicle crashed, and they were arrested. Near where the officer was shot, police found a man dead from a gunshot next to a vehicle. Police say they found a handgun underneath his body. His identity has not been released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other and fled, police said. ___ MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest. ___ OMAHA, NEBRASKA James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man, was killed Saturday after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two downtown bars. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including Scurlock, approach white bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people shove Gardner to the ground, and he fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen jumping on Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges in the death, calling the shooting self-defense. But Gardner could still face misdemeanor gun charges because his concealed carry permit for the gun had expired, the police chief said. ___ DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone opened fire and then ran away. ___ SUBURBAN CHICAGO Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the suburb of Cicero, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania did not provide details about those who were killed but said it happened during protests. ___ Associated Press journalists Herbert McCann contributed from Chicago and Ryan J.

Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George floors last words, but they didn't die with him. You're still being heard going all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin put your life at risk. They speak to the nation were more than 100,000 people have lost their lives a virus and 40 million have filed for unemployment. With the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated black and brown communities, they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. It's a wake up call to our nation. In my view, it's for all of us, and I mean all of us. It's not the first time we've heard those words. They're the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it's time to listen to those words, to try to understand, to respond to him respond with action. A country is crying out for leadership leadership that can you. Nine US leadership That brings us together. Leadership that could recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on the neck for a long time. There's no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches. There's during businesses. Many have been built by the very people of color who are first time in their lives, are beginning to realize their dreams and bill wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for police sworn to protect and serve all people escalate tension, resort to excessive violence, way need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunistic, violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president, to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. Would peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president, a president from the doorstep of the People's House, the White House, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op? A photo of one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, D. C. We can be forgiven for believing the president's more interesting in power, then in principle were just serving the passions of his based on the needs of the people in his care, for that's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at ST John's Church. I just wish he opened it once in a while, said a brandishing. If he opened it, he could have learned something. They're all called love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump is interested in doing that work. Instead, he's preening and sweeping away all the guard rails. Lo have protected our democracy guard rails. I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one. So for an economic hardship, wondering, can I feed my family tomorrow? What's gonna have suffering under the weight of a generation after generation after generation, I've heard inflicted on people of color black brown in native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means. Degree. My losses are not the same as loss is felt by so many. But I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also knew, but the best way to bear loss and pain to turn it into that anger and anguish in the purpose. And Americans know what our purposes is a nation. It has to be guided. Mr. Guided guided us from the very beginning. No, it's been reported the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her daddy's arms, said, Oh, Daddy, she said, Now we're never going to get our freedom. Daddy was reassuring, Strong, brave. He said, No, don't worry, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Amid the violence and fear, Dr King persevered. He was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then 19 68. Hate cut him down in Memphis two days before Dr Key was murdered. Hey gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington. No, he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long said, it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have. We have to believe that still, that's our purpose. It's been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only creating, but they're treated equally, not just credited, would treated equally to become a nation to find, in Dr King's words, not only by the absence of tension before the presence of justice, I'm not just a not attention but justice. Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of F. D. R. And Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Jonah Salt. Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty and courage, and above all, we should be in America that chairs each other each and every one of us. You know, we're a nation in pain. We must let let our pain destroys. We're nation and raged. We can not our rage consume us. We're a nation. It's exhausted. But we will not allow our exhaustion to fetus as presidents. My commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome. We stand together. Finally, is one America. We'll rise stronger than we were before. We'll move that art closer to justice. We'll reach out to one another for speak out for one another. And please, please do what's recently been happening. Take care of one another. This is the United States of America. There's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it. We've done it together together, united. That's we are at our best. God bless you all. May God protect our troops que Mr Mayor. Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe.

Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of F. D. R. And Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Jonah Salt. Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty and courage, and above all, we should be in America that chairs each other each and every one of us. You know, we're a nation in pain. We must let let our pain destroys. We're nation and raged. We can not our rage consume us. We're a nation. It's exhausted. But we will not allow our exhaustion to fetus as presidents. My commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome. We stand together. Finally, is one America. We'll rise stronger than we were before. We'll move that art closer to justice. We'll reach out to one another for speak out for one another. And please, please do what's recently been happening. Take care of one another. This is the United States of America. There's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it. We've done it together together, united. That's we are at our best. God bless you all. May God protect our troops que",0.0

James Manni said. “These were not protesters. This was an intentional, coordinated attack on the city.""Police received intelligence several hours prior to the violence that people were coming from out of state armed with crow bars, flares and gasoline, Manni said.Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza on Tuesday morning said five of the people arrested were from out of state.Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven M. Paré said Tuesday that none of the hurt officers was seriously injured.The trouble started at around midnight when a crowd of 300 to 500 people gathered in the street outside the Providence Place mall, police said. At about 2 a.m. police deployed tear gas to disperse the crowd, but fireworks and sirens continued to be heard in the city for hours, according to media reports.At one point several people broke into the mall, and Manni thinks they intended to set it on fire.Manni and Elorza say the damage could have been much worse had the police not been prepared.“Last night’s incidents were devastating for our community who has already experienced so much unrest and pain,"" Elorza said in a statement. “Violence is never the answer and we need collective action - one that is productive, not destruction of our small businesses, who have been impacted so much already and by putting others safety at risk.""The mall, which reopened for the first time Monday since being closed in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic, was closed Tuesday, according to its website.",0.0

THERE’S NOTHING Advertisement Death toll grows in national protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Amid protests seeking justice for a black man killed after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck, several people have lost their lives. They include a well-known and popular owner of a barbecue spot in Louisville, Kentucky and a federal officer working security at a courthouse in Oakland. Many of these deaths have gone unnoticed, overshadowed by the turmoil roiling American cities.One man was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who made sure to provide free meals to officers. Another was a man known as ""Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest.They are among the people who have been killed as protests roiled American cities in the week since 46-year-old George Floyd died when a white officer jammed his knee into the back of the black man's neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of chaos engulfing cities across America, from heavy-handed riot police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism.Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black families to lose more members of their community amid the unrest.Dozens more have been hurt in various altercations — vehicles plowing into crowds, police officers suffering head injuries and broken bones and protesters ending up in emergency rooms with a variety of injuries from the melees.The death toll and circumstances surrounding the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know about the cases so far:LOUISVILLEAs local police and the National Guard sought to disperse a crowd early Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing the owner of a barbecue restaurant, David McAtee. The mayor has since terminated the city's police chief after finding out that officers on the scene did not activate their body cameras. The state police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating.The 53-year-old McAtee was an African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by.""We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. ""David was a friend to many, a well-known Barbecue man.""The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd's killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home.___OAKLANDA federal law enforcement officer was providing security at the federal courthouse in Oakland during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle.Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically injured in the shooting. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building's glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti.Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers and employed by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service; they were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional district north of Los Angeles. ___INDIANAPOLISTwo people were killed over the weekend amid unrest in Indianapolis, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University.Beaty was known as ""Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after his graduation. He also was a prominent businessman in the city and ran multiple nightclubs.""I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,"" coach Tom Allen said in a statement. ""Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.""The circumstances of his shooting weren't immediately clear but some media reports said it happened near an apartment where he lived. It also occurred the same night that an 18-year-old man also was fatally shot as protests broke out in the city.___MINNEAPOLISIn what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, a 43-year-old black man was fatally shot outside a pawn shop as rioting broke out last week in Minneapolis and then spread nationally.The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Calvin L. Horton Jr. Police say they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood.The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during unrest. ___OMAHA, NEBRASKAA 22-year-old black man was killed after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two bars in downtown Omaha. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including James Scurlock, approach bar owner Jake Gardner.Two people are seen on the video tackling Gardner, who ended up on his back and fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen tackling Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock.Authorities have declined to press charges, calling the shooting self-defense.___DETROITA 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver's seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot.___CHICAGO SUBURBTwo people were killed during unrest Monday in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, according to a town official.

You say you're against police brutality; will you do something humble and kneel with us?' and I said, 'Absolutely,' and I did and several of my officers joined me,"" Isaac said.Isaac spoke during a briefing Monday on the protests over the weekend, saying he and none of his staff believe what took place in Minneapolis was right and know law enforcement is more professional than that.""We have to move past this and those that have not made those necessary changes, they need to do that as well. I'm very proud of the work our men and women are doing,"" Isaac said. Protests in Cincinnati were largely peaceful Monday, scattered across the city's urban core and were relatively quiet, at least when compared to days prior.The protests are in honor of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, was killed after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota.A number of groups have been holding peaceful rallies to get the true message of their moment out, highlighting what they say are racial injustices and police brutality across the country. Organizers are asking participants to respect social distancing guidelines, wear masks and keep in groups no larger than 10 people.The protests have been followed by three nights of unrest in the city, with vandalism and looting during the first two nights.Isaac said he understands people are angry and he shares that anger and wants to talk about it.""It's never too late to talk. I understand that people are angry if we're not going to talk what's going to happen then, is this going to go on indefinitely.

Protesters gather in Sydney, Tuesday, June 2, 2020, to support the cause of U.S. protests over the death of George Floyd and urged their own governments to address racism and police violence. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a white police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. (AP Photo/Rick Rycroft) French protesters took a knee and raised their fists while firefighters struggled to extinguish multiple blazes as a largely peaceful, multiracial demonstration degenerated into scattered tensions. Police said at least 20,000 people joined the demonstration, defying a virus-related ban on protests to pay homage to Floyd and Adama Traore, a French black man who died in police custody. Electric scooters and construction barriers went up in flames, and smoke stained a sign reading ""Restaurant Open"" — on the first day French cafes were allowed to open after nearly three months of virus lockdown. Chanting ""I can't breathe,"" thousands marched peacefully through Australia's largest city, while thousands more demonstrated in the Dutch capital of The Hague and hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv. Expressions of anger erupted in multiple languages on social networks, with thousands of Swedes joining an online protest and others speaking out under the banner of #BlackOutTuesday. Diplomatic ire percolated too, with the European Union's top foreign policy official saying the bloc was ""shocked and appalled"" by Floyd's death. Floyd died last week after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The death set off protests that spread across America — and now, beyond. As demonstrations escalated worldwide, solidarity with U.S. protesters increasingly mixed with local worries. ""This happened in the United States, but it happens in France, it happens everywhere,"" Paris protester Xavier Dintimille said. While he said police violence seems worse in the U.S., he added, ""all blacks live this to a degree."" Fears of the coronavirus remain close to the surface and were the reason cited for banning Tuesday's protest at the main Paris courthouse, because gatherings of more than 10 people remain forbidden. But demonstrators showed up anyway. Some said police violence worsened during virus confinement in working class suburbs with large minority populations, deepening a feeling of injustice. As the Paris demonstration wound down, police fired volley after volley of tear gas and protesters threw debris. Police were less visible than usual at the city's frequent protests. Tensions also erupted at a related protest in the southern city of Marseille. The demonstrations were held in honor of Traore, who died shortly after his arrest in 2016, and in solidarity with Americans demonstrating against Floyd's death. The Traore case has become emblematic of the fight against police brutality in France. The circumstances of the death of the 24-year-old Frenchman of Malian origin are still under investigation after four years of conflicting medical reports about what happened. The lawyer for two of the three police officers involved in the arrest, Rodolphe Bosselut, said the Floyd and Traore cases ""have strictly nothing to do with each other."" Bosselut told The Associated Press that Traore's death wasn't linked with the conditions of his arrest but other factors, including a preexisting medical condition. Traore's family says he died from asphyxiation because of police tactics — and that his last words were ""I can't breathe."" ""I can't breathe"" were also the final words of David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia's treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police. The mostly Australian crowd at the authorized demonstration also included protesters from the U.S. and elsewhere. ""I'm here for my people, and for our fallen brothers and sisters around the world,"" said Sydney indigenous woman Amanda Hill, 46, who attended the rally with her daughter and two nieces. ""What's happening in America shines a light on the situation here."" Even as U.S. President Donald Trump fanned anger by threatening to send in troops on American protesters, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refrained from directly criticizing him and said the protests should force awareness of racism everywhere. ""We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,"" he said after pausing 21 seconds before answering. ""But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day. There is systemic discrimination in Canada."" More protests in various countries are planned later in the week, including a string of demonstrations in front of U.S. embassies on Saturday. The drama unfolding in the U.S. drew increasing diplomatic concern. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's remarks in Brussels were the strongest to come out of the 27-nation bloc, saying Floyd's death was a result of an abuse of power. Borrell told reporters that ""like the people of the United States, we are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd."" He underlined that Europeans ""support the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said peaceful protests in the U.S. following Floyd's death are ""understandable and more than legitimate."" ""I can only express my hope that the peaceful protests do not continue to lead to violence, but even more express the hope that these protests have an effect in the United States,"" Maas said. More African leaders are speaking up over the killing of Floyd. ""It cannot be right that, in the 21st century, the United States, this great bastion of democracy, continues to grapple with the problem of systemic racism,"" Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo said in a statement, adding that black people the world over are shocked and distraught. Kenyan opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga offered a prayer for the U.S., ""that there be justice and freedom for all human beings who call America their country."" Like some in Africa who have spoken out, Odinga also noted troubles at home, saying the judging of people by character instead of skin color ""is a dream we in Africa, too, owe our citizens."" ___ Associated Press writers Rick Rycroft in Sydney, Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, Lori Hinnant in Paris, Aritz Parra in Madrid, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Lorne Cook in Brussels, Peter Dejong in The Hague contributed. ___ Follow AP’s latest news about the protests at https://apnews.com/GeorgeFloyd Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

1623405643,2020-06-02 11:32:40,"Biden: Trump ‘consumed’ by ego, not leading during crisis",https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/Biden-Trump-consumed-by-ego-not-leading-during-crisis-570952611.html,en,True,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Joe Biden mounted one of his most aggressive attacks against President Donald Trump on Tuesday, deriding the commander in chief's disregard of core constitutional values and blistering him for being “more interested in power than in principle.” Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden speaks in Philadelphia, Tuesday, June 2, 2020. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) “He thinks division helps him,” the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said in a speech at Philadelphia’s City Hall. “This narcissism has become more important than the nation’s well-being.” Biden seized on police driving back peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday so Trump could briefly pose with a Bible in front of nearby St. John’s Church. “If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something,"" Biden said as he chided authorities for using “tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op."" Biden said Trump ""might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he’d find the First Amendment. It protects the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway denied that the president directed authorities' actions to move back the protesters and bristled at suggestions the church visit was merely a photo op. She countered that Biden and other critics had no basis to second-guess what was in the president's heart and his intentions. Still, Biden’s address marked a new phase of a presidential campaign that had been effectively frozen for more than two months by the spread of the coronavirus. The former vice president is now emerging from his Delaware home to confront Trump and using in-person appearances to offer direct competition with the president, rather than relying on virtual events that often failed to garner a lot of attention. It was the third consecutive day that Biden made a public appearance and the first time he's been out of the state since March. His remarks were carried live on the three major cable news networks. Biden spoke as upheaval in the wake of George Floyd’s death has spread around the country. While Biden spoke, the National Guard maintained a visible presence to defend public buildings as Philadelphia continues to face sustained violent protests. Several buildings adjacent to City Hall, including banks, convenience stores and hotels, were boarded up. He spoke of the “tug of war between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.” “The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character,"" he said. Since the early days of his candidacy, Biden has framed the election as a “battle for the soul of the nation.” He went into greater detail on Tuesday about what that meant and the questions voters should ask themselves. “I ask every American to look at where we are now and think anew: Is this who we are?” he said. “Is this who we want to be? Is this what we pass on to our kids’ and grandkids’ lives? Fear and finger-pointing rather than hope and the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety? Self-absorption and selfishness?” The tone was part of Biden's effort to cast himself as a “consoler in chief"" in stark contrast to Trump's blunt, confrontational style. While he noted that his anguish over the death of his son Beau five years ago from cancer isn't the same as the sadness felt by those protesting police brutality, he said he understood the hopelessness that can come with grief. “Like many of you, I know what it’s like to grieve,” Biden said. “I know what it feels like when you’re thinking you can’t go on.” He said “bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly” and offered examples of how he might ease racial tensions and govern. The former vice president called on Congress to act now on legislation that would place a federal ban on police using chokeholds. Biden also promised that, if elected, he would increase access to health care and improve the pay of first-responders and other workers who have stayed on jobs deemed essential during the pandemic. But Biden's speech was perhaps most notable for its ferocity, even though his criticism of Trump is common. He accused the president of being more worried about himself than the nation at a time when it “is crying out for leadership.” “This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,” Biden said, adding that Trump is “consumed with his blinding ego.” Biden offered a stark departure from Trump, who tweeted Tuesday that Washington “had no problems last night” and cited “many arrests,” as well as “overwhelming force” and “Domination,” for which he thanked himself. Trump has embraced the language of confrontation and war, seeking to be a “president of law and order,"" and betting that voters will want a more forceful approach at a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the president's reelection campaign, said Biden's speech “obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.” “President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity,” Pierson said in a statement. Despite his more confrontational approach, Biden was direct about the limits of his ability to singularly reconcile the nation's differences.

It's president. Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. The president urging states to dominate the situation, calling the nation's Governors Week in a Monday conference call and going a step further during his prepared remarks. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. That message received immediate pushback. I say Thank you, but no, thank you. I care more about them. Then some of the noise I heard on a morning focal. Meanwhile, after protesters were cleared, the president walking across the street to ST John's Episcopal Church, which was damaged in a fire Sunday, stopping to hold up a Bible, a move condemned by church officials. I just can't believe what my eyes see tonight, Advertisement What you need to know about your rights if you're planning to take part in protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Every American has the right to demonstrate peacefully. It's right there in the First Amendment. But it's not as simple as showing up with a sign.There are some measures officials can use to limit protests, and it's easy to accidentally tiptoe into legally murky territory if you don't know the specifics.So before you go, read up.Timothy Zick is a professor of government and citizenship at the College of William & Mary Law School. He specializes in constitutional law and the First Amendment, and he's written several books about both, including 2009's ""Speech Out of Doors: Preserving First Amendment Liberties in Public Spaces.""Emerson Sykes is a staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Technology and Privacy Project, who studies free speech protections under the First Amendment. Previously, he worked for Africa at the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law to protect free speech.1. What are my rights as a protester?The First Amendment gives Americans the right to assemble peacefully and air our grievances. Historically, we've relied on protests to hold power to account — think the March on Washington in 1963 for civil rights or the March for Our Lives demonstration in 2018 for gun control.The government can't stop you from peacefully protesting, but they can impose some restrictions on the time, place and manner of the protest — for example, barring protesters from walking onto a public highway or instituting a curfew that affects when protests end, Sykes said.They can't block a protest simply because of its content, though.If protests are planned in advance, organizers may obtain a permit so law enforcement can block off public spaces for them to demonstrate, Sykes said.There are protections, though, for ""spontaneous protests"" that spawn in response to current events, like the protests that spawned after George Floyd's death, he said.The First Amendment does not continue to protect protests that escalate to violence or the destruction of private or public property, he said.That's when law enforcement has the right to end them and deescalate threats of violence, he said.2. Where can and can't I protest?A slew of public spaces are OK for protests — sidewalks, city parks, streets and other public forums are usually lawful, Sykes said.Some states require you file a permit to block off streets, and the right to assembly doesn't give you the automatic right to march on a public highway, Zick said.People can be arrested or cited for blocking passage, he said.On private property, you don't have the right to assemble.Zick called it the ""no man's land"" in terms of the First Amendment, and police can move you off the property and keep you from demonstrating there.They may even have that right to move you even if you're on public property. Special rules apply to government buildings because protests may disrupt business going on inside, Sykes said.If the protest was permitted, you should be allowed to stay where you are — but leaving the permitted protest site may unintentionally lead you into prohibited places, he said.3. Can police or local leaders tell us to disperse?It depends, Sykes said: If a mayor pleads with people to go home, you have no legal obligation to comply.But police and local government can order you to leave, say, if they've imposed a curfew, as long as they give you ample notice to leave safely, Sykes said.If you stay on the street past a curfew — or if you protest on private property — you may be cited or arrested.4. What can I record?You have the right to take photos and videos of what's happening at a protest in a public place, and you can record police, too.Different states have different rules about audio recording and sharing that without the consent of the people whose voices you recorded, but the visual portion of videos and photos are always protected by the First Amendment, Sykes said.If you're interfering with legitimate police operations, they can ask you to move. It's best to videotape them from a safe distance.Police can't ask you to give them your phone or forcibly confiscate it without a search warrant, which they would've needed to obtain from a judge, he said.If they demand your phone, though, comply to avoid escalating the confrontation. Afterward, you can file a police misconduct complaint or contact the ACLU, he said.5. Someone took a picture of my face at a public protest. Is that allowed?At a public protest in the United States, you consent to a photo just by being there. Anyone who photographs you protesting in a public place may have a right to use your image, and you may see images of yourself in the media or online, Zick said.6. What should I pack to stay safe at a protest?Pack light, Sykes said. He suggests you bring water and a snack at minimum. If you bring a bag, prepare for it to be searched.In a pandemic, wearing a mask can keep you from breathing in droplets containing coronavirus. Coming within close contact of other protesters could expose you to their spit or sneezes, which may carry the coronavirus.Of course, keep an ID on your person, too.And if you fear you'll be arrested and will need legal help, memorize the number to a local or national law organization that could assist you in getting out of jail and handling your case afterward, Sykes said.7. What can — and can't — police do during a protest?It's the responsibility of police to protect your right to peaceful assembly.They're also empowered to uphold law and order, which gives them broad authority to deescalate threats of violence how they see fit.How they deescalate that violence depends on local laws and the circumstances under which they use them, which can be difficult to prove in court if you believe they used force unlawfully, Zick said.Like Sykes said, police do not have the right to search your phone or personal devices without a warrant, which only a judge can grant them.They also don't have permission to delete content from your phone, so if they tell you to delete a video you took or delete it themselves, they're in the wrong, he said.8. What can I do if a police officer stops me?Be polite. Don't resist.Ask them if you're free to go after speaking with them, Sykes said.If they say yes, calmly walk away and rejoin the protest if it's safe to.If they say no, and they detain you, don't resist and keep calm, Sykes said. Ask them what crime you're suspected of committing.9. What can I do if I get arrested?Some people get arrested intentionally as a form of civil disobedience. But whether or not you planned to get handcuffed, you shouldn't resist arrest, Sykes said.It's the best chance you have to stay safe.During your arrest, you can remain silent, as is your right, Sykes said.In some states, police are permitted to know your name if they ask, but they don't have the right to know where you're from or your citizenship status, he said.You can also ask for a lawyer — remember that number you held onto for legal support.If you're booked into jail, call a lawyer immediately, Sykes said.Police can't listen in on your call if you're phoning a lawyer, but they can listen in if you're calling a friend or family member, so be aware, he said.10. What can I do if I feel law enforcement or other officials violated my rights?You can sue for civil rights violations.You're allowed to do that under Section 1983 of federal law, which covers violations by state actors and police who violate First Amendment rights to assemble, speak and petition.Some protesters file large class-action suits that are occasionally successful, and sometimes authorities can pay damages when they decide litigation isn't worth it, Zick said.But qualified immunity can shield officers from civil liability if they didn't violate a clearly established law, he said.Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that protects police officers accused of interfering with constitutional rights from being liable unless they violated a clearly established and defined law.The lines are blurred at protests of what police are allowed to do and what constitutes overreaching, so ""clearly established"" constitutional rights are difficult to determine, Zick said.In this way, many police officers are protected by qualified immunity, Sykes said.""Those cases are difficult to win and expensive in terms of personal time and resources,"" Zick said. ""Naturally, I think a lot of the protesters whose rights may well have been violated may not pursue cases.""11. Can my workplace fire me if they find out I attended a protest?That depends on the contract you made with your employer when you were hired, but yes, it's possible, Sykes said.You have stronger constitutional protections for what you do outside of work, but depending on what you agreed on when you were hired, a company may be able to terminate your employment, he said.",0.0

The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you; you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" ""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard."" ""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly."" Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal."" ""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way."" In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

1623456270,2020-06-02 06:08:00,What We're Reading About The Past Week Of Protests,https://www.kios.org/post/what-were-reading-about-past-week-protests,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"If you've been trying to keep up with news about the nationwide protests against police brutality, the stream of stories can be overwhelming. In the days following George Floyd's homicide at the hands of Minneapolis police, reporters have been covering the protests in more than 140 cities across the country, trying to make sense of this tumultuous moment. Here are some of the most illuminating stories that we've read this week to help us understand how we got here, and the larger issues driving the protests. Minneapolis in context This is hardly the first time that Minneapolis has erupted into protests about police brutality and the killings of black people. In 2016, people took to the streets after police shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in a nearby suburb, Falcon Heights. And in 2015, Minneapolis police shot and killed Jamar Clark, which ignited two weeks of protests. In the Boston Review, Elizabeth Hinton relates the current protests in Minneapolis to the ones that followed the deaths of Clark and Castile. She also looks at the nationwide unrest that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Similar to the uprisings that took place over half a century ago, she writes, Minneapolis residents are fed up with the ""buildup of unanswered grievances and the lack of concrete changes to their immediate living conditions."" ""Rather than responding to violent political rebellion with policy—such as addressing mass unemployment, failing public schools, and inhumane housing conditions—policymakers and officials, from Richard Nixon's War on Crime to the bipartisan War on Drugs to Donald Trump's embrace of 'Law and Order' politics, have consistently sought to manage the material consequences of socioeconomic problems (e.g., urban decay and drug abuse) with more police, more surveillance, and, eventually, more incarceration. We as a nation still fail to reckon with the wisdom King prophetically offered toward the end of his life: that only 'social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention. There is no other answer. Constructive social change will bring certain tranquility; evasions will merely encourage turmoil.'"" Policing Over at Slate, Joel Anderson writes that while many police chiefs are condemning the excessive use of force by the police officer who killed Floyd, it's important to pay attention to what police are doing during protests: ""The initial response of police leaders may have felt like progress, but video footage of police and protesters clashing in the streets reveals the truth: Officers are much closer to what we see in viral videos documenting their brutality than in the well-intentioned words of their leaders. Despite the shift in public statements, police haven't changed since the protests of 2014 and 2015."" Many protesters, including journalists, have captured police on tape pointing guns, shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at them. Michael Dessam compiled a list at Slate of the ways police incited violence: ""Police all over the country tear-gassed protesters, drove vehicles through crowds, opened fire with nonlethal rounds on journalists or people on their own property, and in at least one instance, pushed over an elderly man who was walking away with a cane."" Existing while black The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging during the protests, and as we've reported, black people are dying from the virus at disproportionate rates. And as Annelisa Merelli at Quartz writes, police brutality is also a public health crisis that affects black people at a much higher rate than others: ""To give a sense of the magnitude of the crisis, the APHA reported that in 2016 alone (the latest year for which the organization could get reliable data, in itself a telling sign of the lack of priority accorded to the issue) at least 1,019 people were killed due to police intervention, and 76,440 were injured. This resulted in nearly 55,000 years of life lost, and had a large price tag, too: Police brutality costs $1.8 billion per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control's most recently available data (2010)."" Many argue that these two crises for the black community—police brutality and the coronavirus—aren't independent of each other. In fact, in both cases the extent of the death toll stems from systematic discrimination, and in both cases, the solution may require a deep rethinking of the overall system. In The Atlantic, Ibram X. Kendi examines a 1896 document by a statistician that says black people were naturally selected for disease and death, and would gradually become extinct. Kendi goes on to write that ""too many Americans have been waiting for black extinction since Hoffman,"" and that black Americans are ""living in a nightmare"" rather than the elusive American Dream: ""A nightmare is essentially a horror story of danger, but it is not wholly a horror story. Black people experience joy, love, peace, safety. But as in any horror story, those unforgettable moments of toil, terror, and trauma have made danger essential to the black experience in racist America. What one black American experiences, many black Americans experience. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the toil and terror and trauma of other black Americans. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the souls of the dead. Because they know: They could have been them; they are them. Because they know it is dangerous to be black in America, because racist Americans see blacks as dangerous."" Stories of solidarity Our NPR colleague Leila Fadel wrote about a Somali immigrant, Safia Munye, who opened a restaurant in Minneapolis more than two years ago—only to close her doors due to COVID-19. However, the community rallied behind her business and raised more than $180,000 to re-open this weekend—that is, until it was burned down during the protests. But despite her loss, Munye says she wants justice for George Floyd and change for Minneapolis. ""'My heart is broken. My mind is broken,' she says. 'I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice.'"" And The New York Times brought us another story about resilience and solidarity, about a Bangaldeshi family in Minneapolis who also lost their restaurant after it was burned down during one of the protests. Yet they support the uprising, and even opened the restaurant's doors as a medical haven for protesters. "" 'We were just trying to do what we could to help our community,' said [Hafsa] Islam, who helped treat wounded protesters. 'Sure, we had our business. Sure, we were trying to keep our kitchen open. But more than anything, we were concerned for our people.' ""The tension in [Ruhel] Islam's adopted city reminds him of his childhood in Bangladesh, when he lived through a dictatorship. Two of his fellow students were killed by the police, he said. 'We grew up in a traumatic police state, so I am familiar with this type of situation,' he said.""

Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful. But looting and vandalism in some areas along Van Nuys Boulevard prompted a response from officers, who fired bean bags. Authorities also responded to a fire at a strip mall, according to the Los Angeles Times. San Francisco Bay Area Some 15,000 people marched peacefully in downtown Oakland, according to a police spokesperson quoted in the East Bay Times. Most dispersed prior to the start of the city's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. More than 40 people were arrested for violating the curfew, according to the Oakland Police Department. The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said. Police said some protesters had vandalized a handful of vehicles, according to NPR member station KQED. More than a dozen San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions have imposed curfews in the wake of protests sparked by Floyd's death. Corrections: 6/02/20 A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that 15,000 people marched on Interstate 680 in Walnut Creek, Calif., and were dispersed by police.

Among those who decided to help on Sunday was a Beatrice business owner, who decided to lend a hand after hearing about the volunteer efforts through his church. Bryan Seibel, who owns Anytime Fitness in Beatrice, said despite the destruction he observed it was inspiring to see a strong showing of people who helped the cleanup efforts. “In spite of the high levels of tensions the previous night, it was very inspiring to see all the volunteers who came out,” Seibel said. “You look at what’s happening and the great divide in this country and think ‘how can we ever recover?’ When you see people come together the next morning, it’s inspiring. There were people walking around handing out bottles of water to volunteers, a hamburger stand, and it was a pretty neat show of community support.” Lincoln Mall sustained damage to buildings along the street that runs between the County-City Building and the state Capitol by vandals on Saturday night and Sunday morning.",0.0
1623456193,2020-06-02 12:37:00,'He Thinks Division Helps Him': Biden Condemns Trump's Protest Response,https://www.kios.org/post/he-thinks-division-helps-him-biden-condemns-trumps-protest-response,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"Updated at 11:46 a.m. ET Former Vice President Joe Biden condemned both police violence and President Trump's increasingly confrontational response to widespread unrest in a Tuesday morning speech delivered at Philadelphia City Hall. ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. ""More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that's what the presidency is: the duty to care — to care for all of us."" On Monday evening, Trump walked from the White House across Lafayette Square to hold a Bible in front of St. John's Church, after peaceful protesters were forcibly cleared from the park. (The U.S. Park Police say they used smoke canisters, not tear gas, though it's not clear if another law enforcement agency engaged there used other munitions.) The forceful dispersal began before the Washington, D.C., curfew had begun, and the bishop overseeing the church has harshly criticized Trump for appearing for photos without praying or addressing the racial issues at the heart of nationwide protests. Trump made the trip after making a speech in which he threatened to deploy the military to states and cities that do not quell violence. ""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it,"" Biden said. ""If he opened it, he could have learned something: that we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump isn't interested in doing that work."" Biden echoed the words spoken by George Floyd, the black man whose death while in custody of Minneapolis police has led to the widespread unrest. The words ""I can't breathe,"" Biden said, ""are a wake-up call for our nation."" Biden addressed police abuses and economic disparities that affect what he called ""communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time"" — alluding to the since-charged police officer who had his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. ""The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism,"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said. He asked Congress to take up measures he called ""a down payment on what is long overdue,"" including police reform bills outlawing chokeholds, banning the transfer of military weapons to police forces and establishing a uniform use of force standard. He said he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president. Biden also called for expanding the Affordable Care Act to millions more Americans, saying that Trump, who has long opposed the law, is ""consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to [former President] Barack Obama."" Obama's former vice president reiterated what he has long said on the 2020 campaign trail, that there is a ""battle for the soul of America."" ""Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears,"" Biden said. ""He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being that he leads. ""The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either,"" Biden said. ""But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate."" In a statement following his remarks, Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign adviser, said Biden has ""obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy."" She added: ""Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has used the politics of racial division when they suited his needs and he is doing it again."" On Monday, Biden held his first in-person campaign event since the coronavirus took hold in the United States in mid-March. He met with African American faith leaders in Wilmington, Del., listening to at-times critical feedback from the group. Many of the invited guests chided Biden for a political system that has delivered ""hopelessness"" to young African Americans. They told him the Obama administration had not done enough to economically lift black Americans, something Biden then promised would be a centerpiece of any recovery plan from the administration.

But when a black police officer responding to the crowds kneeled to show support and other officers joined, a crowd erupted into praise, prompting protesters to shake the hands of police and hug them. Protesters in Fort Worth have been noting deaths such as George Floyd, who died on Memorial Day in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes. The officer, who was since fired, now faces third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.Crowds there also have called attention to Atatiana Jefferson, whose family said she was playing video games with her nephew when a Fort Worth officer shot her in her home in October. The officer resigned and has been indicted on a murder charge.

(KETV) — Many spent Sunday morning cleaning up after windows and buildings were vandalized in both downtown Omaha and 72nd and Dodge. “Seeing all the destruction, I thought we need to try to come together this morning,” said Codie Strese, who helped clean up damage at downtown businesses. Several windows were smashed and vandalized after Friday and Saturday night’s protests. Over at 72nd and Dodge Streets, a group of University of Nebraska-Omaha students were also hard at work. “I was born and raised here, so I feel an obligation and responsibility to make sure that our community is kept right,” Kaia Phelps said. Phelps, a senior criminal justice and black studies major, organized the cleanup with her friends. “I believe there was a different narrative going around that Black Lives Matter started all of the throwing of bricks and pushing over police officers,” Phelps said. Phelps said the cleanup is also a protest, though. “We may not have signs, we may not be yelling, we may not have our fist in the air, but we are saying that, ‘We have a place here. We belong here,'” Phelps told KETV Newswatch 7. Like many other young people, Phelps and her friends say they’re fed up by tragedies like George Floyd’s death. “We don’t see much action and so, that’s why we’re out here, that’s why we see so many people protesting,” UNO Student Body President Jabin Moore said. Phelps and Moore say they want to see more black leaders speak up, both across the country and in Omaha. “We need more people to step into the forefront, and stop telling us what we can’t do and what we can do,” Phelps said. “Not just on Facebook Live, but really helping us to mobilize and showing us what we are supposed to do in these situations,” Moore said. The students say some people driving by gave them donations. They plan to put the money towards the James Scurlock fund. Scurlock, 22, was shot and killed during the protests in the Old Market.

The protest was one of many across the country after George Floyd, who was black, died while being taken into custody by a white Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin. Chauvin and three other officers have since been fired from the police force. Friday, Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Lincoln Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird spoke at a press conference Saturday morning and offered condolences to Floyd’s family and those impacted by violence against African Americans. “Not only do these tragedies harm the family and loved ones of those who are lost, they weaken the fabric of our entire society,” Gaylor Baird said. “We are all angry at the continued violence, racism, and unequal treatment inflicted on African Americans and people of color across our nation. We have seen it happen time and time again and we are outraged.” Gaylor Baird went on to say protests in Lincoln have largely been peaceful and calls for change must not be “perverted by violence.” LPD reported arresting three people who have been charged with failure to disperse.

(Photo by Jack Williams) Eight police officers were injured, including one who required staples to his head after he was hit by a projectile. One pedestrian was also injured in a hit and run auto accident near the scene. The Lincoln Police Department said they are investigating nine incidents of vandalism. The most extensive damage is reported to a business at 25th and O Street. They also reported damage to three police cruisers. LPD said they are working with organizers of a Black Lives Matter peaceful protest planned to take place at the Capitol Sunday and have been talking with them throughout the week. Meanwhile in Omaha, peaceful protests early in the evening turned to violence around 8:30. They centered on 72nd and Dodge, one of the busiest intersections in the city. Later in the evening, the intersection was shut down to traffic by police. Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert addressed members of the media during a press conference about Friday’s protests. “Last night for a while it was a peaceful demonstration and protests and then it did turn violent. And when people turn violent and they deliberately destruct property, that's when the police have to move forward and they have to act,” Stothert said.

(Photo by Jack Williams) Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer says police fired tear gas on protesters, as some protesters threw rocks and bottles at police. “From my viewpoint of the scene, I thought the Omaha police department and our cooperating agencies, handled the events that were presented to us in the most professional manner as we possibly could,” Schmaderer said. By 10:00 p.m., Schmaderer says protesters began targeting businesses for destruction. There were 12 businesses in the area vandalized, many with broken windows. At its largest, the crowd grew to 1,000 people. There were also police cruisers damaged by vandals. Schmaderer says of those arrested, 16 were white, three African-Americans and two were Hispanic. He expects another night of protests but asked people in Omaha to keep them peaceful. “Even if it's directed at us, we understand what's going on. We see that side of you have the anger and the tension across the country,” Schmaderer said. In the aftermath Friday evening, three people had minor injuries, one civilian and two officers. There were twenty-one arrests made for various charges including destruction of property, failure to disperse to carrying an illegal firearm.",0.0

Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder in the death; the other officers have not been charged. Dario Rossin, a 17-year-old Lincoln High student, said he was helping organize the protests because he and many others are tired of systemic racism and prejudice in this nation, which was highlighted by Floyd's death.

Omaha police are investigating the death of James Scurlock, a 22-year-old protester. The shooting occurred at about 11 p.m. Saturday in the city's Old Market area and within a couple of blocks of where protesters had gathered. Police said they arrested someone within the hour in connection with the shooting. Scurlock was shot outside an Old Market bar called The Hive, near 12th and Harney streets. Authorities would not release the shooter's name, but the World-Herald confirmed it was Jake Gardner, who owns The Hive. Hours before the Saturday night shooting, Gardner posted on Facebook about protecting his business. ""Just when you think 'what else could 2020 throw at me?'

Parker posted live on Facebook on Monday evening that Ricketts said in a meeting with him and other black pastors and leaders: ""The problem I have with you people ...""

By the time the workers paused Tuesday morning, little was left of a spire that had become a lightning rod for controversy in recent years and a focal point for local protesters outraged by George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis. On Sunday, the obelisk — known formally as the Confederate Sailors and Soldiers Monument — was the site of a speech from Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, who pleaded with the crowd. Some protesters had already vandalized the monument and toppled another statue in the park, that one of former Confederate officer Charles Linn. Woodfin asked that demonstrators refrain from trying to tear down the much larger monument — so that his government could do it instead. ""Allow me to finish the job for you,"" the mayor told a crowd behind his mask and a megaphone. And he persuaded them to give him until midday Tuesday to pull the monument down. ""I wanted you to hear it directly from me. But I need you to stand down."" On Monday, Woodfin declared a state of emergency and implemented a curfew for the city, citing the previous night's protests during which police arrested at least two dozen people. Birmingham isn't the only city reckoning with its Confederate past in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Since the release of a video showing the black man's arrest in Minneapolis, during which a white officer plants a knee on Floyd's neck, protesters in several cities and towns below the Mason-Dixon Line have directed their frustration — and sometimes vandalism — toward local Confederate monuments. In Alexandria, Va., a statue commemorating Confederate soldiers came down Tuesday morning. It was removed a month earlier than scheduled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy due to fears of vandalism, according to The Washington Post. Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving. pic.twitter.com/CZTjlOkpfT — Justin Wilson (@justindotnet) June 2, 2020 This week's move likely isn't the final chapter in the Birmingham monument's story, which was knotty well before the latest spasm of unrest trained attention back on it. Woodfin's predecessor, William Bell, ordered the memorial partly hidden with plywood screens in 2017 following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued the city, citing a violation of a state law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, which protects against the relocation or alteration of Confederate symbols that have been up for more than four decades. A unanimous state Supreme Court decision last fall sided with the monument's supporters, bringing the plywood down and assessing a fine of $25,000 against the city of Birmingham. Now Marshall has threatened another lawsuit over the city's move. ""Should the City of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today,"" the attorney general said in a statement issued Monday, ""city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the [Alabama Memorial Preservation] Act to pursue a new civil complaint against the City.""

Many of the protests broke out in places where the virus is still circulating widely in the population. In fact, an Associated Press review found that demonstrations have taken place in every one of the 25 U.S. communities with the highest concentrations of new cases. Some have seen major protests over multiple days, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The protests have come just as communities across the nation loosen restrictions on businesses and public life that have helped slow the spread of the virus, deepening concern that the two factors taken together could create a national resurgence in cases. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser warned Sunday after days of protests rocked the nation’s capital. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo bemoaned the crowds, saying that hundreds could potentially have been infected, undoing months of social distancing. A fresh outbreak in the places where protesters gathered could lead to reinstituting shutdowns. The AP’s review focused on large metro counties — the central counties within metro areas with more than 1 million people — that showed the highest rates of new cases per capita over the past 14 days. While case numbers and deaths have been trending down in several of the cities where the largest protests have occurred, the number of people in those places infected with the virus — and with the ability to spread it — remains high. And in some of the communities, such as Minneapolis, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has been rising. Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes, even as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Minneapolis has been ground zero for the sprawling protests, which have crossed the Mississippi River into neighboring St. Paul. The unrest has coincided with “the very worst days of the pandemic so far” in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “Our ICU bed care is at its all-time high and is really on the edge,” he said. Ramsey and Hennepin counties, home to the Twin Cities, ranked seventh and eighth for the highest per capita new cases in the AP analysis. Each has seen more than 250 cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks, together reporting nearly 2,000 new cases in the last week alone. Experts point out that other factors associated with protests could accelerate the spread of the virus. For instance, tear gas can cause people to cough and sneeze, as can the smoke from fires set by people bent on destruction. And both also prompt protesters to remove their masks. Crowding protesters who have been arrested into jail cells can also increase the risk of contagion. An AP tally found that, thus far, more than 5,600 people have been taken into custody. Protesters and police shouting at one another nose-to-nose also is raising alarms. Osterholm and other public health experts note, however, that the protests aren’t necessarily as alarming as other events that could fuel new cases because they take place outside and many people are wearing masks. In some cases, hand sanitizer also is being informally distributed. And Dr. David Eisenman, director of the Center for Public Health and Disasters at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said he feared partisan forces might accuse cities of bringing fresh cases on themselves. “I’m actually more worried about how, if those spikes occur, how that information will be weaponized against the notion of protests,” he said. Eisenman called protesting an “essential activity,” possible to practice with reduced risk. He said his grown children protested in Los Angeles and are taking safety precautions now, including isolating themselves at home. They plan to get tested for COVID-19 in about a week. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the hospitalizations for coronavirus in the Washington metro area have been on the decline but that she knows that could change. “There are a lot of unknowns about what happens next,” she said. Wen was the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore during the 2015 uprising after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and said many health clinics were closed and pharmacies burned down, making it difficult for members of disadvantaged communities to access health care. It’s a concern for her now, too. “You will have compounded health issues that go beyond COVID-19,” she said. Public health experts said it will take two to three weeks to know whether the protests cause a surge in coronavirus cases. And even then, they can’t definitively tie it to the demonstrations. The unrest is happening in tandem with the reopening of gyms, hair salons, restaurants, parks and beaches. It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. In Los Angeles, barbershops and in-person dining were allowed to resume last weekend, just as protests descended into destruction and more than 1,000 people were arrested. Nearly 10,000 new cases have been reported in Los Angeles County in the past week. Hundreds of people also were arrested in Chicago, where Cook County has had among the highest per capita rates of new cases of any large county in the nation, with 283 new cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks. “The absolute number of cases is still high. We feel good about the fact that we’ve established a decreasing incidence, but we have a ways to go,” said Dr. Ronald Hershow the director of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Hershow and others noted that the racial disparities laid bare by coronavirus — with communities of color bearing a disproportionate burden of infections and deaths — overlap with the issues being protested on streets across America and around the globe. “Racism kills,” Hershow said. “Sometimes that’s direct, as in the case of George Floyd. And sometimes it’s through a virus like COVID-19.” ___ Forster reported from Berkley, Massachusetts. Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",0.0

This still image was pulled from a video which showed protesters sprayed with liquid from a toy water gun used by a passenger in a car driving by. Video of the incident obtained by Local4 shows a teenager spraying protesters while riding in a car driving by the street. Protesters who were hit say it smelled like vinegar, but in the video that was posted to the boy's Snapchat he repeatedly said it was mixed with urine. The incident happened Sunday night during a Black Lives Matter protest march from a Grand Island park to a parking lot on South Locust Street. ""It was just really disrespectful and that kid thought it was a joke and it was a prank and it's not,"" Jasmine Tapia, a protester who was hit with the liquid, said. ""What we are fighting for is not a prank and not something to be messed with."" Police told Local4 that they have identified at least two people who were in the car driving by the protesters. They are treating it as a criminal matter and expect charges to be filed by Wednesday. They say they are unsure what the liquid was but if it was just vinegar, the charges would likely be misdemeanors. If however, it was determined that bodily fluids were involved, the offense would be a felony. Protesters say they won't let incidents like this stop them from continuing their fight against police brutality. The group was back on the street both Monday and Tuesday night as well. ",0.0

Republicans are particularly interested in the decision-making inside the Obama-Biden administration.

""We're in the middle of the worst public health and economic crisis in a century,"" he said, ""and what is Senator Johnson focused on? Running a political errand for Donald Trump by wasting Homeland Security Committee time and resources attempting to resurrect a craven, previously-debunked smear against Vice President Biden."" It is the allegation at the heart of Trump's impeachment — the president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and conspiracy theories about the Biden family.

The Senate acquitted the president in February after a contentious trial. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans using the Senate to try to help get Trump reelected.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Senate Republicans are launching investigations involving the Obama administration and President Obama's vice president, the presumptive Democratic nominee this time, Joe Biden. Today the Senate Judiciary Committee is beginning hearings on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. Republicans are also investigating what they claim is questionable dealings by the Biden family, although there's no evidence to support those CLAIMS. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis has this preview. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Senate Republicans haven't always shared President Trump's interest in investigating Joe Biden. Those days are over. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK SCOTT: The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the United States, who is currently trying to be president, got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $30,000 - or $80,000 a month. DAVIS: Florida Senator Rick Scott joined every Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month to vote for a subpoena of Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. A spokesman for the Biden campaign has accused Republicans of, quote, ""running a political errand"" for the president. This allegation is at the heart of Trump's impeachment. The president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and unfounded theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and Trump was impeached for abuse of power for making the ask.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler announced Tuesday that the panel will hear testimony from whistleblowers and former department officials who are prepared to describe ""specific incidents of misconduct"" and the politicization of the department under Barr and President Donald Trump. Nadler did not say who the whistleblowers are, and the hearing has not yet been scheduled. Nadler said the committee will also introduce a bill to slash the budget of Barr's personal office by $50 million, legislation that is unlikely to pass in the GOP-led Senate. Barr has failed to appear before the committee for the year and a half he has been in office. He was scheduled to testify in March, but that hearing was canceled when Congress left town due to the coronavirus pandemic. Nadler said the panel has been unable to reschedule the appearance since. ""Mr. Barr has thoroughly corrupted the integrity of the criminal justice system, he has shown contempt for Congress, and the committee has an obligation to hold him to account,"" Nadler said. The Justice Department sent Nadler a letter this week citing White House guidance that cabinet-level officials are not permitted to participate in congressional hearings during the month of June without approval from White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, according to a person at the Justice Department familiar with the message. The person was not permitted to publicly release the letter and requested anonymity. The letter said Barr would be happy to consider testimony when that guidance expires, or at the ""return of regular order to the House of Representatives."" Republicans have criticized House Democratic leaders for suspending most in-person activities during the coronavirus epidemic. Tensions have been high between Barr and the House panel ever since the attorney general declined to show up at a 2019 hearing on special counsel Robert Mueller's report. Since then, committee Democrats have repeatedly said that Barr was politicizing the department as a way to protect Trump, including by overruling prosecutors to lower the amount of prison time it would seek for Trump confidant Roger Stone and by requesting the dismissal of its own criminal case against former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn. Nadler said the panel would file an amicus brief in the Flynn case. Nadler also criticized Barr for his role on Monday as officers under federal command used smoke canisters and pepper balls to force back peaceful demonstrators outside the White House so Trump could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Barr was part of Trump's entourage and was in Lafayette Park watching the demonstrations just before officers pushed back the crowd. Barr told Congress he couldn't find the time to testify because of the coronavirus pandemic, Nadler said, ""but took the time to tour the peaceful protests at Lafayette Park"" before the chaos unfolded. Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear the park, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. ___ Associated Press writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this story. Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

1623661334,2020-06-02 17:28:22,Barr vows ‘even greater’ law enforcement resources in unrest,https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/Barr-vows-even-greater-law-enforcement-resources-in-unrest-570961171.html,en,True,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"Officials in the nation’s capital pushed back Tuesday on an aggressive response by the federal government to demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, with the mayor flatly rejecting a Trump administration proposal for the federal government to take over its police force and one county in Virginia pulling its officers from Washington. The federal government has deployed law enforcement officials from numerous agencies, and National Guard troops from a number of states have been sent to the District of Columbia. Attorney General William Barr, who is directing the federal law enforcement response in the city, promised by Tuesday ""even greater law enforcement resources and support in the region."" District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser said the Trump administration floated the idea of taking over the Metropolitan Police Department, a proposal she strongly rejected. She threatened to take legal action if the federal government attempted to do so. But there were signs that the federal response would be even more aggressive Tuesday night, as Washington prepared for a fifth night of protests. Hours before a 7 p.m. curfew for the second night in a row, cars were being stopped at military checkpoints in downtown Washington and a cavalry of armored military vehicles could be seen driving through the district. Businesses were boarding up windows with plywood in anticipation of another night of violence after fires were set, windows were shattered, store shelves were emptied and dozens of police officers were injured in days of protests. Two Defense Department officials said the Trump administration had ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a ""show of force"" against demonstrators protesting the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis policeman pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Police made over 300 arrests, mainly for violating the district's curfew. Earlier Monday evening, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback moved aggressively to clear protesters away from Lafayette Park near the White House in advance of President Donald Trump's walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. After participating in the show of force, Arlington County in Virginia pulled out its officers, saying they were used ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" County Board Chair Libby Garvey said on Twitter she's ""appalled"" that the mutual aid agreement was abused ""for a photo op."" In a phone interview, Garvey said the aid request came from U.S. Park Police, and that the agencies have aided each other routinely over the years. She said Arlington Police had helped in Washington on Saturday and Sunday without incident. Arlington County officials said in a statement their officers never wielded their batons and did not fire rubber bullets or tear gas. But after watching the scene unfold on live television, the police chief ordered all the officers to return to Virginia. ""This unprecedented decision by the County was a necessary response to an unprecedented situation,"" the statement said. Officials said they were reevaluating the mutual aid agreements to ensure officers ""are never again put in a situation where they are asked to take action that is inconsistent with our values."" The U.S. Park Police on Tuesday defended its actions at the park, saying it issued three warnings over a loudspeaker before clearing the area of protesters, some of whom they said were becoming violent, throwing projectiles and trying to grab weapons. It said it used smoke canisters and pepper balls to disperse the crowd. Barr ordered law enforcement officials to clear the park and push back the perimeter around the White House when he arrived there Monday evening, ahead of the president's remarks, leading to police using force to disperse protesters, a person familiar with the matter told the AP. Officials had met Monday morning and decided the perimeter had to be moved by at least one full block, which was expected to happen by Monday afternoon, after multiple fires were set in the park the night before, the person said. When Barr arrived, he was surprised it hadn't been done and directed action to be taken, according to the person, who could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Monday, in a call with governors, Trump and Barr had encouraged more aggressive action against those who cause violence during protests across the country. The call raised questions about whether using more aggressive law enforcement measures against demonstrators protesting police brutality would only increase tensions. Trump said he was ""taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America."" The president urged governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited with helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis, and demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. ""Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,"" Trump said. Between the protests and the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the National Guard has been deployed at its highest level in recent history, surpassing the number of troops sent to the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 66,700 soldiers and airman have been activated — 45,000 to assist with the pandemic and more than 17,000 to help with the protests. The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, a White House official said. The official added that Trump's message to governors was if they don't utilize all of the tools in their arsenal they shouldn't expect a sympathetic response from Washington if they request federal dollars to help with clean-up and recovery down the line. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Other law enforcement resources are also being mobilized in Washington. The Justice Department had deployed agents from every one of its agencies, including the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, an elite tactical unit, and riot teams from the Bureau of Prisons. The U.S. Park Police and Secret Service have had dozens of officers out in riot gear in Washington for the last few nights, in addition to the Metropolitan Police Department. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other Homeland Security agencies were also dispatched. Most of the protesters have been peaceful and tried to discourage violence. Trump, Barr and others have tried to blame some of the civil unrest on left-wing extremist groups, including antifa, and other ""anarchists."" Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. The Justice Department has vowed to treat the ""violence instigated and carried out by antifa & other similar groups"" as domestic terrorism. Although there isn't a specific federal domestic terrorism statute, prosecutors could charge other offenses and seek enhanced sentencing. The U.S. military and National Guard are operating in Washington under the official mission name Operation Themis, according to two Pentagon officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so publicly. In Greek mythology, Themis was a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice. Army Lt. Col. Chris Mitchell, a Pentagon spokesperson, said they were not aware of the operational name but said it's possible. The Associated Press reviewed a Defense Department document that showed the DC response is under the banner of Operation Themis. The document was marked unclassified. ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Lolita C.

The sanctions for racism — if they are handed out at all — can often be derisory.

(Source: AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) Pelosi invoked Biblical scripture to reject Trump's clampdown on peaceful protesters outside the White House and she drew on past presidents — including George H.W. Bush in the aftermath of the Rodney King unrest and Barack Obama following the death of Eric Garner — as models of the nation's chief executive at a time of crisis. ""We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many presidents before him to be a healer in chief and not a fanner of the flame,"" Pelosi said. As pleas for reconciliation over the country's long struggle with racial inequality were met with demands for accountability over George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis, there was a shifting tone coming from Congress. Gone are the days when ""Black Lives Matter"" protests were met simply with ""Blue Lives Matter"" retorts in support of law enforcement. Instead, Congress seems to have heard the protesters outside its doors. ""You can understand the outrage,"" McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, said. McConnell said it's not only the death of Floyd at the hands of white police in Minnesota drawing protesters into the streets, but of other African Americans, including Breonna Taylor in his home-state of Kentucky. ""There is no question that there is residual racism in America,"" McConnell told reporters. ""It's been a longtime dilemma and we all wish we could get to a better place."" As the world watches a nation in turmoil, Democrats and some Republicans are swiftly preparing inquiries into the president's actions against the protesters and a legislative response to the police violence and racial inequality at the heart of marches erupting in communities nationwide. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., joined the protests. Trump was widely criticized for clearing protesters late Monday from outside the White House so he could walk across the street to hold up a Bible outside historic St. John's Church. It was viewed as a photo opportunity and criticized by the congregation's bishop. McConnell declined to directly comment on Trump's handling of the crisis. However, several Republicans on Tuesday suggested it would be better if Trump helped calm the nation rather than escalate the already tense conditions in Washington and across the country. ""I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,"" said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Nebraska, in a statement. ""Every public servant in America should be lowering the temperature."" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called on Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to refuse the use of military helicopters and tear gas for ""ugly stunts"" like the one Monday. Senate Democrats proposed, and Republicans rejected, a resolution condemning the president's actions. McConnell offered instead a resolution condemning rioting and police violence against black Americans, which Schumer rebuffed as insufficient. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said he was ""glad the president led"" by clearing the protesters from the park. Cruz and other Republicans blamed outside agitators from the ""antifa"" anti-fascist movement for intervening in otherwise peaceful protests that resulted in looting and other property damage. Still, for a growing number of lawmakers there is an undeniable pattern of inequality in the treatment of black Americans by law enforcement, and they want to address it. Several Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, called Floyd's death a ""murder."" One, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said he understood there's a difference between his experience telling his sons to call the police if they need help and black families warning children to be cautious around law enforcement so as not to risk being harmed. ""That's a different kind of America and I think people are understanding those protests make sense,"" Blunt said. More than 40 bills — from banning police choke holds and racial profiling to preventing the federal transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement to a long-sought federal anti-lynching law — are now under consideration on Capitol Hill. One House Democrat probed the Secret Service for any communication about Trump's ordering the clampdown on protesters outside the White House. Using words like ""dictator,"" ""fascist"" and other terms to describe Trump's actions, Democrats pleaded with Americans to stand with those working to improve police treatment of minority populations. ""Racism is bad for everyone,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. She and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., among the nation's few black senators post-Reconstruction, spoke of their own childhoods growing up in civil rights era, a legacy of the nation's long path toward a more inclusive and representative government. With the Capitol still partly closed due to the coronavirus, a pandemic that is disproportionately striking black Americans, Congress is now confronting another deepening crisis. The Congressional Black Caucus announced a virtual town hall Friday with civil rights leaders, and House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler is planning a hearing next week on policing. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said House lawmakers could be recalled to Washington this month to vote on legislation to address police and other reforms. Schumer urged McConnell to consider law enforcement reforms legislation by July 4. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report. Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

We get some good advice.  Guests Melissa Giraud, social justice educator, researcher and advocate. Co-founder of EmbraceRace, an organization that provides resources for parents to teach their children about race. (@RaceEmbrace) Andrew Grant-Thomas, social justice researcher and advocate. Co-founder of EmbraceRace. Former director of programs at the Proteus Fund, a national foundation committed to advancing justice through democracy, human rights, and peace. Deputy director at the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University. (@RaceEmbrace) Christian Cooper, avid bird watcher, comic book writer and biomedical editor for Health Science Communications. New York Audubon Society board member.  Interview Highlights Last week, a video of a white woman calling the police on Christian Cooper, a black birdwatcher in Central Park, went viral. Christian Cooper had asked the white woman, Amy Cooper, to leash her dog. Christian Cooper on how he felt during the confrontation and whether he was scared Christian Cooper: “Any sort of confrontation, of conflict, can be scary. So, yeah, I was scared. I wasn’t overwhelmed by being scared. But, yeah, I was certainly scared. But I think one thing I always try to keep in my head, whenever I’m engaged in any sort of conflict, because there’s always conflict in our society. You don’t want to seek it out, but at the same time, I’m not afraid of it either. You know, there are times when you’re going to have to be in conflict with somebody for various reasons. But the thing I always try to keep in my head is, ‘The person who remains calm wins.’ And that’s what I tried to do in that situation. I just tried to remain calm and just keep doing what I was doing.”  On talking with kids about race For white parents, expose kids to diversity Melissa Giraud: “You start young for one, and you start by exposing your child both, hopefully, in your neighborhood, in your community. … You know, if you’re in a segregated neighborhood, which many of us are, by going out to other communities. To expose them, whether it’s after school or at school, to people who are different from them racially and otherwise. And to make sure that your kids understand that you value difference. And you learn from it. And it’s important to you that they have diverse friends. So maybe you also can model that if it’s possible, again, in your neighborhood, in your part of the country.” On starting the conversation early Melissa Giraud: “It’s multi-factorial. So people often want a recipe and there isn’t a recipe. Like if we knew how to solve structural racism, systemic racism, we would have done it, you know? But we do know that the reason it’s so hard to solve is it’s systemic. And so there are a lot of things to do. So your kid is learning, you know, this cultural soup. They’re learning this stuff from very early. And if we could raise kids in a way that would preempt some of these biases by exposing them to a lot, so they’re not afraid. Also teaching them about injustice. And about their own privilege.”  On Point spoke to Ishmail Abdus-Saboor yesterday about how his family is processing the news of this week. As a black parent of two kids, he knew it was time to talk to them about what was happening blocks away from their home in Philadelphia. Here’s part of that conversation: Ishmail Abdus-Saboor: “I look scared as I was telling him these things. And I could equally see the fear on his face as I was sharing with him. And then, you know, out of nowhere, he asks me, ‘Does that mean we’re going back to being slaves?’ I mean, it wasn’t like slavery was on his mind. It’s not like we just had a conversation about slavery. So the fact that his mind went there and he made that connection, it was startling, jarring and it pierced a sword through my heart.” On how black parents can talk to their kids about race Melissa Giraud: “If your child is in a targeted group, this is something we think about a lot. … And it would depend on the conversations that you’ve had before as well. It’s more likely that black families in particular have spoken about racism and have also done sort of the countercultural work of cultural empowerment, of talking about freedom fighters like Christian. Of people who have resisted, have taken risks, really. Because they don’t know what the outcome will be, but have been able to stand up and to go on birding. You know, Chris has continued with this thing that he loves to do. … I would also say that showing the Floyd video, like we haven’t shown those to our kids. … You really want to not traumatize or re-traumatize kids who are already aware that they’re in some targeted group.” Andrew Grant-Thomas: “It’s important, I think, for kids to know that there are a lot of people who have done the work to get us, you know, to effect the kind of progress that we’ve made. Clearly, there’s a tremendous more amount of work to do. And we have allies in this work and we ourselves can do that work. Whether it’s about educating ourselves, about giving money to the organizations that are doing the work, it’s about giving our time. It’s about how we raise our children. Advocating, you know, being influencers in our own circles, there are a lot of things that we can do.” On the importance of asking questions Melissa Giraud: “Ask questions. … You can start with what they know, or what they think, or what’s their response to the video that Chris made of Amy Cooper. And talk it through.” Andrew Grant-Thomas: “I think we often don’t know, we’re not even aware that children are thinking about these things, making sense. That their sensibilities around race are emerging even very, very young, because we don’t create the space for them to show us. So this point about asking questions to me is largely about giving them the space to tell you, to share with you what they’re thinking again, what sense they’re making, what meaning they’re making. And for you to have an opportunity to share sort of your experiences, your ideas, your questions, and to provide some context, which, you know, as a four-year-old or a five-year-old, they probably don’t have.” On teaching white kids to be allies Christian Cooper: “I think the best thing you could do is teach young white kids to be good allies. To stand up for other people in difficult situations, and that might get us to a better place.”  From The Reading List New York Times: “Chris Cooper Is My Brother. Here’s Why I Posted His Video.” — “I grew up in a family of activists and my parents were teachers. They raised me and my brother, Chris, to never shy from fighting injustice. From police brutality, to the war in Iraq, to climate change, we’ve lifted our voices in protest.” EmbraceRace: “‘How do I make sure I’m not raising the next Amy Cooper?’” — “In our social media age, the figure of the ‘entitled White woman’ who calls the police on people of color, especially Black people, simply for living their lives has become so common that she has become a meme.” The Atlantic: “Becoming a Parent in the Age of Black Lives Matter” — “In a park about half a mile from my home is a wide-open field of grass, whose thin, uneven blades rise up past my ankles. The playground near the park is, like other playgrounds across the country, no longer open, surrounded by the orange-plastic fencing that has become unsettlingly familiar.” Houston Chronicle: “How to talk with your kids about police, race, protests” — “This week, the world witnessed video of former Houston resident George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, pleading for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck in Minneapolis. Floyd’s subsequent death sparked protests nationwide. Watching the tragic events unfold on TV or social media can take an emotional toll on most adults, but what about children?” Chalkbeat Colorado: “‘Moments like now are why we teach’: Educators tackle tough conversations about race and violence — this time virtually” — “Reading about Brown v. Board of Education over Google Meet. Holding one-on-one Zooms with students struggling with their emotions. Planning lessons on criminal justice reform for the fall — both in-person and remote, in case school buildings don’t reopen.” USA Today: “George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. What do we tell our children?” — “Should we tell the children? How? Those are among the many questions parents are asking after the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many white parents wonder whether to talk with their kids at all, while parents of color swallow their grief and fear to have ‘the talk’ once again.” CNN: “How to talk to your children about protests and racism” — “As cities and social media explode with anger over the killing of yet another black man at the hands of police, worried parents struggle with how to protect their children from seeing the worst of the violence while simultaneously explaining the ravages of racism.” This article was originally published on WBUR.org.

1623723262,2020-06-02 16:25:00,Pelosi Asks Black Caucus To Come Up With Police Reforms Following Protests,https://www.kios.org/post/pelosi-asks-black-caucus-come-police-reforms-following-protests,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has asked the Congressional Black Caucus to lead the process of drafting a legislative response to the protests that have swept the country following the death of George Floyd. House Democrats are sorting through dozens of proposals to address policing issues, including excessive use of force and racial profiling. ""It is time, it is time for us to address the concerns that were being expressed by the protesters,"" Pelosi said at a press event at the Capitol Tuesday. ""This is not a single incident. We know this is a pattern of behavior. and we also know the history that brings us to this sad place."" Democrats hope to calm the increasingly incendiary atmosphere in the country over Floyd's death by finding ways to address the underlying systemic problems enraging protesters in the streets. There is some degree of bipartisan support for reviewing the tactics that led to Floyd's death. Many Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have acknowledged what McConnell called ""egregious wrongs."" McConnell said Tuesday there could be a role for Congress to play here. ""It's certainly something that we need to take a look at,"" McConnell told reporters. ""We'll be talking to our colleagues about what, if anything, is appropriate for us to do in the wake of what's going on."" But the discussion has often become entwined with public outcry over President Trump's handling of the unrest and his threat to use military force to quell protests. Pelosi said Floyd's killing ""happened in broad daylight, it happened for all the world to see. A knee to the neck, not only by the perpetrator of that murder but by three officers observing it."" Congress has often struggled to address policing issues. Many decisions about policing tactics, training and strategies are determined at the state and local level. Pelosi is asking members of the Congressional Black Caucus to sort through the ideas and find legislation that can pass the House where Democrats have enough votes for approval without GOP support. Among the options is a 2015 bill introduced by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that would outlaw the use of chokeholds in policing. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has endorsed that idea. Democrats are hoping to reach an agreement quickly. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters he could call lawmakers back to Washington to vote before their scheduled return on June 30. Hoyer said that he has been in contact with the Congressional Black Caucus over the last four days and that it is considering more than 50 pieces of legislation, including a proposal to end qualified immunity for police officers, or their legal protection shield for certain actions. Democrats also plan to try to force the Senate to go on record condemning Trump for ""ordering federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against Americans who were peaceably protesting"" Monday outside the White House. The resolution, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would also affirm the rights of free assembly and protest while condemning looting. The measure is unlikely to pass as it requires unanimous consent to be approved. Republicans, including McConnell, have largely focused on calling for protests to remain peaceful without directly discussing the conflict at the White House. ""It is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace in our streets and peace in our communities,"" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""We need to unite against these violent rioters who seek only to aggrandize themselves and further damage a nation that needs healing."" Most Senate Republicans declined Tuesday to discuss the tear gas incident at the White House when reporters on Capitol Hill asked them about it. Some avoided the question; others said they didn't see the incident. Those who did speak to reporters mostly focused on condemning violent protests. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has announced a June 16 hearing on police use of force. ""We intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd's death, with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation,"" Graham said in a statement Friday. ",0.0
1623723257,2020-06-02 16:51:00,6 Atlanta Officers Charged After Release Of 'Disturbing' Arrest Video,https://www.kios.org/post/6-atlanta-officers-charged-after-release-disturbing-arrest-video,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"Six Atlanta police officers are facing a slew of charges for their role in the arrest of two young people last weekend. The incident, during which officers used stun guns on the pair and pulled them from their vehicle, received national attention after bystanders recorded and posted video to social media. ""I agree with Mayor [Keisha Lance] Bottoms and I agree with our police chief, Erika Shields, when they both have conveyed in so many separate ways that the conduct in this incident — it is not indicative of the way that we treat people in the city of Atlanta,"" Fulton County, Ga., District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters Tuesday. Howard's office has filed charges — mostly assorted aggravated assault and battery counts — against a half-dozen officers involved in the arrest: Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Streeter and Gardner have been fired from the force since Saturday's confrontation, while three others have been placed on desk duty. Howard said the charges are backed up by extensive interviews with the young couple, Taniyah Pilgrim and Messiah Young, as well as video evidence from bystanders and the officers' body camera footage. The district attorney played one such video from a bodycam. During the video, officers on foot confront Pilgrim and Young, who had been passing them in a car. After the two black occupants appear to drive away briefly from the officers, Pilgrim and Young stop — at which point the officers swarm the vehicle. Stun guns are used on both occupants, who are ripped from the car over Pilgrim's screams to stop. Pilgrim was never charged; Young was charged with attempting to elude officers before the charge was dismissed at the request of the mayor, who apologized. ""We just need to see that all officers are held accountable, and that there really is change moving forward within the culture of policing,"" Young said at a news conference. Atlanta and other cities have seen widespread protests over the past week after another video — that of George Floyd's arrest in Minneapolis — catalyzed outrage over violence in policing. Floyd died after Derek Chauvin — who has since been fired from the Minneapolis police and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter — dug a knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Video of the incident involving Pilgrim and Young caused a stir of its own. ""We understand our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" the Atlanta mayor said Sunday, describing the video as ""disturbing on many levels."" ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.""  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In dozens of cities yesterday, large, mostly peaceful demonstrations devolved into chaos. In Nashville, Miami, Seattle and Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, New York and, frankly, too many other places to name, protesters expressed their rage at the death of George Floyd, police brutality and racism. There were violent confrontations with police, and police cracked down, also violently. There were also mass arrests and injuries among demonstrators, journalists and police. At least a dozen major cities declared curfews. Others called on the National Guard, which has been historically used in response to major civil unrest. There were scenes of National Guard marching through some residential neighborhoods, ordering people to stay inside. We go now to Los Angeles, where members of the National Guard were also deployed overnight and a curfew was put in place as a state of emergency was declared. NPR's Nathan Rott is in LA, and he joins us now. Nate, walk us through what happened yesterday. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: So there was a massive peaceful protest that started around noon yesterday. It was in the Fairfax district in west L.A., which is kind of a trendy neighborhood with high-end retail and a big outdoor mall. And people were protesting against police violence, as they are all over the country. They were memorializing George Floyd, the black man who died after being pinned to the ground by Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, by all accounts, it was peaceful, respectful until a little later in the afternoon, when we started seeing reports of police cars being set on fire and just a total breakdown in the situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This often happens at protests, right? When things shift as things go into the night. Do we know what happened? ROTT: Yeah. And that - honestly, that was a little surprising, Lulu. Usually, these, like, shifts do happen at night. And this started in broad daylight in mid-afternoon, which is, I think, very concerning to a lot of the city officials. So, you know, on social media, people were blaming the police for escalating tensions, for responding with tear gas and the sort of militarized riot gear that has become so commonplace around the country. City officials have so far blamed bad eggs in the crowd for setting things off, and that's something we've been hearing in a lot of places - that it's a small group of people who are agitating these situations. Of course, that's now been politicized, even with the U.S. attorney general blaming anarchists and leftists without, you know, providing any proof of that. But it's really hard to say what makes this situations shift. Tensions are obviously very high, so it doesn't take much to spark something. GARCIA-NAVARRO: No, it doesn't. We saw videos of looting and fires in many cities around the country last night. That was also the case in LA, right? ROTT: Yeah. A number of retail stores in that Fairfax area were broken into. Goods were stolen. Some were set on fire. I know firefighters were dealing with those fires throughout the night. That prompted LA's mayor, Eric Garcetti, to announce a citywide curfew, which caught a lot of people off guard because he announced it an hour before it went into effect. But here he is explaining why they did it and alluding to violent protests in 1992 following Rodney King. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: We've seen this before in Los Angeles. When the violence escalates, no one wins. And so everybody has to be responsible for owning this moment. Whether you wear a badge or whether you hold a sign, I'm asking all of Los Angeles to take a deep breath and to step back for a moment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does it seem like the curfew worked briefly? ROTT: Yeah, the crowds started to thin out even before the curfew started. I know in other parts of the state - Sacramento, San Diego - there were large confrontations between crowds and police. I think, you know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Nate Rott in LA. Thank you so much. ROTT: Yeah. Thank you, Lulu.

1623730655,2020-06-02 19:26:49,GOP senators offer rare rebuke of Trump on church visit,https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/GOP-senators-offer-rare-rebuke-of-Trump-on-church-visit--570968061.html,en,True,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"A handful of GOP senators spoke out Tuesday against President Donald Trump, criticizing his visit to a church after police removed peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House. The remarks came even as most Republicans continued to avoid any disapproval of the president. President Donald Trump holds a Bible as he visits outside St. John's Church across Lafayette Park from the White House Monday, June 1, 2020, in Washington. Part of the church was set on fire during protests on Sunday night. (Source: AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) In a memorable scene captured live on television, police cleared Lafayette Park so Trump could walk to nearby St. John's Church and pose with a Bible. Trump's actions drew widespread condemnation from Democrats and religious leaders who said he was misusing the Bible and the church where presidents have prayed for more than 150 years. Some Republicans joined in the criticism on Tuesday. ""There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property ... but there is a fundamental — a Constitutional — right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop,'' said Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said Trump's visit to the church was unhelpful and not something Scott would have done. ""Obviously, if your question is, should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo-op, the answer is no,"" Scott told Politico Tuesday, while noting he did not personally see the incident. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it was ""painful to watch peaceful protesters be subjected to tear gas in order for the president to go across the street to a church that I believe he's attended only once.'' While Americans are justifiably upset that the historic church was set on fire and vandalized, ""I thought that the president came across as unsympathetic and insensitive,'' she said. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., called Trump's walk to the church ""confrontational"" and said it ""distracted from his important message in the Rose Garden about our national grief, racism, peaceful protests and lawful assembly.'' That message ""was drowned out by an awkward photo op,'' Lankford said. Sasse, who has at times criticized Trump but won his endorsement for reelection, said public officials nationwide ""should be lowering the temperature"" over protests and violence following the death in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minnesota. Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and one has been charged with murder in Floyd's death. ""Police injustice — like the evil murder of George Floyd — is repugnant and merits peaceful protest aimed at change,'' Sasse said, adding that ""riots are abhorrent acts of violence that hurt the innocent.'' Both messages should be heard as Americans work to end violence and injustice, Sasse said. Late Tuesday, Trump addressed his GOP critics. ""You got it wrong!"" he tweeted. ""If the protesters were so peaceful, why did they light the Church on fire the night before? People liked my walk to this historic place of worship!"" The comments by the GOP senators were among the strongest by Republicans following Trump's demand Monday to end the heated protests and his vow to use military force to achieve that if necessary. Republicans have frequently muted any criticism of Trump, and only GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah voted in favor of Trump's impeachment in February. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking GOP senator, said that ""as a general matter, I always think it's a good thing for our elected leaders to be spending time at church.'' Still, Thune said views of Trump's actions were ""going to be in the eye of the beholder. His supporters are going to think ... he was standing up for the things he believes in and they believe in. His detractors are going to say it was a photo op.'' Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump likely ""thought this would be some unifying message, but of course it was for half the country, and the other half were outraged by it. And that's just where we are, sadly."" On Trump's threat to send in the military to quell violence, Cornyn and Thune said they hope Trump does not resort to that. While Trump ""arguably"" has the authority to use military force, ""so far he hasn't done it,'' Cornyn said. ""Hopefully, he won't do it. It won't be necessary. And we will try to bring some peace back to our communities."" Thune said he would ""prefer that these things be handled by the state and local authorities. You want to de-escalate, rather than escalate."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday that ""Democrats' obsession with condemning President Trump"" was blinding them to more urgent priorities, such as ""ending the riots or advancing racial justice.'' McConnell condemned rioting in his home city of Louisville and other cities, even as he said the nation is united in horror and opposition to Floyd's death. ""The legitimate and important voices of peaceful protesters will never be heard over the wailing of fire alarms, the smashing of plate-glass windows, and the sirens of ambulances coming for police officers who have been assaulted or shot in the head,'' McConnell said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he was glad Trump went to a ""historic church in our capital city that was firebombed by terrorists. It was important for the president to be there and say we will not be cowed by terrorists. All of us have a First Amendment right to speak, but you don't have a right to burn a church.'' Collins, who is considered one of the Senate's most vulnerable incumbents, said that at a time when the president ""ought to be trying to calm the nation,"" Trump did not do that. __ Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor, Mary Clare Jalonick and Padmananda Rama contributed to this story.

In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held primary elections to decide a series of state and federal contests, including the 2020 presidential race . With no real competition, Biden and President Donald Trump easily won their respective primary elections in Indiana, Rhode Island, Maryland, New Mexico, Montana and the night's biggest prize: Pennsylvania. Biden also won South Dakota. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed in some cases, brushing up against curfews in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. Officials in both places said voters wouldn't be arrested for breaking curfew, but thousands of protesters defied the mayors' orders at the same time, setting up a potential clash with law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops patrolling the streets during a fifth night of social unrest. Pennsylvania, which offered the day's biggest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground. Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations. “Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said. Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination. If he doesn't secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month. Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway. “People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,” Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party's platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests. Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday. “Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.” Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections, Idaho and Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and is now focused on other offices. “We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.” ___ Associated Press writer Rodrique Ngowi in Providence, R.I., and Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, Fla., contributed to this report. ___ Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.” ___ This story has been corrected to show there are nine states voting, not seven.

1623731821,2020-06-02 19:05:00,"Don't Send U.S. Military To Protests, Hill Democrats Warn Trump",https://www.kios.org/post/dont-send-us-military-protests-hill-democrats-warn-trump,en,False,,306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"Democratic leaders in Congress inveighed Tuesday against what they described as a push by President Trump to use the U.S. military for cracking down on nationwide protests triggered by George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis while he was in police custody. ""Violence has no place and violence must be addressed,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told NPR's All Things Considered. ""But there is no reason for the U.S. military to be called out for this."" Pelosi was referring to a threat Trump made Monday evening in the Rose Garden at the White House. ""If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents,"" Trump declared in a brief statement, ""then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" As the president spoke, federal officers in riot gear near the White House launched tear gas and pepper spray at peaceful protesters. Shortly thereafter, Trump strode through a park cleared of the demonstrators to pose with a Bible in front of St. John's Church, leading a group of officials that included Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Walking like lapdogs behind a five-time draft dodging coward who is more interested in looking like a leader than actually being one,"" Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who lost both legs in combat as a military helicopter pilot in Iraq, said of Esper and Milley, ""sends a horrifying message to our troops — including our black and brown troops — that our military's leaders will not protect them from unlawful orders."" In a statement on Twitter, Duckworth added, ""We cannot allow any Commander in Chief to put our Armed Forces' reputation as the last institution Americans can trust and respect at risk by using them unlawfully and putting them in a position of exacerbating the divisions driving our union apart. ... Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not Presidential, it's tin-pot dictatorial."" But Trump does appear to have the power unilaterally to dispatch active-duty soldiers to trouble spots in the United States. The 1807 Insurrection Act authorizes a U.S. president to deploy military forces for domestic emergencies. The law was updated in 2006 to include natural disasters and terrorist attacks as grounds for sending federal troops to restore order. While condemning looting and vandalism that rocked Providence, R.I., on Monday evening, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, called Trump's threats to use military force against American citizens ""irresponsible and destablizing."" ""The job of bringing calm will take law enforcement and the community working together,"" Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. ""It will not come from recklessly invoking the Insurrection Act."" The Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee told reporters Tuesday he plans to convene an in-person congressional hearing next week to press the Pentagon's top two officials on Trump's possible invocation of the Insurrection Act. ""We need to hear from Chairman Milley and Secretary Esper as to exactly how they intend to use the U.S. military trying to deal with this domestic crisis,"" U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said on a video conference call. ""If the president is basically threatening to use the U.S. military to go in and enforce the law in U.S. cities, that runs the risk of an extreme escalation in violence and of a hugely disruptive practice."" Asked about Milley wearing camouflage fatigues in public Monday night, Smith said the nation's highest military officer may have misread the message being sent. ""The optics of him being in uniform out there might not have been so bad if we didn't have the president out there talking about going to war with the country and using the military and using overwhelming force,"" Smith said of Milley. In a conference call Monday, Trump told the nation's governors that Milley was ""a fighter, a war hero, a lot of victories and no losses and he hates to see the way it's being handled in the various states, and I just put him in charge."" Milley, whom Trump said was on the call, said nothing. But a senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that the Insurrection Act had not been invoked by Trump and insisted that Milley's role and authorities have not changed.

The memorial honors George Floyd, the Minneapolis man killed by a police officer. That officer has been charged with third degree murder. It also remembers other African-Americans across the nation killed at the hands of police ""What happened to Mr. Floyd is wrong and the others who are represented here today in this memorial. And it is part of institutionalized racism,"" Bliemeister said.The symbolic gesture builds on a remarkable scene in that unfolded front of the State Capitol Monday evening. A tense standoff between hundreds of protesters and state trooper and national guard soldiers in riot gear ended peacefully. Protest organizers negotiated with Patrol Major Mike Jahnke. Law officers retreated into the Capitol and Jahnke agreed to kneel with protesters for nine minutes, the length of time the Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck.""It felt like change is happening in our society even if it was a little act,"" said Dupree Prentice, a protester who talked with Jahnke.Ishma Yusaf Valenti of the Malone Center said he understands the anger. ""We hear your voices. We're not going to let your protests be in vain. We're going to create real change. Real actions and solutions,"" Valenti said.He said they have been working with the Chief Bliemeister and have come up with a plan called ""Hold Cops Accountable."" He said they will release more details on Wednesday.""The community members will have that role of being heard and being able to hold cops accountable,"" Valenti said.Bliemeister said this is a start.""We are not afraid of the accountability. We want the accountability. And I know our staff does too,"" Bliemeister said.

We will not support a platform that incites violence, racism and lives hashtag black lives matter. Frank told CNBC the companies were in final negotiations on a six figure content partnership is at his company would have netted hundreds of thousands of dollars in the deal, which would have provided free therapy to some users. But Frank said he'd be willing to reopen discussions if Facebook improved its methods for moderating content. In the wake of the protests surrounding George Floyd's death, Trump shared a post saying. When the looting starts, the shooting starts. Twitter added labels saying it violated Twitter's rules about glorifying violence and move. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg openly disagreed with telling Fox News. I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbitrator of truth of everything that people say online. On Monday, there was a virtual walk out among Facebook employees who felt Trump's post violated their platform standards Advertisement Tensions rise among Facebook staff as Mark Zuckerberg gives explanation for inaction on President Trump posts Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: Facebook loses deal over its reaction to trump ‘looting’ post, employees stage virtual walkoutFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought Tuesday to ease employee outrage over his inaction on incendiary remarks recently posted by President Donald Trump.During a company-wide town hall, Zuckerberg struggled to explain his decision-making process as many of his employees, using a real-time feedback tool, reminded him of promises to remove content that calls for violence or that could lead to imminent physical harm.""It's crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us,"" Brandon Dail, an engineer at Facebook, tweeted as the town hall was taking place.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN Business that open and honest discussion ""has always been a part of Facebook's culture.""""Mark had an open discussion with employees today, as he has regularly over the years,"" Stone said. ""He's grateful for their feedback.""The meeting has threatened to ratchet up tensions at Facebook, which has been hit with allegations of right-wing bias from conservatives and criticized by others for tacitly condoning the spread of hate and racism.Another Facebook employee told CNN Business they found Zuckerberg's answers to staff questions at the town hall lacking, and said the CEO risked alienating more of his staff rather than addressing their concerns.During the event, Facebook staff shared links to a video of an exchange between Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zuckerberg last October when he said: ""If anyone, including a politician, is saying things that can cause, that is calling for violence or could risk imminent physical harm ... we will take that content down.""At one point, roughly 22,000 people had tuned into the live video feed, according to another Facebook worker who was watching the stream. The figure reflects nearly half of the company's 48,000 employees.The top question for Zuckerberg, which called for changes to the company's stance on political speech, received more than 5,400 votes from workers, the employee said.Not all employees disagree with Zuckerberg's position, however. One told CNN Business, ""Supporting free speech - especially when you vehemently disagree with what the person is saying - is a hard but important stance needed to make sure everyone can have a voice.""The employee said it is hard to be sure what portion of Facebook's staff supports Zuckerberg's decision. At least a few people with whom they have spoken do support it but are nervous to say so more publicly because they have seen the pushback within the company, the employee said.Tuesday's event follows days of employee activism over Facebook's handling of Trump's content.Some staffers staged a virtual walkout on Monday to protest decisions made by the company's leaders concerning posts by Trump. And at least one worker, software engineer Timothy Aveni, has quit his job, saying it is no longer feasible to ""keep excusing Facebook's behavior.""Facebook's workforce is known for keeping its disputes with executives largely private. But that changed on Friday, when Zuckerberg announced he would not act against content by Trump that Twitter had flagged earlier as having violated its own rules. The decision has prompted widespread criticism within Facebook that has spilled into public, with numerous employees expressing their disagreement on Twitter.One of Trump's posts had claimed, in reference to the demonstrations in Minneapolis, that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — a phrase with racist origins. Trump later professed not to know the history of the phrase, but he allowed the original remark to stand on Facebook and Twitter.Zuckerberg said the content provoked in him a ""visceral negative reaction."" But he justified his decision not to act against the posts, citing his responsibility as the ""leader of an institution committed to free expression.""In the eyes of his harshest internal critics, Zuckerberg had simply caved on prior principled commitments.""Mark can patch this one section of Facebook's policies, but if he derives his principle from the particular actions he wants to take, instead of taking action based on principle, it'll be fruitless in the long run,"" Aveni said in response to a CNN reporter's question on his post.",0.0

The Columbus Police were present at the protest but hung back. At least eight Columbus Police officers and two firefighters stood in front of Slumberland Furniture across the parking lot. ""It's been peaceful, and we're only here to keep them safe. We're not here to show force, we have no issues here, we just want to make sure that everybody gets home safe,"" Columbus Police Sgt.

DEMONSTRATE AND PROTEST WE ARE IN AND HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS LIKE THE FBI. STATE PARTNERS SHARING INFORMATION ISN’T ALWAYS THE CASE IN OTHER STATES. THAT IS THE CASE. THIS IS A TOUGH TIME FOR NEBRASKA. AND I THINK WE ALL WANT TO BRING THIS TO A PEACEFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU, JOE. I’M GOING TO START OFF THE FIRST QUESTION WITH WWT WWT IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION. I G PRIME F 36 SO, IS THERE A CORRELATION? RIGHT NOW WE’RE SEEING WE’RE SEEING A DISTINCTION. THERE IS WHAT IS BEING THE SIGNATURE VOICES ON THE GEORGE FORD INCIDENT SHOULD COME FROM? THE VALLEY IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE THE MALCOLM X FOUNDATION. UP TO THIS POINT WE HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF ARRESTS. A PEOPLE THAT WOULD NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT AT ALL. SO THAT’S THAT’S THE WAY I’LL PARSE OUT MY ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BRIAN. JOE YOU’RE NOT FOLLOWING THE RULES OF THE PROCEDURE HERE. SO I’LL WAIT TILL YOU GET A MICROPHONE. GORDON COUNTY, NEBRASK DO YOU MIND IF I I WOULD BE THE ONE ADVISING THE MAYOR AS TO WHAT’S GOING ON IN AND OUT THERE AND THEN OF COURSE THE MAYOR MAKES THE FINAL DECISION, BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT THE CONDITIONS OF THE CITY ARE IF WE FEEL THAT WE NEED TO EXTEND IT THEN I’LL ASK AND THEN THE MARROW MAKE THAT DECISION BUT IT’S ALL GOING TO BE TOWARDS IS ORDER RESTORED IN THE CITY. ARE WE BACK TO NORMAL? AND I THINK SAFE TO RESUME. THOSE ARE THE VERY SIMPLE GUIDELINES. I JUST WANT TO SAY WE WE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS VERY VERY SERIOUSLY THERE HAS NOT BEEN A CURFEW ISSUED IN THE CITY OF OMAHA SINCE PJ MORGAN WAS MAYOR. IT HAS BEEN QUITE A WHILE AND WORK WITH OUR LAW DEPARTMENT VERY CAREFULLY BECAUSE WE EVEN ASKED, YOU KNOW, CAN YOU DO IT FOR PARTS OF TOWN? OH, WELL, IF YOU DO A CURFEW IT HAS TO BE FOR THE ENTIRE CITY OF OMAHA. I HAVE THE ABILITY AND THE AUTHORITY AFTER I DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY. I COULD DO THAT FOR 72 HOURS. AND THAT’S WHY WE SAID THIS CURFEW WILL LAST FOR 72 HOURS ANYTHING BEYOND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND GET THEIR APPROVAL TO DO ANY STATE OF EMERGENCY. AND A CURFEW BEYOND 72 HOURS, SO THAT’S WHY WE PICKED THE 72 HOURS, BUT DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION AND WHAT’S GOING ON. I MAY NEED TO GO ASK ASK THE CITY COUNCIL TO EXTEND THAT. BOAT KNOW WHAT THEY’RE GOING TO DO IS WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSULTATION CONSULTATION WITH THE GENERAL MOHAWK. NEBRASKA NATIONAL GUARD THEY’LL BE EMBEDDED WITH US AND THEY WILL ALLOW US TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND THEY’LL BE BE THERE AS A SUPPORT POLE. FOR INSTANCE YOU’RE GOING TO STILL SEE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT. INTERACTING AND DEALING WITH EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON WITHIN THE NATIONAL GUARD WILL BE A SUPPORT ROLE FOR US AS A RESOURCE MULTIPLIER THAT WE NEED AT THIS POINT TIME JOE. APPRECIATE THIS THOSE QUESTIONS. CAN I GO TO YOU NEXT CHRIS WITH A CAIFA BE YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP? EARLIER TODAY THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT DESIGNATED AS THEY ANTI-FOG AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. TWO QUESTIONS ONE. HAVE YOU FOUND EVIDENCE OF THEM COORDINATING? AND WHAT RESOURCES DOES THAT BRING TO BEAR AS YOU TRY TO IRON THIS OUT AND MAYBE SEARCH FOR MORE IMPORTANT? SO WE HAVEN’T FOUND A DIRECT CONNECTION, BUT THAT’S ALSO WHY I’VE ASKED THE FBI TO ASSIST US WITH GOING THROUGH OUR ARREST LIST. SO THAT’S WHY WE ARE COMMUNICATING CLEARLY ON FRONT OF THAT FRONT. THE SECOND QUESTION REALLY WILL COME INTO PLAY ONCE WE CAN VERIFY CERTAIN FACETS OF WHAT THAT BACKGROUND WILL GO INTO BUT WE’RE WE’RE SO EARLY INTO THIS. WE HAVEN’T DONE THAT YET. K.MICHELLE BANDU WHAT ARE YOU HEARING? WHAT CHANGES CAN BE MADE IN IT? SO WHAT CHANGES CAN ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE TO MAKE IT BETTER? FIRST OF ALL MICHELLE I ALWAYS SAY THAT WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE. HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EVERYBODY ARE KNEELING TOGETHER ON THIS. THERE’S NOT A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS THE WHAT TOOK PLACE ON THAT INCIDENT. SO THAT’S A BEAUTIFUL STARTING POINT FOR US. AND I WAS LIKE A COMMON GROUND TO START TO SPRINGBOARD THINGS ON. AND WITHIN ALL THE LAYERS THAT THAT WE CAN DO THAT I COULD PROBABLY TALK FOR FOUR DAYS ON INTERNAL THINGS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT. BUT LET’S FOCUS TODAY ON THE COMMON GROUND OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BUILD UP FROM THAT. AND IF THERE’S ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THAT I’LL STEP ASIDE. I JUST WANTED TO BRING UP TO THAT. NO, WE ALL AGREE. I DON’T THINK THERE’S ANY POLICE OFFICER IN OMAHA. THAT DOESN’T FEEL LIKE THERE SHOULD BE JUSTICE BUT DEMONSTRATING AND DESTROYING PUBLIC PROPERTY AND OMAHA. NEBRASKA IS NOT GOING TO BRING JUSTICE. DID GEORGE FLOYD THAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN UP IN MINNEAPOLIS MINNESOTA, BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT SINCE I HAVE BEEN MARRIED ALMOST SEVEN YEARS NOW. I HAVE SEEN THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT CHIEF SCHMADERER IN HIS COMMAND STAFF. THEY’RE STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY MAKE REMARKABLE PROGRESS ON COMMUNITY-POLICE RELATIONS. THEY HAVE WORKED VERY HARD ON IT. THEY BELIEVED IN COMMUNITY POLICING THEY ARE OUT THERE WORKING AND ENGAGING THE PUBLIC ALL OF THE TIME. I THINK WE’VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS. I’M AND EARLIER THE DEATH OF CARRIER. RASCA OROSCO IT BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER IN OMAHA. NOT JUST THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, BUT THE ENTIRE CITY THERE WAS GOOD THAT CAME OUT OF THAT TRAGEDY AND EVERYBODY IN OMAHA FOR A WHILE WAS WEARING THE SUPPORT BLUE T-SHIRTS. SO GENERALLY I FEEL LIKE THE WORK THEY’VE ALREADY DONE HAS REALLY IMPROVED POLICE-COMMUNITY RELATIONS. WE CAN ALWAYS IMPROVE BUT GENERALLY THE PEOPLE IN OMAHA RESPECT THE JOB THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT DOES I MENTIONED THIS THE OTHER DAY WE VERY FEW ARE COMPLAINTS THAT COME TO US FOR EXCESSIVE FORCE. GENERALLY. THERE’S A LOT OF SUPPORT AND A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT. THAT’S WHY IT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THIS VIOLENCE IS NOT COMING FROM FELLOW OMAHA’S THAT A LOT OF THIS VIOLENCE IS BEING IN CITED BY OTHERS WHO JUST WANT TO HAVE A VOICE BUT HAVING A VOICE IN VIOLENCE IS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. SO WE ARE WE’RE ALL LISTENING AND WE UNDERSTAND AND WE ALL AGREE AND WE ALL FEEL THE SAME WAY THERE. TO BE JUSTICE AND WE FEEL WHAT HAPPENED IN MINNESOTA WAS TERRIBLE, BUT JUSTICE IS NOT VIOLENCE IN THE CITY OF OMAHA, AND WE’VE GOT TO MOVE FORWARD AND WE’VE GOT TO UNITE TOGETHER AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER. WE WILL ALWAYS ALWAYS STRIVE TO BE BETTER. IF ANYBODY SAYS WE’RE AS GOOD AS WE CAN BE THE FIRST ONE TO SAY WERE WRONG, BUT WE WILL ALWAYS STRIVE TO BE BETTER, BUT I THINK THAT THEY HAVE MADE REMARKABLE PROGRESS AND I WANT TO SEE THAT PROGRESS CONTINUE. DOCTOR THANK YOU. ALSO MICHELLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE’VE BEEN DOING IN MY ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO REACHING OUT TO LEADERS IN NORTH AND SOUTH OMAHA. OBVIOUSLY BEEN WORKING WITH REGARD TO THIS PANDEMIC. WE’VE HAD CONVERSATIONS THOUGH ALSO ABOUT DIRECTOR FRAKES HAVING PHONE CALLS WITH TIME VANDANA CAN’T DO A MEET IN PERSON MEETINGS. BUT WITH NORTH OMAHA LEADERS, AND I’D REFER FOLKS TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE PLANNING ON WORKING ON TO THE PRESS RELEASE. WE PUT OUT OVER A WEEK AGO WITH REGARD TO SOME OF THE STEPS. NOT ONLY ADDRESS THE PANDEMIC ISSUES IN NORTH AND SOUTH OMAHA, BUT ALSO WORK ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUES TO BE ABLE TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE IN NORTH AND SOUTH OMAHA. SO THESE ARE THE TYPES OF STEPS THAT WE GOT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS. I JUST ECHO WHAT THE MAYOR SAID THE VIOLENCE IS NOT PUSHING THOSE THINGS FOR WE UNDERSTAND PEOPLE’S CONCERNS AND WE KNOW WE GOT TO DO MORE WE GOT TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE BUT THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER. IN FACT, I THINK IT JUST REALLY JUST WORKS THE OPPOSITE JUST REALLY KIND OF DENIGRATES THE MEMORY OF GEORGE FLOYD WHAT I DON’T THINK HE WOULD HAVE WON. SO HE WOULD HAVE WANTED US TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY MORE RELATING BETTER RELATIONSHIPS TO BE ABLE TO HELP FOLKS WITH HIS IPHONE. MONA I’M GOING TO WITH CHICK WASIKOWSKA FROM CHANNEL 3. WELL, HE WASN’T RELEASED ONCE HE WAS DETAINED. HE’S BEEN IN OUR CUSTODY EVER SINCE. TOM BECC THANK YOU. CHIEF VIDEO OF THE SHOOTING LAST NIGHT. TOM LET ME SAY THIS I’VE BEEN A PRIZE THAT THERE’S SOME VIDEO I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THE LOGISTICS OF THE THE ECOSYSTEM THAT’S PLAYING OUT RIGHT NOW, SO I HAVEN’T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DIVE DEEPLY INTO THAT THE COUNTY ATTORNEY IS INDICATED TO ME THAT HE’LL HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE WHEN HE MAKES HIS DECISION THAT AND THE DECISION TO BOOK OR WE’LL COME FROM THE COUNTY ATTORNEY’S POSITION, BUT HE’S CURRENTLY IN CUSTODY THE OMAHA POLICE DEPARTMENT. WE’RE VERY FORTUNATE THAT WE’RE GOING TO BE RECEIVING MILITARY POLICE. THEY’LL HAVE THEY’LL HAVE THAT EXTRA TRAINING AND THAT MILITARY POLICE BACKGROUND WHICH WOULD BE WHICH IS OUR BEST CASE SCENARIO WHEN IN AND WORKING WITH US. SO THEY’LL BE ARMED AND EVERYTHING JUST LIKE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. CHRIS I CAN TREAT THE INDIVIDUAL FROM OUT-OF-STATE ARRESTED WITH THE BALL TOP COCKTAIL. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT STATE? HE’S FROM COUNT THINGS IOWA COUNCIL BLUFFS, MAYBE. NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE ON THAT, BUT WE’LL GET TO THE PACKET OF WE’RE ALL THAT’S FROM YET ANOTHER QUESTION. YOU’RE WELCOME. CONCERNING THE MURDER LAST NIGHT FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGH WELL I’M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE MURDER INVESTIGATION. OKAY, THEY THE INFRACTIONS THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PANDEMIC. FRACTIONS ARE MAIN THING TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW. LIKE I SAID THE CHARGING DECISION. IT IS THAT COMES FROM THE COUNTY ATTORNEY. I’M THE CHIEF OF POLICE. YOU MAKE THE DETAINMENT COUNTY ATTORNEY MAKES THE CHARGING DECISION. THAT’S THAT’S HOW THAT THAT’S HOW THAT WORKS. OKAY. SO I’M BRIAN MASTER. BRIAN HAVEN’T HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO ANYBODY’S FAMILY AND YOU HEARD ME EARLIER SAY THAT I HAVEN’T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE OF THE ECOSYSTEM OF EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH TO DIVE INTO THAT PARTICULAR CASE CASE TO TO AN INFINITE LEVEL. YOUR TICKET ONE OR TWO MORE QUESTIONS. YES, SIR. WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE? IF PROPERTY OWNERS FEEL THAT THEY NEED TO DO AN EXTRA LEVEL OF PROTECTION A LOT OF THE BUSINESSES ALONG 72ND STREET HAVE ELECTED TO PUT PLYWOOD ON FRONT OF THEIR WINDOWS THINGS LIKE THAT REALIZE THAT WE’VE TAKEN GREAT EXTRA MEASURES AS A CITY HERE TODAY TO TRY TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY’S PROPERTY AND SAFETY IS SECURE. SO THOSE ARE A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING DONE. I DO NOT CONDONE ANY VIGILANTE ACTIONS IF THAT’S THE NATURE OF IN THE PREMISE BEHIND YOUR QUESTION. I DO NOT CONDONE THAT AT ALL. THAT’S THAT’S WHERE IT’S GOING AND I’M NOT SURE IF IT WAS APOLOGIZE IF I HAD LIVED TOO MUCH. LET’S DO. ST.

(AP) -- Both the states of South Dakota and Nebraska have activated the National Guard after protests turned violent over the weekend. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem activated the National Guard after protests in took place in Sioux Fall over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. The Argus Leader reports the protest in South Dakota's largest city started Sunday afternoon with a march downtown. Police said dozens of protesters later congregated at the Empire Mall and began throwing rocks at officers. Several businesses in the area of the Empire Mall had windows damaged. Police said protesters had dispersed by 11 p.m. Noem said about 70 Guard members will remain in the city until they are no longer needed While in Nebraska, officials are imposing a curfew and the Nebraska National Guard is being mobilized to help police after a man was killed during a demonstration in downtown Omaha over the death of George Floyd. The shooting occurred at around 11 p.m. Saturday in the city's Old Market area and within a couple of blocks of where protesters had gathered. Police said they arrested someone within the hour in connection with the shooting of 22-year-old protester James Scurlock. Officials didn't say what led to the shooting during the protests. The protest in downtown Omaha followed one hours earlier a few miles away that started peacefully but devolved into clashes between protesters and police. Over the weekend, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts blasted the Minneapolis police officer's handling of George Floyd. Ricketts says Derek Chauvin's actions are an egregious violation of Floyd's rights, and he says the now-fired officer who placed a knee on Floyd's neck should be charged and tried. Ricketts says the incident reflects poorly on law enforcement and creates more distrust between police and communities of color, and he's encouraging protesters to express their anger peacefully.",0.0

But tragically, the 77 year old Dorn was murdered around 2 30 this morning, he was shot and killed by a Lueder. Dorn was working security at least pawnshop on Martin Luther King Drive. He died on the sidewalk in front of the store. David Dorn was exercising law enforcement training that he learned here. So in his honor, we're wearing our mourning bands, my prayers. But for the family and friends of retired Captain David Dorm, who was murdered last night after retiring from the sale of City Police Department in 2007 doored became police chief in Moline Acres. No matter where Dave Doran worked, people loved him. Retired ST Louis City Police Officer David Ellison says Dorn helped him out of poverty and into a life as a police officer. Dave Doran was a great man. He was fair there, sharpest, cleanest. We came out of the car. His presence was well known and observed, and he meant business when it was time to take care of business. The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in ST Louis, says Dorn was the type of brother that would have given his life to save them if he had. Too many of us younger officers looked up to him. He retired probably in 2004 so very well, like not very pleasant, and his wife still works here and a very sad time for our agency. Advertisement Police: Retired St. Louis police captain killed amid unrest Share Shares Copy Link Copy A retired St. Louis police captain killed by people who broke into a pawn shop after protests turned violent was a gregarious and outspoken leader who mentored youths and insisted on strict ethical conduct among his employees, a longtime colleague said Tuesday.David Dorn, 77, was found dead on the sidewalk in front of Lee's Pawn & Jewelry about 2:30 a.m. Tuesday. No arrests have been made.The shooting and theft apparently was posted on Facebook Live, but the video has since been taken down. It came on a violent night in St. Louis, where four officers were shot, officers were pelted with rocks and fireworks and 55 businesses were burglarized or damaged, including a convenience store that burned. Police also shot and gravely injured a burglary suspect who they say shot at officers.Cities across the U.S. have seen protests and violence since George Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleaded for air.Dorn, who was black, was a friend of the pawn shop’s owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, his wife, St. Louis police Sgt. Ann Marie Dorn, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.David Dorn served 38 years on the St. Louis police force before retiring in October 2007. He then became chief of Moline Acres, a small town in St. Louis County.Former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch knew Dorn for 30 years and said they became close friends when Dorn and his wife were leading the St. Louis police department's Explorers program for young people interested in law enforcement careers, while Fitch was leading the county's program.“He was very dedicated to youth, especially disadvantaged youth,"" said Fitch, who led the St. Louis County Police Department from 2009 to 2014. “He wanted to see them succeed. He wanted to be a role model for those young men and women to go into law enforcement.”Dorn' s personality was “bigger than life,” Fitch said. ""He was a fun guy, a happy guy. You never had to wonder what he was thinking when somebody did something incredibly stupid like a crime because he would just say it as he saw it.”When he took over as chief in Moline Acres, Dorn made it clear that his officers would be held to the strictest of standards, Fitch said.“He wanted them to do the right thing all the time,"" Fitch said.The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in St. Louis, said in a news release that Dorn was “the type of brother that would’ve given his life to save them if he had to.”St. Louis police Chief John Hayden called Dorn a ""fine captain.”“Many of us, the other officers, looked up to him,” Hayden said.

1623834869,2020-06-02 22:00:28,False claims of antifa protesters plague small U.S. cities,https://www.ksnblocal4.com/content/news/False-claims-of-antifa-protesters-plague-small-US-cities-570971781.html,en,True,,268161,nbcneb.com,http://nbcneb.com/,"In the days since President Donald Trump blamed antifa activists for an eruption of violence at protests over police killings of black people, social media has lit up with false rumors that the far-left-leaning group is transporting people to wreak havoc on small cities across America. The speculation was being raised by conservative news outlets and pro-Trump social media accounts, as well as impostor Facebook and Twitter accounts. Twitter and Facebook busted some of the instigators behind the unsubstantiated social media chatter. Twitter determined Monday that a tweet promising antifa would “move into residential areas” and “white” neighborhoods was sent by the white supremacy group Identity Evropa. The tweet was shared hundreds of times and cited in online news articles before Twitter removed it Monday, a company spokesperson said. Yet the tweet continued to circulate Tuesday on Facebook and Instagram. Facebook, using information shared by Twitter, announced Tuesday night it also took down a handful of accounts on its platform that were created by whites supremacy groups like Identity Evropa and American Guard, some of them posing as part of the antifa movement. For years, some social media users have tried to delegitimize controversial or political protests with baseless theories that they were organized by wealthy financiers or extremists organizations. Over the weekend, Trump singled out antifa as being responsible for the violent protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd, saying in a tweet: “It’s ANTIFA and the Radical Left.” “Usually you see this when there’s an interest to deflect conversations from protests to just accusing the protests of being violent, organized or having backers that are evil,”said Filippo Menczer, a professor of informatics and computer science at Indiana University. “The president mentioning it, of course, has generated a huge spike.” The theories about antifa — short for “anti-fascists” and an umbrella term for lefitst militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations — have trickled through cities across the country in recent days. Police departments say people are phoning in “tips” they see on social media claiming antifa is sending buses or even planes full of antifa activists to their area. In Payette County, Idaho — a rural county of 24,000 — the calls started early Monday morning after one Facebook user said the sheriff had spotted antifa rioters in the area. The calls didn’t taper off until the sheriff’s office debunked the rumor on Facebook. “It’s really a small community, where our citizens know us pretty well,” said Payette County Sheriff Lt. Andy Creech. “When the post got out there, we started getting phone calls directly.” Meanwhile, Facebook users were also warning their friends to stay clear of a shopping center in a New Jersey suburb, saying it would be the center of antifa destruction on Tuesday. But police had “no credible information” that antifa would be present in the area, Toms River Police Department media specialist Jillian Messina said in an email. The police aren’t aware of anyone showing up at all, she added. Identical Facebook and Twitter posts about busloads of antifa protesters also stumped the Sioux Falls Police Department, where officers in the South Dakota city said they didn’t see any unusual bus activity in town. But the claims still spread for days ahead of a planned protest this Saturday, said Sam Clemens, a public information officer for the department. “Everyone heard there were going to be buses of people,” Clemens said. “It was very specific: there were three busloads.” Even the owner of a Michigan limousine business was forced to refute online rumors when two of his buses became the center of a conspiracy theory that liberal financier George Soros was funneling protesters to Milan, Michigan. Social media users widely shared a manipulated photo of his white buses, edited to show the words “Soros Riot Dance squad” emblazoned on the sides. The buses belong to Sean Duval, the owner of local transportation company Golden Limousine International, and don’t have any words printed on them. Said Duval: “It’s frustrating when people from the outside start instigating and try to turn American against American.” ___ Associated Press writers Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, Calif., Beatrice Dupuy in New York and Ali Swenson in Seattle contributed to this report.

1623844872,2020-06-01 00:00:00,WATCH NOW: Peaceful demonstration draws dozens in Scottsbluff,https://www.starherald.com/news/local_news/watch-now-peaceful-demonstration-draws-dozens-in-scottsbluff/article_832b0bfa-790f-5d43-b811-457652019f99.html,en,False,,30505,starherald.com,http://www.starherald.com#spider,"Dozens of demonstrators walked the streets of Scottsbluff Sunday afternoon in an effort to bring awareness to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. Organizers of two Scottsbluff rallies prioritized a peaceful demonstration after many similar protests had turned violent across the country over the past several days. One group met at the Guadalupe Center for a march through the city’s streets. A second group organized by Panhandle Equality met at Centennial Park for a candlelight vigil. Once the vigil was complete, many participants from that event joined the marchers. Floyd, who was black and was handcuffed, died after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, used his knee to pin down Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving. Chauvin and the other three officers who took part in the arrest of Floyd, who was suspected of passing a counterfeit bill, were fired May 26. Chauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter charges, but the other three officers haven’t been charged. Jose Gonzales, one of the organizers for the Guadalupe Center rally, said he has seen the protests that have turned to looting and violence, but he believes another message needed to be sent. “We are with America,” Gonzales said, “but we need to be the voice saying, ‘Hey, this is not right. We need to start cleaning things up.’ How can we tell people they need to clean up their back yard if we’re not doing it ourselves.” Panhandle Equality vice president Megan Koppenhafer said the fact that the vigil was organized separately from the Guadalupe Center event and both were scheduled for the same time on the same day was “serendipity.” “We wanted to raise awareness for the ways in which our community here is not immune to what’s happening on a global level,” Koppenhafer said. “The sooner we can talk about it, the more proactive we can be in preventing things like what happened in Minneapolis. “We wanted to show our neighbors and our community here that there are more people who love and support them and will stand with them than there are who won’t. There’s a lot of fear around speaking up in this community. I talked to a lot of people who said that seeing as many people show up for them as did (Sunday) was impactful in terms of helping our whole community see that there’s all people in our community. We’re not just western Nebraska. We’re not just one thing. There’s a community for anybody who needs one here.” Gonzales said good police officers far outweigh the bad, but often they get unfairly lumped together, the same way good citizens can get lumped together with bad ones. “In society, if you’re in a gang, you’re in a gang,” he said. “You’re guilty by association, so to speak. The guys know who the bad guys are in the precinct. They know who they are, they just don’t say anything. Why not? That’s where the problem is. That’s where we’ve got to fix our justice system. The inconsistency of it all is upsetting.” Gonzales said he was upset by watching video of Floyd’s death. “What shook me to the core is that man yelling for his deceased mother,” Gonzales said. “That shook me, man. I’m a human being. Even I was like, ‘Let him up,’ (even) knowing it was a recording, just feeling that. Let him up, man. He was killing him in front of everybody.” Organizers focused on ensuring Sunday’s protests were peaceful but still got the message across was important for those involved. “To show everywhere else what peace is in a protest,” demonstrator Alyssa Gomez said when asked the purpose of the march, “and to help bring us together — not just us Mexicans or blacks ... We’re here for George Floyd, really, to bring the community together, peacefully. Not to be crazy. Hopefully, we teach other states and towns how this should be done. We understand because we’re all angry about it, but at the same time, we’ve got to do what we’ve got to do in our town.” Scottsbluff police chief Kevin Spencer said he was pleased with how the demonstrators conducted the march. The marchers stayed on sidewalks to prevent any traffic disruptions. “I think it was peaceful, just like they said it was going to be,” Spencer said. “We really are appreciative of that. Hopefully, they’ve exercised their right, and they are helping to make a difference. We respect them for doing that. We just want to keep the community safe and make sure that (the demonstrators) are safe, too. Jack Warren said he participated in the rally Sunday because he believed what happened to Floyd was wrong, and similar incidents have been too frequent. “I believe that when you’re silent, nothing gets done,” he said. “I believe that a peaceful march is probably the best way to show our solidarity with the people who are affected by it most.” Although Floyd’s death was at the hands of police in Minnesota, the repercussions are still important in Nebraska. “It affects all of us because there are so many people of color in this community,” Warren said. “I think that if we don’t speak up about it, it won’t change elsewhere, and it could happen here. I think that people everywhere need to speak up for it.” Gonzales said that using violence to protest violence is a process that can only create more pain on both sides. “The number one thing is an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.” Gonzales said. “We have to be level with everybody. We do not support the rioting and everything like that. ... We want Americans to know, we’re Americans and we’re with you. We’ve got you, even in little town Scottsbluff, Nebraska. We can be heard, too.”",0.0

The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the months long state-by-state primary season.Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March.Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground.Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations.“Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said.Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.”Related video: Joe Biden addresses civil unrest over police brutality of black men and womenVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party.The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment.Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day.At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests.Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday.“Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.”Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines.Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year.“We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.”",0.0

Most of those who spoke believe Gray's resolution was a positive step that must be one of many to improve the lives of minority communities in Omaha and across the country.One by one, dozens of citizens stepped up to the microphone, one after another -- many airing their frustrations.""I'm so hurt right now, because I haven't slept in days,"" David Mitchell said.""This cannot go on any longer. We are tired of seeing innocent black men and women dead on the news,"" Mekhi Mitchell saidMost of the public speakers expressed their support for agenda item 78, Gray's resolution.""I am deeply saddened by what has happened the last several days. We need to be better. We need to be better,"" Jamie Sass said.Following days of outrage and protest in Omaha, which followed the events in Minneapolis, Gray told the audience gathered inside council chambers his second reason for writing the resolution.""My other reason for putting this resolution on the agenda was so that you could all be here to speak, because far too often, people whose voices we don't hear get silenced,"" he said.Others, like Tameka Mees, said the resolution was a small step in the right direction, but argued more needs to be done to change the system.""I agree that we should stand in solidarity against racism, bigotry, systemic oppression... (but) implement new laws, updated policy and procedures, with fairness and justice for all citizens,"" she said.Gray later said he wanted those silenced voices to join in the healing process.""I appreciate that all of us who are people of color are in pain, and that pain needs to stop, and the only way that pain is going to stop is for us to recognize that we have a long way to go,"" he said.",0.0

But action demanded and grievances aired by citizens went far beyond Tuesday’s agenda items. “You guys hold the keys to our lives in this community. If we’re going to meet for George Floyd, meet for George Floyd in Minnesota,” said Malik Cotton, speaking about a resolution to recognize reckless policing killed George Floyd. “Meet here, right now, for James Scurlock. Meet here for James. Why are we not here for James?” The gallery of masked citizens erupted in applause at the name of the 22-year-old who died Saturday night during a downtown protest after a bar owner there shot him. On Monday the Douglas County Attorney deemed the shooter, Jake Gardner, was justified in his actions because he feared for his life. Advertisement In testimony for the resolution to recognize and grieve Floyd’s death, which passed unanimously, citizens expressed frustration over the state of race relations in Omaha and questioned where the city, its citizens and leaders, should go from here. For Tamika Mease, the proximity of the Scurlock’s killing to where a white mob lynched Willie Brown a little more than a century ago, was a coincidence too striking. “It’s a reminder, and it’s like it’s happening all over again. And we’re tired,” said Tamika Mease. “We’re tired and we’re frustrated, and we are demanding change. We’re willing to work together. Be willing to work with us. But change has to come.” Tamika Mease addresses the Omaha City Council on June 2, 2020. Councilman Ben Gray, of District 1, said he knows the resolution, which he introduced is not enough. He introduced the resolution so the city can respond to the violence many witnessed as a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. But Gray also brought forth the issue to hear the community speak. Conversations like these, and additional initiatives Gray said are incoming—from city and county government as well as at least eight CEO’s he’s spoken to—are small steps to accomplish that. Advertisement “Have we done enough, absolutely not,” Gray said. “Do we need to do more, absolutely. But in this particular instance what we need to do is stay focused on what’s ahead of us. and what’s ahead of us is the tremendous work of addressing institutional racism.” One person was scheduled to speak in opposition to the resolution but did not appear when called by the city council. The council also voted 5-1 to extend the city’s state of emergency for another week. Mayor Jean Stothert enacted the state of emergency on May 31. Deputy Chief of Police Greg Gonzalez said this will give the city flexibility in a time where it’s still seeing unrest. Stothert’s Chief of Staff Marty Bilek said this will allow the city to return to normal faster. But others said the extension sends a bad message. “We don’t want to get back to normal, that’s not what we’re trying to do,” said Scott Williams who said extending the state of emergency extension would only antagonize people further. “That’s what I mean when I say this decision is tone deaf.” Adam Sipple, legal director for the ACLU of Nebraska, also opposed the bill saying the extension is dangerous as it would ban gatherings of more than 25 people and diminish people’s First Amendment rights. City Councilmember Ben Gray, of District 2, addresses citizens on Tuesday, June 2, 2020. Councilmembers voiced concerns about extending the state of emergency without knowing the details of the Mayor’s plan. Bilek said there would not be a 25-person limit on gatherings but did not say what the new limit would be. City Councilmember Festersen said there was a communication breakdown when the first state of emergency was enacted and asked that the Mayor’s office be more transparent moving forward. Councilmember Chris Jerram, of District 3, the sole dissenting vote, said extending the order poses risks to right to free speech and peaceful assembly, “risking the deterioration of all other rights.” Jerram also said he worries this will send the wrong message and could escalate a confrontational tone that may lead to violence. “I assume we want to get our city into healing mode as quickly as we can,” Jerram said, “and authorizing a whole nother week without knowing what this would look like is too concerning.” Others who spoke Tuesday, criticized the Douglas County Attorney’s investigation into the death of Scurlock. County Attorney Don Kleine said his office had a consensus that Jake Gardner, who owned two downtown bars until recently, was justified in shooting and killing Scurlock because he was in fear of his life. Gardner had an expired concealed carry license for his gun. Minutes before the incident that ended his life, Scurlock and others had caused property damage, although Kleine said that was immaterial to the case. Kleine showed two pieces of video evidence that made up the bulk of their investigation, the results of which they announced Monday afternoon less than two days after the crime. Their evidence did not show Gardner using racial slurs or antagonizing anyone, as had been suggested on social media. Kleine and other officials have asked for people to send them more evidence if they have it. Mekhi Mitchell addresses the Omaha City Council on Tuesday, June 2, 2020. David Mitchell said he went live on Facebook yesterday and asked his more than 2,000 viewers to send him what videos and other evidence they had relating to the crime. His inbox flooded, he said. “Are you telling me Facebook works harder than the county attorney?” Mitchell asked. “Are you serious?” Scurlock’s family and their attorney, State Sen. Justin Wayne, are seeking a grand jury investigation. An online petition has gathered more than 40,000 signatures in under a day while a memorial fund for Scurlock’s family almost $170,000 at this time. Many others spoke out about law enforcement and the National Guard using tear gas, flash bangs, pepper bullets and other crowd control techniques on protesters. Many said protests have been peaceful until police showed up. Some protesters have thrown items like water bottles and eggs at officers as well as destroying property at 72nd and Dodge streets and downtown, but people say that pales in comparison to what they’ve seen the past few nights. “Does violence mean the destruction of property? I don’t believe so,” said William Kay. “I think violence means the destruction of human bodies and human lives. The value of a human life could never compare to the value of property.” Many also lobbied criticism at members of the city council. Some said they need to attend the protests and stay until after curfew to see what happens. Others said they need to get serious about change or resign for other people who want to do their job. Similar sentiment spilled over into testimony on a separate resolution to establish a Hate Intimidation offense. The ordinance would make hate crimes enforceable by both state law and municipal code as well as increasing the inclusivity of a hate crime’s definition. The ordinance started taking form in late 2019 when city officials saw Charleston, South Carolina pass similar legislation. Stothert, Chief of Police Todd Schmaderer and Franklin Thompson, the city’s director of human rights and relations, signed on to this draft of the ordinance on May 13 of this year. The ordinance received support on Tuesday from both, Anthony Connor, head of the Omaha Police Officers Association, and Gonzalez called the ordinance “trailblazing.” Pierce Carpenter opposed the ordinance saying there’s no need for the law and that it steps on people’s first amendment rights. Others said the ordinance is symbolic and lacks the specificity to actually prosecute hate crimes. Malik Cotton addresses the Omaha City Council on Tuesday, June 2, 2020. In support of the ordinance people shared stories of discrimination they’ve faced based on race and gender identity. However, many said this is only a small step in fixing systemic issues that have disadvantaged marginalized communities in receiving justice. Other testimony took aim at comments made by Stothert and Gov. Pete Ricketts. Citizens said they didn’t want to return to the way things were before protests erupted last weekend, as Stothert suggested in a Monday press conference. Ricketts also caused controversy when he used the phrase “My problem with you people,” in a meeting with black community leaders on Monday. He has since apologized, saying he chose his words poorly. Above every testimony and pointed statement, though, was the question: Why are we here? Older people asked why it feels like thing haven’t changed since crimes like the 1919 lynching of Willie Brown that occured blocks from where Scurlock died. Young people shared stories of their times they’ve experienced racism and asked what they need to do to fix these problems. A parent of 4-year-old black boy expressed fear for the world their children will grow up in. Councilman Ben Gray said there’s no question this city and society must address racism that affects people of color. There’s no question progress has been made, but the death of Floyd, Scurlock and others, as well as the incendiary reaction that’s taken place nationwide, shows those roots go deep. “People talk about how far we’ve come,” he said. “But we have a long way to go.”",0.0

Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The shrine is a place of prayer for Catholics but welcomes people of all faiths. The Trumps posed for photos in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine and stood silently for a few minutes, hands clasped in front of them. They did not make remarks. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory slammed the presidential visit in a statement shortly before the Trumps' arrival. “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,” Gregory said in a statement. Trump also is scheduled to sign an executive order on international religious freedom on Tuesday. Trump's visit to the shrine comes just one day after he walked across Lafayette Park next to the White House and posed for cameras outside St. John's Episcopal Church, which suffered slight damage after it was set on fire by protesters late Sunday night. Violent protests have erupted in Washington and dozens of other cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died in the custody of police. Former police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Critics hammered Trump because police used tear gas and shields on protesters in Lafayette Park, essentially clearing a path for the president to walk to the historic building known as the church of presidents. The show of force came roughly half an hour before a 7 p.m. curfew was to take effect in Washington. ""Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us,"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said in a speech Tuesday in Philadelphia that the St. John's event proves Trump is ""more interested in serving the passions of his base."" ""When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people’s house, the White House – using tear gas and flash grenades – in order to stage a photo op at a noble church, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said. Church officials protested that Trump did not call them about his plans to visit to St. John's on Monday. Mariann E. Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes St. John’s Episcopal Church, told CNN she was outraged by the use of tear gas to get people out of the way for a photo op. ""The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" she said. Bishop Gregory noted that Saint Pope John Paul II was “an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings"" and ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace."" White House officials said Trump did want to pay his respects to St. John's, which suffered a basement fire during protests Sunday. The president also wanted to leave the White House grounds to prove he was not “in the bunker“ because of the protesters, said one official who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s communications strategy. The president was particularly angry when word got out that the Secret Service escorted him to the bunker of the White House during protests just beyond the gates of the executive mansion on Friday, the official said. After the St. John's visit, the White House put out a statement saying protesters had been repeatedly warned to exit the park ahead of the 7 p.m. curfew. “The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m.curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation’s most historic churches the night before,"" spokesman Judd Deere. ""Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" In a morning tweet less than two hours before his visit to the shrine,Trump took credit for crackdowns in Washington – and Minneapolis. ""D.C. had no problems last night,"" he said. ""Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)."" A couple hundred peaceful protesters gathered down the street from the national shrine ahead of Trump’s arrival, holding up signs and chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter."" Police on the scene wore baseball caps and vests, but not riot gear. As Trump's motorcade arrived, some protesters shouted expletives, and others raised their middle finger. Kathy Warner, a 77-year-old retired teacher, said she was there to honor Floyd’s memory and to protest the president. She held a sign that read ""in solidarity – RIP George Floyd – Black Lives Matter.” Warner said she hoped passing drivers would read the message and “think about the injustice done to African Americans for centuries.” Warner said she has a 49-year-old son and that her heart “hurts for moms whose sons can’t reach that age.” She called Trump’s visit to St. John’s on Monday “obscene” for the way he “poses with the Bible.” Some drivers honked in support as they passed by and shook their fists out their car windows. The shrine to the late Pope John Paul II sits on the site of the former John Paul II Cultural Center, which the Knights of Columbus bought in 2011.

Titled ""Appomattox,"" a statue in Alexandria, Virginia, depicted a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. It was erected in 1889 to honor Confederate soldiers. (Source: Twitter/Justin Wilson/CNN) A wave of Confederate memorial removals that began after a white supremacist killed nine black people at a Bible study in a church in South Carolina in 2015 is again rolling, with more relics of the Old South being removed from public view after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. In Birmingham, where Rudolph lives, the graffiti-covered, pocked base of a massive Confederate monument was all that remained Tuesday after crews dismantled the towering obelisk and trucked it away in pieces overnight. Other symbols came down elsewhere, leaving an empty pedestal in Virginia and a bare flagpole in Florida. Rudolph, whose sister Addie Mae Collins died in the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church, had to see the sight for herself. She lowered a protective face mask to take in the absence of an edifice she long considered a symbol of oppression. ""I'm glad it's been removed because it has been so long, and we know that it's a hate monument,"" said Rudolph, 69. ""It didn't represent the blacks. It just represented the hard times back there a long time ago."" Confederate symbols across the South have been targeted for vandalism during demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death in police custody in Minneapolis. Now, even some of their longtime defenders have decided to remove them. In Alexandria, Virginia, it was the United Daughters of the Confederacy that took action early Tuesday, removing the statue of a soldier gazing south from Old Town since 1889. And outside Tampa, Florida, a Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter lowered a huge Confederate battle flag that has long been flown in view of two interstate highways. Birmingham took down the obelisk a day after protesters tried to remove the monument themselves, during one of the many nationwide protests. Crews were preparing to finish the job by pulling up the base. The monument had been the subject of a protracted court battle between the city and state, which passed a law to protect Confederate icons after rebel monuments were challenged and removed following the killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the city of Birmingham, seeking to fine the city $25,000 for violating the state law. Mayor Randall Woodfin said earlier this week that the fine was more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city. Online fundraising drives have raised more than enough money to pay the fine. The state lawsuit does not specifically ask Birmingham to restore the monument. Work to remove the monument began Monday, which was Alabama's holiday honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was sworn in Montgomery. There, on the same day, someone knocked over a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside a mostly black high school named for him. Four people were arrested on criminal mischief charges, and the toppled statue was removed. In Alexandria, a city spokesman said the United Daughters of the Confederacy informed the city on Monday that it would remove the statue, and the city's only role was to provide traffic support. By morning, the pedestal was all that was left. City officials were not told where the statue was taken. Titled ""Appomattox,"" it depicts a solitary Confederate soldier, his head bowed slightly. In 1890, a state law was passed barring local officials from ever removing it. That law was repealed earlier this year. Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson tweeted photos of the removal on Tuesday, saying ""Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving."" In Birmingham, Rudolph saw the removal of the monument as unfinished business from decades ago. The more than 50-foot-tall (15-meter-tall) memorial to Confederate soldiers and sailors was located just blocks from the church where Rudolph was badly injured and her sister died when a bomb went off on a Sunday morning decades ago. ""The things that we were fighting for in the '60s aren't solved yet,"" said Rudolph, who testified against Ku Klux Klansmen convicted in the bombing. ""We shouldn't be treated the way they treat us."" ___ Associated Press writers Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama; and Matthew Barakat in Falls Church, Virginia; contributed to this report.

But when the Canadian prime minister was asked what he thought of President Trump's actions to quash a wave of protests across the U.S., Trudeau paused before responding – for 21 seconds as the cameras recorded his awkward silence. During a Tuesday news conference in front of his Ottawa residence, the prime minister fielded this question from a reporter: ""You've been reluctant to comment about the words and actions of the U.S. president. But we do have now Donald Trump calling for military action against protesters. We saw protesters tear-gassed yesterday to make way for a presidential photo-op. I'd like to ask you what you think about that. And, if you don't want to comment, what message do you think you're sending?"" Before answering, the prime minister, sporting a beard and shaggy hair since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, glanced down at his lectern, opened his mouth as if to speak — then paused, shifted his weight and uttered a barely audible ""um"" as birds chirped in the background. ""We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,"" he finally said. ""It is a time to pull people together, but it is a time to listen. ""It is a time to learn what injustices continue despite progress over years and decades. But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges,"" he said. ""That black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day,"" Trudeau continued. ""There is systemic discrimination in Canada, which means our systems treat Canadians of color, Canadians who are racialized, as differently than they do others."" Trudeau typically displays reticence on Trump's actions, keeping in mind the centrality of the U.S.-Canada relationship and its huge cross-border economic interdependence. Canada in recent days has seen relatively small, peaceful protests in solidarity with U.S. demonstrations that first erupted last week in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. By contrast, the protests in U.S. cities have typically been much larger and have frequently devolved into clashes between police and activists. The Canadian protests supporting Black Lives Matter have sprung up in Montreal, Halifax, Toronto and Regina, the provincial capital of Saskatchewan. At the protest in Regina on Tuesday, when a few hundred people gathered, one of the organizers, Faith Olanipekun, told the CBC that, ""A lot of people here think that Canada isn't racist."" ""So it's important for us to come out, voice our concerns and let people know that we are suffering in Canada just as much as people in the U.S. are suffering,"" Olanipekun said. ",0.0

FILE - In this June 1, 2020, file photo President Donald Trump departs the White House to visit outside St. John's Church in Washington. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) Both Trump and Defense Secretary Mark Esper also drew stinging, rare public criticism from Trump's first defense secretary, Jim Mattis, in the most public pushback of Trump's presidency from the men he put at the helm of the world's most powerful military. Mattis' rebuke followed Trump's threats to use the military to ""dominate"" the streets where Americans are demonstrating following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. The president had urged governors to call out the National Guard to contain protests that turned violent and warned that he could send in active duty military forces if they did not. Esper angered Trump early Wednesday when he said he opposed using military troops for law enforcement, seemingly taking the teeth out of the president's threat to use the Insurrection Act. Esper said the 1807 law should be invoked in the United States ""only in the most urgent and dire of situations."" He added, ""We are not in one of those situations now."" After his subsequent visit to the White House, the Pentagon abruptly overturned an earlier decision to send a couple hundred active-duty soldiers home from the Washington, D.C., region, a public sign of the growing tensions with the White House amid mounting criticism that the Pentagon was being politicized in response to the protests. Former Secretary Mattis, a retired Marine general, lambasted both Trump and Esper in an essay in The Atlantic Wednesday for their consideration of using the active-duty military in law enforcement — and for the use of the National Guard in clearing out a largely peaceful protest near the White House on Monday evening. ""We must reject any thinking of our cities as a 'battlespace' that our uniformed military is called upon to 'dominate,'"" Mattis wrote, referencing quotes by Esper and Trump respectively. ""Militarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington, D.C., sets up a conflict — a false conflict — between the military and civilian society. "" Trump responded on Twitter by calling Mattis ""the world's most overrated General,"" adding: ""I didn't like his 'leadership' style or much else about him, and many others agree, Glad he is gone!"" Days ago, Esper had ordered about 1,300 Army personnel to military bases just outside the nation's capital as Trump weighed whether to invoke the Insurrection Act and send active-duty troops into the city, the scene of large protests that devolved into violence and looting over the weekend. But after a night of calm enforced by a large deployment of National Guard troops and heavily armed federal law enforcement agents, defense officials said the troops would begin returning to their home base. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told The Associated Press that the decision was reversed after Esper's visit to the White House. The White House didn't respond to request for comment on whether Trump ordered the change. The shift added to confusion over the president's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act for protests following Floyd's death in Minneapolis. White House officials had indicated even before Esper's comments that Trump was backing away from invoking the act, though officials said Trump was upset that Esper's statement conveyed ""weakness."" Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president was still willing to deploy federal troops despite Esper's comments. ""If needed, he will use it,"" she told reporters. ""But at this time he's relying on surging the streets with National Guard. It's worked with great effect."" Meanwhile, the president was taking credit for the deployment of federal and other law enforcement officers to the nation's capital, saying it offered a model to states on how to stop violence accompanying some protests nationwide. On Wednesday evening, troops and others were out in force in Washington. A Defense official said at least 2,200 National Guard members would be on the streets. Helmeted forces formed a ring around Lafayette Park across from the White House. Military vehicles were parked at intersections, also blocking access. Trump argued that the massive show of force was responsible for protests in Washington and other cities turning more calm in recent days and repeated his criticism of governors who have not deployed their National Guard to the fullest. ""You have to have a dominant force,"" Trump told Fox News Radio on Wednesday. ""We need law and order."" Asked repeatedly if Trump still had confidence in his Pentagon chief, McEnany said, ""As of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper, and should the president lose faith we will all learn about that in the future."" Esper, in his Pentagon remarks, also strongly criticized the actions of the Minneapolis police for the incident last week that ignited the protests. He called the death of Floyd ""murder"" and ""a horrible crime."" The defense secretary himself has come under fire from critics, including retired senior military officers, for having walked from the White House on Monday evening with Trump and others for a presidential photo opportunity in front of St. John's Episcopal Church, which had previously sustained damage from protesters. Esper said that while he was aware they were heading to St. John's, he did not know what would happen there. ""I was not aware a photo op was happening,"" he said, adding that he also did not know that police had forcibly moved peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square to clear the way for Trump and his entourage. Mattis, in his essay, called the scene an ""abuse of executive authority."" The retired general quit the Trump administration in December 2018 after months of conflict with the president as Trump announced he was unilaterally withdrawing American troops from Syria. The White House laid responsibility for Monday's events in Lafayette Park on Attorney General William Barr, saying he gave the order for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump's walk to the church ahead of Washington's 7 p.m. curfew. McEnany said the decision was made earlier Monday but had not been executed by the time Barr arrived in the park to survey the scene. He gave the order at that time. McEnany said law enforcement conducted the operation with appropriate force, which included pepper spray and other chemical agents, and officers on horseback and batons clearing a crowd made up almost entirely of peaceful protesters. Trump put a political spin on his criticism of states that have seen violence. He said: ""You notice that all of these places that have problems, they're not run by Republicans. They're run by liberal Democrats."" Though the crackdown on the Washington demonstrations was praised by some Trump supporters Tuesday, a handful of Republicans expressed concern that law enforcement officers risked violating the protesters' First Amendment rights. The situation in Washington had escalated Monday, becoming a potent symbol of Trump's policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. The clampdown followed a weekend of demonstrations outside the White House. Trump had been furious about images juxtaposing fires set in the park outside the executive mansion with a darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials. He was also angry about the news coverage revealing he had gone to the secure White House bunker during Friday's protests. Trump on Wednesday acknowledged he visited the bunker Friday but claimed he was only conducting an inspection as protests raged outside the White House gates.

Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., appeared set to go ahead with a session scheduled before the flare in protests and violence that followed the death of a Minneapolis man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in an incident that reignited long-simmering anger at police in cities across the country. The hearing is scheduled to commence at 10 a.m. ET. Watch it live here. The sole witness is former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who'll likely be grilled about revelations about the Russia investigation that have come to light since he left the Justice Department last year. The political context has evolved: Republicans want to tie former Vice President Joe Biden into what they call the abuses of power from the end of the Obama era. Graham and Republicans want answers about what Rosenstein and other Justice Department leaders knew at the time they were taking fateful decisions about the FBI's investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which sought to hinder Hillary Clinton and help elect then-candidate Donald Trump. Strange days Rosenstein found himself in the center of a political vortex in the spring of 2017, not long after he'd been nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. His boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was a Trump loyalist and had recused himself from the Russian matter. The president had fired FBI Director James Comey. In the midst of that febrile atmosphere, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as a special counsel and continue the Russia investigation. Re-look after re-look has verified Mueller's findings about the Russian interference, but the work of the FBI and Justice Department wasn't found to be problem-free. Issues with the FBI investigators involved and their dealings within officialdom, especially with the secret court that oversees government surveillance, have embarrassed the top levels of federal law enforcement. Longtime target Many Republicans have faulted Rosenstein since his earliest days over his appointment of Mueller. Now, Graham is bringing Rosenstein back to center stage at a time when Trump and other allies want to link Biden with intelligence collection that involved members of the Trump camp. Biden's camp has rejected the idea there were any abuses and pointed out that there was no way for administration officials to single out Americans in intelligence reporting because their names were hidden, or masked. They were only identified after requests for more information about who was talking with existing targets, Biden's campaign said. That practice is legal and takes place thousands of times per year. Trump and allies have made it the basis of political attacks against Biden and others from that era. Biden, in turn, has blasted Trump and Republicans for what he calls their attempt to distract attention from the most pressing challenges of the day — first the coronavirus pandemic and now the national unrest over police violence. Democrats, who are in the minority on the Senate Judiciary Committee, likely will take up that theme on Wednesday. Republicans are likely to press Rosenstein over what they call surveillance abuses and the subsequent findings by investigators about problems with the FBI's practices at crucial junctures in the saga. Rosenstein now is with the law firm King & Spalding but he has appeared before congressional inquisitors before. In the past, Rosenstein has said that he relied on lower-level investigators and attorneys and wasn't involved with the operational details now known to be problematic. Specifically, Rosenstein signed a request to continue surveillance on a former junior campaign aide to Trump, Carter Page, based on work product that has since been repudiated by internal investigators and the secret surveillance court. Those details didn't become clear to the public until later. That likely will be a major area of focus on Wednesday, along with other episodes that have since come to light from the early weeks of the Trump administration. Graham, meanwhile, has sought to show the Judiciary Committee can keep many plates spinning at once. The committee heard from witnesses on Tuesday about the deadly effects of the coronavirus within the federal prison system, and Graham also has planned a hearing later this month about policing, as a result of Floyd's death.

Protesters gather at a memorial for George Floyd where he died outside Cup Foods on East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, Monday, June 1, 2020, in Minneapolis. Protests continued following the death of Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on May 25. (Source: AP Photo/John Minchillo) The most serious charge was filed against Derek Chauvin, who was caught on video pressing his knee to Floyd's neck and now must defend himself against an accusation of second-degree murder. The three other officers at the scene were charged for the first time with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. All four were fired last week. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to four decades in prison. Chauvin was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Those charges still stand. The new second-degree murder charge alleges that Chauvin caused Floyd's death without intent while committing another felony, namely third-degree assault. It carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison, compared with a maximum of 25 years for third-degree murder. The other officers — Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao — face the same maximum penalties for aiding and abetting. All three men were in custody by Wednesday evening. Chauvin was arrested last week and is still being held. The multiple charges against each officer would offer a jury more options to find them guilty. The charges were sought by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who called the protests unleashed by the death ""dramatic and necessary"" and said Floyd ""should be here and he is not."" ""His life had value, and we will seek justice,"" said Ellison, who cautioned that winning convictions would be hard and said that public pressure had no bearing on his decisions. Hundreds of protesters were in New York City's Washington Square Park when the charges were announced. ""It's not enough,"" protester Jonathan Roldan said, insisting all four officers should have been charged from the start. ""Right now, we're still marching because it's not enough that they got arrested. There needs to be systematic change."" Ben Crump, an attorney for Floyd's family, called it ""a bittersweet moment"" and ""a significant step forward on the road to justice."" Crump said Elison had told the family he would continue his investigation into Floyd's death and upgrade the charge to first-degree murder if warranted. The move by prosecutors punctuated an unprecedented week in modern American history, in which largely peaceful protests took place in communities of all sizes but were rocked by bouts of violence, including deadly attacks on officers, rampant thefts and arson in some places. Nationwide, more than 9,000 have been arrested in connection with unrest. At least 12 deaths have been reported, though the circumstances in many cases are still being sorted out. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, speaking after the new charges were announced, said the state and nation need to ""seize the moment"" and use the wrenching events of the past week to confront the effects of racism, including unequal educational and economic opportunities. ""I think this is probably our last shot, as a state and as a nation, to fix this systemic issue,"" he said at a news conference. Also Wednesday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office released the full autopsy report on Floyd, which noted he had previously tested positive for COVID-19, but was apparently asymptomatic. The report was released with the family's permission after summary findings Monday that said he had a heart attack while being restrained by officers. President Donald Trump has pushed the nation's governors to take a hard line against the violence. He again tweeted Wednesday: ""LAW & ORDER!"" An overpowering security force — including officers from the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, the Secret Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Prisons and, according to a senior defense official, at least 2,200 National Guard soldiers — was out in force Wednesday as thousands of peaceful protesters demonstrated in the nation's capital. Some remained near the White House while others marched toward the Capitol building. Military vehicles were parked on streets near the White House, and an array of agencies kept watch from the air. An FBI plane, an Army surveillance plane and a Park Police helicopter circled overhead. At one point near the White House, protesters began singing ""Amazing Grace"" as they knelt in view of law enforcement officers in riot gear. ""We are not going anywhere!"" they chanted. There were no signs of confrontations. Protester Jade Jones, 30, said the demonstrations would continue despite the new charges. ""That's the least they could do,"" said Jones, who had been attending Washington protests for days. ""It's not going to wipe away 400 years of pain."" ""We are glad there are additional charges, but that doesn't mean justice has been served,"" she said. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. In New York City, where high-end stores were looted in earlier days, some retailers fortified their property. At the luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue, windows were boarded up, then covered in chain-link fencing and razor wire. The front of the store was guarded by a line of tattooed men with dogs. There was scuffling in some parts of the city Wednesday night, but no signs of major clashes between protesters and police. The protests have also taken root overseas. In Greece, police fired tear gas after young people attacked them Wednesday outside the U.S. Embassy in Athens. Some 4,000 protesters had been peaceful until near the end of the demonstration, when some threw gasoline bombs and stones at police. No injuries or arrests were reported. Other protests were held Wednesday in London, Helsinki, Rotterdam and Bogota, among other cities. The anger over Floyd's death has spilled into an array of racial issues across the U.S. In Philadelphia, for example, a statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo was removed by the city Wednesday after repeatedly being targeted by vandals. Rizzo presided over a police force widely accused of racism and brutality in the 1970s. In Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam was expected to announce plans Thursday for the removal of an iconic statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Richmond's prominent Monument Avenue, a senior administration official told The Associated Press. The statue in the former Confederate capital has been the target of vandalism during the protests. ___ Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.

1624292222,2020-06-03 07:59:00,How Much Do We Need The Police?,https://www.kios.org/post/how-much-do-we-need-police,en,False,"politics and government, labor, blacks, police",306237,kios.org,http://kios.org/,"One effect of the widespread protests across U.S. cities this week has been to renew discussions of what role the police should play in society. For many Americans, it goes without saying that the police are critical in maintaining public safety. Have an emergency? Call the police. But many others — especially black people and poor people — have long countered that the police pose more of a threat to their safety than a boon. See a police officer? Walk the other direction. So it seems like a good moment to talk to Alex S. Vitale. He's the author of the 2017 book The End of Policing. In it, he argues that rather than focus on police reform or officer retraining, the country needs to fundamentally reconsider what it is the police should be doing at all. I spoke with Vitale about what roles police should and shouldn't play, what he makes of the current protests and what actual change in the way police in this country do their jobs might look like. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. One of the arguments you make in The End of Policing is that police are being asked to do too much. They're basically being tasked with addressing every social problem that we have. So what are police asked to do? And what should they be asked to do? One of the problems that we're encountering here is this massive expansion in the scope of policing over the last 40 years or so. Policing is now happening in our schools. It's happening in relation to the problems of homelessness, untreated mental illness, youth violence and some things that we historically associate police with. But the policing has become more intensive, more invasive, more aggressive. So what I'm calling for is a rethink on why we've turned all of these social problems over to the police to manage. And as we dial those things back, then we can think more concretely about what the rest of policing should look like and how that could be reformed. You brought up homelessness. In many cities police are tasked with dealing with people experiencing homelessness — but they don't have many options besides basically moving people or arresting them. Well, we've created this situation where our political leaders have basically abandoned the possibility of actually housing people. Which, of course, is the real solution, supportive housing for those who need extra support. But basically, we have a massive failure in housing markets that is unable to provide basic shelter for millions of Americans. So instead of actually addressing that fundamental problem, we have relabeled it as a problem that is the fault of the disorderly people who we label as morally deficient. And then we use police to criminalize them, to control their behavior and to reduce their disorderly impact on the rest of us. And this is perverse and unjust. So then it places police in this completely untenable situation, because they completely lack the tools to make this problem any better. And yet we've told them it's their problem to manage. ... Part of our misunderstanding about the nature of policing is we keep imagining that we can turn police into social workers. That we can make them nice, friendly community outreach workers. But police are violence workers. That's what distinguishes them from all other government functions, is that they have the legal capacity to use violence in situations where the average citizen would be arrested. So when we turn a problem over to the police to manage, there will be violence, because those are ultimately the tools that they are most equipped to utilize: handcuffs, threats, guns, arrests. That's what really is at the root of policing. So if we don't want violence, we should try to figure out how to not get the police involved. There are obviously a lot of people who agree broadly with the notion that the way that policing happens in this country is a problem and that there needs to be some sort of change. But they're pretty invested in the idea that police are needed to maintain public safety. People ask the question, without police, what do you do when someone gets murdered? What do you do when someone's house gets robbed? What do you say to those people who have those concerns? Well, I'm certainly not talking about any kind of scenario where tomorrow someone just flips a switch and there are no police. What I'm talking about is the systematic questioning of the specific roles that police currently undertake, and attempting to develop evidence-based alternatives so that we can dial back our reliance on them. And my feeling is that this encompasses actually the vast majority of what police do. We have better alternatives for them. Even if you take something like burglary — a huge amount of burglary activity is driven by drug use. And we need to completely rethink our approach to drugs so that property crime isn't the primary way that people access drugs. We don't have any part of this country that has high quality medical drug treatment on demand. But we have policing on demand everywhere. And it's not working. Obviously, a big part of what is on people's minds right now is the role that police have in dealing with protesters, dealing with different types of political unrest. In your book, you talk a lot about the history of how police have been used to quell social unrest. Can you talk about that history a little bit? Well, I think that one of the myths we have about policing is that it is politically neutral, and that it is always here to sort of create order in a way that benefits everyone. But the reality is that America's social order has never been entirely equitable. We have a long history of exploitation of the indigenous population, of African Americans through slavery, Jim Crow and today. And while we're not using police to manage slavery or colonialism today, we are using police to manage the problems that our very unequal system has produced. We're invested in this kind of austerity politics that says the government can't afford to really do anything to lift people up. We have to put all our resources into subsidizing the already most successful parts of the economy. But those parts of the economy are producing this huge group of people who are homeless, unemployed, have untreated mental health and substance abuse problems. And then we ask the police to put a lid on those problems — to manage them so they don't interfere with the ""order"" that we're supposedly all benefiting from. But if you're one of those poor people, one of those folks with a mental health problem, someone who's involved in black market activities to survive, then you experience this as constant criminalization. And would you say the same goes for people who are political protesters? Political protest has always been a part of this dynamic, right? Political protests are a threat to the order of this system. And so policing has always been the primary tool for managing those threats to the public order. Just as we understand the use of police to deal with homelessness as a political failure, every time we turn a political order problem over to the police to manage, that's also a political failure. I think the mayor of Minneapolis, for instance: Jacob Frey. He has consistently tried to frame this as a problem of a few bad apples. And he says, ""Why are you protesting? We fired them."" But this completely misunderstands the nature of the grievances. And instead of actually addressing those grievances, he's throwing police at the problem. Are the interactions that are happening right now between police and protesters something that you think is predictable? Or is this something new that we haven't seen before? It's not completely new, it's just the intensity of it compared to, let's say, five years ago during the Eric Garner and the Mike Brown protests. What we're seeing is really an immediate escalation to very high levels of force, a high degree of confrontation. And I think part of it is driven by deep frustration within policing, which is that police feel under assault, and they have no answer. They trotted out all the possible solutions: police-community dialogue sessions, implicit bias training, community policing, body cameras. And it just didn't work. It didn't make any difference. And so they ran out of excuses. So the protests today are a much more kind of existential threat to the police. And the police are overreacting as a result. If we were to take serious steps toward moving in the direction of having police address fewer of our social problems and putting those problems in the hands of people who are actually more equipped to deal with them, what would be the next step? What is the next thing that we as a country have to push for? I think this will look like a series of local budget battles. And that's really what's going on across the country, is when we have these divest campaigns in places like Los Angeles and Minneapolis and New York and Durham, North Carolina and Nashville, Tennessee and Dallas, Texas. These are folks who are saying concretely: ""We don't want police in our schools. We want that money spent in ways that help our children, not criminalize them. We don't want more money for overtime for narcotics officers. We want actual drug treatment programs, safe injection facilities, things that will help people."" So that's what this looks like. It's about rallying city council members and mayors around a new vision of creating healthier communities. When you're looking around at what's happening right now, what are the things that you think people need to understand to really process what is going on around the country? Well, I think the police are making the argument for us, right? People started this conversation by saying policing is out of control; they're not making the situation better. They have not been reformed. Well, now all you have to do is turn on the nightly news and see how true that is. The level of aggression and unnecessary escalation is stark evidence of how unreformed policing is, and I argue how unreformable it is. The question is whether or not people will take it to the next step and ask the tough political questions. Why are our mayors turning this over to the police to manage? Why are we using curfews instead of having conversations? Why are we throwing protesters in prison instead of trying to figure out what's driving all of this anger? ",0.0
