1617241932,2020-05-26 11:00:00,Hong Kong leader says security law not a threat to freedoms,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/05/26/breaking-news/hong-kong-leader-says-security-law-not-a-threat-to-freedoms/,en,False,,39573,HonululuAdvertiser,http://www.staradvertiser.com/,"HONG KONG >> Hong Kong’s leader said Tuesday that national security legislation proposed by China’s legislature will not threaten the semi-autonomous territory’s civil rights, despite widespread criticism of the move as an encroachment on freedom of speech and assembly. The city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, told reporters that there was “no need for us to worry” over the move being considered by China’s ceremonial National People’s Congress. “Hong Kong has proven that we uphold and preserve those values,” Lam said. “Hong Kong needs this piece of legislation for the bigger benefit of the great majority of Hong Kong people.” Lam also said that transit service would resume at Hong Kong’s international airport on June 1, but that foreigners would still be banned from entering the city as part of measures to prevent a new wave of coronavirus infections. The move by China to pass the legislation signals the central government’s determination to take greater control of Hong Kong after months of pro-democracy protests last year. Beijing has appointed new representatives in Hong Kong who follow the hard line laid down by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also the head of the ruling Communist Party. Such a move has long been under consideration and was hastened by last year’s street protests in the former British colony, which was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing promised that the territory could retain its own relatively liberal civil, legal and economic systems that contrast starkly with the much more centrally controlled and authoritarian system in mainland China. The U.S. has sharply criticized the proposed legislation and threatened to withdraw preferential trade status for Hong Kong. Some “foreign politicians” have “expressed untrue opinions” about the plan to impose the law on Hong Kong, Lam said, without giving details. She repeated claims that the law would only target “a minority,” citing concerns about terrorism and subversion. Protesters have returned to Hong Kong’s streets to oppose the legislation, with thousands turning out on Sunday as police fired tear gas and deployed a water cannon to disperse the crowds. On Tuesday, over 100 protesters gathered at a luxury shopping mall in Hong Kong’s Central business district, condemning Lam and her administration. The protests are a continuation of a monthslong pro-democracy movement that began last year and has at times descended into violence between police and demonstrators. Hong Kong’s government is bound by Article 23 of the Basic Law — its mini-constitution — to enact laws to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against China. It proposed legislation to do so in 2003, but withdrew it after hundreds of thousands of people came out to protest. Beijing has increasingly pushed for measures such as punishment for disrespecting the Chinese national flag or anthem — as often seen at soccer games — along with a boost to pro-China patriotic-themed education in schools. However, opposition in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council makes it unlikely a national security bill could pass at the local level, prompting Beijing to utilize what some describe as dubious legal grounds to force the measures through at the national level. The Chinese public is largely seen as backing Xi’s tough approach to foreign policy challenges, including criticism from the U.S., Australia and others. Xi has made an unswerving line on national interests a key signature of his rule since taking over leadership of the ruling party in 2012. Abroad, however, that policy has further bolstered concerns about China’s intentions to dominate markets and assert its influence in the Asia-Pacific region. That may ultimately add to Xi’s difficulties in reviving economic growth and jobs at a time when global markets are partly shut due to the coronavirus pandemic and skepticism toward China runs high.",0.0
1617488621,2020-05-26 20:59:00,"Muslims celebrate major holiday amid curfews, virus fears",https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/05/26/news/muslims-celebrate-major-holiday-amid-curfews-virus-fears/,en,False,,39573,HonululuAdvertiser,http://www.staradvertiser.com/,"JERUSALEM >> Muslims around the world on Sunday began celebrating Eid al-Fitr, a normally festive holiday marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, with millions under strict stay-at-home orders and many fearing renewed coronavirus outbreaks. The three-day holiday is usually a time of travel, family get-togethers and lavish daytime feasts after weeks of dawn-to-dusk fasting. But this year many of the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims will have to pray at home and make due with video calls. Some countries, including Turkey, Iraq and Jordan, have imposed round-the-clock holiday curfews. But even where many restrictions have been lifted, celebrations will be subdued because of fears of the pandemic and its economic fallout. Saudi Arabia, home to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, is under a complete lockdown, with residents only permitted to leave their homes to purchase food and medicine. In Jerusalem, Israeli police said they broke up an “illegal demonstration” and arrested two people outside the Al-Aqsa mosque, which Muslim authorities have closed for prayers since mid-March and will not reopen until after the holiday. Worshippers who tried to enter the compound scuffled with the police. Al-Aqsa is the third holiest site in Islam and would ordinarily welcome tens of thousands of worshippers during the Eid. The hilltop compound is also the holiest site for Jews, who know it as the Temple Mount. The site has long been a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Iran, which is battling the deadliest outbreak in the Middle East, allowed communal prayers at some mosques but cancelled the annual mass Eid prayers in Tehran led by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran has reported over 130,000 cases and more than 7,000 deaths. The virus causes mild to moderate flu-like symptoms in most patients, who recover within two to three weeks. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness or death, particularly in older patients or those with underlying health conditions. Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, has reported nearly 22,000 infections and 1,350 fatalities, the most in Southeast Asia. Lockdown orders intended to contain the pandemic mean there will be no congregational prayers at mosques or even open fields, no family reunions, no relatives bearing gifts for children. “This outbreak is not just dampening spirits of Eid, but also has made the tradition entirely different,” said Andieka Rabbani, a university student in Jakarta. This year, like many Indonesians, he will only see family and friends through video calls. In neighboring Muslim-majority Malaysia, businesses have mostly reopened after weeks of lockdown. But mass gatherings are still banned and people are not allowed to travel back to their hometowns for the holiday. Police have turned away more than 5,000 cars and have warned of strict penalties for those who try to sneak home. Malaysians are only allowed to visit relatives who live nearby, and only on Sunday, with gatherings limited to 20 people. Mosques have reopened but are limited to small congregations of up to 30. Malaysia has reported 7,185 infections and 115 deaths. Rohaizam Zainuddin said he felt blessed he could celebrate Eid with his elderly parents living nearby, but his sister in another state could not return home. “We are frustrated that celebration this year is not the same,” he said. “But there is no point getting angry. We just have to accept it, life goes on.” He and his family members are still wearing new clothes and preparing traditional dishes. Plates of cookies are set out for any visitors, alongside a thermometer and hand sanitizer. In Pakistan, Eid is being celebrated in the shadow of the coronavirus and in the wake of a passenger plane crash near Karachi on Friday that killed 97 people. For the first time, Pakistan is celebrating Eid countrywide on the same day, ending an annual controversy between rival committees over the moon sighting that signals the start of the holiday. Pakistan has taken measures to control the spread of the coronavirus since mid-March, but Prime Minister Imran Khan refused to close mosques during Ramadan despite pleas from doctors and a rising number of infections. Pakistan has reported more than 52,000 cases and more than 1,100 deaths. More than 1,000 worshippers gathered and prayed shoulder-to-shoulder in an open field in Karachi on Sunday, with only a few of them wearing masks. In neighboring Afghanistan, the government and Taliban insurgents announced a three-day cease-fire in honor of the holiday. Some 2,000 Muslims gathered for Eid al-Fitr prayers Sunday at a sports complex in the Paris suburb of Levallois-Perret, carefully spaced apart and wearing masks, according to France-Info radio. Traditional embraces were not allowed. France is allowing religious services to resume for the first time since March, but France’s leading Muslim organization, CFCM, advised mosques to stay closed Sunday. The CFCM said the government decree didn’t give mosques enough time to procure masks and hand gel to ensure that gatherings don’t turn into super-spreading events. In Sudan, which has reported more than 3,600 cases and 146 deaths, thousands of people gathered for prayers in mosques and open areas, defying a curfew and other restrictions imposed by authorities, local media reported. Virus restrictions remain in place in the mostly-Muslim Balkan countries of Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. Mosques have reopened in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, but worshippers must wear masks and practice social distancing, and older individuals were urged to continue praying at home. Naim Ternava, the mufti of Kosovo’s Islamic community, led prayers in a mosque in front of a small group of imams sitting 1.5 meters (yards) apart, with the sermon broadcast outside on loudspeakers. “I invite you to be patient a little bit more until we overcome the danger,” he said.",0.0

1618248182,2020-05-27 13:35:00,George Floyd's Death Stokes Call For Minneapolis Officers To Be Charged With Murder,https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/george-floyds-death-stokes-call-minneapolis-officers-be-charged-murder,en,False,,332152,hawaiipublicradio.org,http://hawaiipublicradio.org/,"Updated at 2:20 p.m. ET Just one day after the death of a black man whose arrest was recorded and posted on social media by a passerby, Minneapolis is grappling with the fallout that has spread beyond city limits. The disturbing video of Monday night's death — during which a white officer's knee was planted firmly on George Floyd's neck and his desperate calls for help were ignored — has prompted protests in the Minnesota city and demands for charges for the officers involved. At a news conference Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to ""act on the evidence before him"" and press charges on the arresting officer. ""Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail? If you had done it or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now. And I cannot come up with a good answer to that question,"" Frey told a news conference Wednesday. ""We watched for five whole excruciating minutes as a white officer firmly pressed his knee into the neck of an unarmed, handcuffed black man,"" he added, noting that the arresting officer was not practicing a technique condoned by the city's police. ""I saw no threat; I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary."" Frey refrained from specifying what charges he would like to see, citing a desire not to impede investigators. But Floyd's sister Bridgett went one step further on national television earlier Wednesday. ""I would like for those officers to be charged with murder because that's exactly what they did,"" she told the Today show. ""They murdered my brother; he was crying for help."" She said the family, which has retained legal representation, is far from satisfied with the announcement that the four officers in the video have been fired — a swift decision that Frey said was ""the right call."" The Minneapolis Police Department has not publicly confirmed the officers' identities, and it said the FBI is also investigating the circumstances of Floyd's death. The announcement also failed to satisfy protesters who on Tuesday evening thronged to the department's 3rd Precinct, where clashes erupted between demonstrators and law enforcement in riot gear. As Minnesota Public Radio reported, the demonstrators damaged the building and a squad car in a confrontation that eventually saw police firing tear gas into the crowd. ""What we witnessed today was state-sponsored murder, a state-sponsored execution,"" Steven Belton, president of the nonprofit Urban League Twin Cities, said at a gathering of local civil rights leaders earlier Tuesday outside City Hall. ""And what we await to see is whether it's going to become state-sanctioned execution. It'll be sanctioned if nothing is done."" The controversy engulfing Minneapolis is not unfolding in a vacuum. Already a video recorded earlier this year in Georgia — depicting the death of an unarmed black man, who was followed and shot by two white men while out for a jog three months ago — has renewed questions about the conduct of local police, who did not arrest the men until after the video surfaced this month. And this week, a recorded encounter in New York City's Central Park caught fire after it was posted to social media. In the video, a white woman calls the police on a black man, who says he had simply asked her to leash her dog while he was out bird-watching. ""He's recording me and threatening me and my dog,"" she tells emergency operators multiple times as the man recording her keeps his distance. After the video surfaced, the woman was fired by her employer, the investment firm Franklin Templeton. The video recorded in Minneapolis more closely called to mind an earlier death in New York City, however. Like Eric Garner, who died after an officer's chokehold in 2014, Floyd's final words before he appeared to lose consciousness were a plea for help: ""I can't breathe."" Floyd is seen wailing the phrase several times with his face planted on the pavement, his hands apparently cuffed behind his back and a male officer kneeling on his neck. Observers standing nearby are heard telling officers that Floyd's nose was bleeding and that he was dying. The officer and his colleagues show little reaction as the man gradually goes silent. The officer does not lift his weight off Floyd's neck throughout most of the video until medical workers arrive to lift him into an ambulance on a stretcher. The New York City police officer who used the chokehold on Garner, Daniel Pantaleo, was never charged with a crime but was fired last year on a judge's recommendation. The Floyd family's attorney emphasized the link with Garner in comments Wednesday to the Today show. ""It's worse than Eric Garner in many ways,"" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said, ""because you hear the people even pleading with them, 'Please get your knee off his neck. Have some humanity; this is a human being,' "" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a statement Tuesday, ""There must be a complete and thorough outside investigation into what occurred, and those involved in this incident must be held accountable. Justice must be served for this man and his family, justice must be served for our community, and justice must be served for our country."" ",0.0

""After careful study of developments over the reporting period, I certified to Congress today that Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under United States laws in the same manner as U.S. laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997,"" Pompeo said in a statement released Wednesday. ""No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground."" The secretary announced his decision at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China. President Trump has blamed Chinese authorities for failing to prevent the coronavirus from becoming a global pandemic, noting that his administration is ""not going to take it lightly."" And earlier this month the Senate trained its legislative fire on China, with a unanimously passed bill that could force some foreign companies off U.S. stock exchanges. The State Department also has pushed back hard against China's recent plans for an aggressive new security law that would criminalize behavior in Hong Kong seen as critical of Beijing. In a statement shortly after news of the proposed legislation surfaced, Pompeo called it ""a death knell for the high degree of autonomy."" For more than two decades, the semiautonomous region has been governed under a principle Beijing calls ""one country, two systems,"" which allows Hong Kong certain freedoms from the communist economic and legal systems practiced on mainland China. Partly for that reason, the U.S. treats Hong Kong as separate from the rest of China as long as the city remains sufficiently autonomous. But the relationship between Beijing and Hong Kong's residents has grown increasingly fraught in recent years, with the city periodically erupting into massive demonstration against what protesters and the U.S. call Beijing's attempts to encroach on its freedoms. The region again saw clashes between protesters and riot police last weekend. One of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, Joshua Wong, urged leaders abroad to reconsider whether its ""special trade status can still be held since, once the law is implemented, Hong Kong will be assimilated into China's authoritarian regime, on both rule of law and human rights protections."" Now, that status appears in jeopardy with the Trump administration's reappraisal. ""Hong Kong and its dynamic, enterprising and free people have flourished for decades as a bastion of liberty, and this decision gives me no pleasure,"" Pompeo said Wednesday. ""But sound policymaking requires a recognition of reality. While the United States once hoped that free and prosperous Hong Kong would provide a model for authoritarian China, it is now clear that China is modeling Hong Kong after itself.""

Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving. “I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white. He later added: “I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.” The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired — an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store. Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. A smaller protest was underway this afternoon outside the same precinct. Roughly a dozen officers stood behind barriers while a couple of hundred protesters occasionally yelled at them and threw objects. Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin’s suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door. Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd’s family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete. Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests. “We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department’s culture. “One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said. The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota’s two top law enforcement officials — Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black — promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn’t endorse the mayor’s call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out. “I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it’s important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,” Ellison said. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd’s death had “outraged us and people across the country” and that the case “deserves the best we can give.” The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. Floyd’s death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others. Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Fla., President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis “a very, very sad event” and said his administration was going to “look at it.” Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited. Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd’s death was “part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country” and “cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.” It also “sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,” Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, “but I don’t think that’s enough.” A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally. Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told the AP. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store. It was unclear why Floyd was arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks. A Minneapolis Fire Department report shows that paramedics moved Floyd from the scene, and two fire crew members got into the ambulance to help. Medics were doing chest compressions and other lifesaving measures on an “unresponsive, pulseless male,” the report said. Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital. An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to his death. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. In calling for charges, the mayor contrasted Floyd’s death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers. “We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,” Frey said. “There’s somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes — every one of which that officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd’s neck.”",0.0

Police massed outside the legislative building ahead of the session and warned protesters that if they did not disperse, they could be prosecuted. In the Central business district, police raised flags warning protesters to disperse before they shot pepper balls at the crowd and searched several people. More than 50 people in the Causeway Bay shopping district were rounded up and made to sit outside a shopping mall, while riot police with pepper spray patrolled and warned journalists to stop filming.

Those guilty of the offense would face up to three years in prison and a fine of 50,000 Hong Kong dollars ($6,450). Opponents of the bill say it is a blow to freedom of expression in the city, while Beijing officials say it will foster a patriotic spirit and socialist values. “Western democracies all have laws to protect their national flags, national anthems and emblems. Any insulting acts toward these symbols would also be criminal,” pro-Beijing lawmaker Tony Tse said in the legislative debate. Tse said the bill would not affect human rights or force people to love the country or support any political power. “The purpose of this is to protect the dignity of a country,” he said. Pro-democracy lawmaker Charles Mok disagreed, saying the legislation would not help gain the respect of people and was an excuse to control freedom, speech and ideas of people. “We oppose the second reading of the national anthem bill, not because we don’t respect the national anthem. The national anthem is a symbol of the country’s dignity. If it wants to be respected, then let this government first respect the rights and freedoms of its people first,” Mok said. The debate over the anthem bill is expected to continue on Thursday. The bill was proposed in January 2019 after spectators from Hong Kong jeered at the anthem during high-profile international soccer matches in 2015. Last year, FIFA fined the Hong Kong Football Association after fans booed the national anthem at a World Cup qualifying game. Hong Kong was returned to China from British colonial rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” framework that promised freedoms not found on the mainland. Anti-China sentiment has risen as residents see Beijing moving to erode those rights. Mass protests in 2014, known as the Umbrella Revolution, followed the Chinese government’s decision to allow direct election of the city leader only after it screened candidates. In the end, the plan for direct elections was dropped. Legislation proposed in Hong Kong last year that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China for trials set off months of demonstrations that at times involved clashes between protesters and police. The legislation was withdrawn. China’s ceremonial parliament now meeting in Beijing has moved to enact a national security law for Hong Kong aimed at forbidding secessionist and subversive activity, as well as foreign interference and terrorism. Hong Kong’s own government has been unable to pass such legislation due to opposition in the city, and Beijing advanced the law itself after the protests last year. Asked about possible U.S. retaliation over the security legislation, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in Beijing that China would take necessary steps to fight back against what he called “erroneous foreign interference in Hong Kong’s affairs.”",0.0

We’re a nation that’s divided. ADVERTISING Four years after Kaepernick took a knee during the playing of the national anthem, he’s been blackballed from the NFL for three years. And nothing seems to have changed in society, in light of Ahmaud Arbery’s death at the hands of vigilantes who hunted him down and shot the 25-year-old black male as he jogged in their Brunswick, Ga., neighborhood, and the recent killing of George Floyd, a Minnesota man whose pleas were ignored as a police officer kept his knee on Floyd’s neck. “Please, I can’t breathe,” Floyd was caught on a bystander’s video as saying while handcuffed and pinned down by officers on the scene. One of those officers had his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. “Everything hurts,” Floyd said. “They’re going to kill me.” And that’s exactly what these four officers on the scene, who were supposed to protect and serve society, did to this 46-year-old African American male. All four were fired on Tuesday, but charges haven’t been filed, and arrests haven’t been made. History tells us getting justice for Floyd will be just as much of an uphill battle as it is to get justice for Arbrey, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and Eric Garner, all unarmed people of color whose deaths have inspired Kaepernick’s protest and the Black Lives Matter movement. And the truth is, without video evidence of exactly what happened, the world would never know the truth, and most of society probably wouldn’t care. Floyd would be dead, and those former officers would still have a job policing society, pretending to create law and order because of their creative writing skills on an incident report. Without video evidence, we could continue to believe that Floyd was just another threat to society. Or to put it in simpler terms, he was just another black man like my father, my brother and my son. Think about how many times during the course of a month, the year, this decade — or better yet your lifetime — incidents like this have happened in your community to people of color and it wasn’t caught on video. How many times has someone been victimized by police brutality or overall bigotry that didn’t create an outrage? This isn’t OK. But more importantly, it has never been OK. Yet it keeps happening. Ask yourself why, and then ask yourself what are you going to do about it? What are you going to do about yet another black man who was murdered at the hands of the police officer employed to protect and serve? That unnamed officer knelt on Floyd’s neck with conviction for several — not a couple — minutes as Floyd pleaded for his life. You have to wonder if Arbery pleaded for his life too, as armed men in two vehicles chased him up and down that Georgia neighborhood before finally catching him and shooting him in a February confrontation that was caught on video. It took three months for the men involved in that fatal encounter to be arrested, and that likely only happened because a video started circulating on social media, bringing his death to a national platform. Not everyone feels our pain and anguish, and Kaepernick certainly taught us there is a price to speaking up about what is going on in America regarding social injustice and police brutality. Kaepernick sacrificed his playing career because he wouldn’t back off his movement, he wouldn’t stop kneeling, and the NFL made him an example for those who wanted to follow. There’s a community of people suffering from what Kaepernick and other NFL players, many of whom where Dolphins players, have been trying to create awareness for. The problem is many choose to ignore our plea like that officer ignored George Floyd. Are you listening because these incidents, the deaths Arbery and Floyd, resonate in troubling and familiar ways? ADVERTISING How many more must die before America realizes people of color are treated beneath the protection of the law, and that our lives matter too? What is happening is a recurring problem, and it will continue unless we confront it, properly examine the problem and the issues, and actually take a stand for the exact reason Kaepernick knelt.",0.0

The mayor asked the governor to activate the National Guard. The protests that began late Wednesday and stretched into this morning were the most destructive yet since the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video gasping for breath during an arrest in which an officer kneeled on his neck for almost eight minutes. In the footage, George pleads that he cannot breathe and slowly stops talking and moving. Mayor Jacob Frey sought calm. “Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy,” he said on Twitter. Protests also spread to other U.S. cities. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd’s death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Memphis police blocked a main thoroughfare after a racially mixed group of protesters gathered outside a police precinct. The situation intensified later in the night, with police donning riot gear and protesters standing shoulder-to-shoulder in front of officers stationed behind a barricade. Minneapolis police said the violence contrasted sharply with a peaceful demonstration Tuesday afternoon at the street corner where Floyd died. “They were chanting for things to remain peaceful,” police spokesman John Elder said. “Tonight didn’t have the same feel. And that’s sad.” Pockets of looting continued today at Minneapolis stores where windows and doors were smashed. Television station KSTP reported that some fires at businesses burned with no firefighters on the scene. A liquor store employee displayed a gun as he stood among the debris of broken bottles and beer cans inside the business. Amid the violence, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes during the protests, including at least 16 structure fires, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. Protesters began gathering Wednesday afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city, where the 46-year-old Floyd died on Memorial Day as police arrested him outside a convenience store on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. Protesters also skirmished with officers, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas in a repeat of Tuesday night’s confrontation. By this morning, smoke hung over the city, and looters carried merchandise from a damaged Target store with no interference by police. Video of the store’s interior showed empty clothing racks and shelves and debris strewn about. Obscenities were spray-painted on the outside of the store. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said today they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into Floyd’s death and making the case a priority. The announcement came a day after President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI had already announced that it would investigate whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. The officer who kneeled on Floyd and three others were fired Tuesday. On Wednesday, the mayor called for him to be criminally charged. Frey appealed to Gov. Tim Walz to activate the National Guard, a spokesman confirmed today. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Walz tweeted for calm Wednesday night, calling the violence “an extremely dangerous situation” and urging people to leave the scene. Officers responding to a reported stabbing near the protests found a man lying on the sidewalk Wednesday night with a bullet wound, police spokesman John Elder said. The man was pronounced dead at a hospital. Elder said a suspect was in custody and that the facts leading up to the shooting were “still being sorted out.”",0.0

Police said they were investigating the death as a homicide and had a suspect in custody, but were still investigating what led to the shooting. ADVERTISING Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old George Floyd died on Memorial Day after an officer knelt on his neck until he became unresponsive. News helicopter footage showed protesters milling in streets near the city’s 3rd Precinct station, with some running in and out of nearby stores. A Target, a Cub Foods, a Dollar Tree and an auto parts store all showed signs of damage and looting. As darkness fell, fire erupted in the auto parts store, and city fire crews rushed to control it. Protesters set other fires in the street. Officers could be seen surrounding the nearby precinct, not attempting to intervene in the looting. Police spokesman John Elder said officers responding to a reported stabbing near the protests found a man lying on the sidewalk with what turned out to be a bullet wound. The man was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Elder said a suspect was in custody but said the facts leading up to the shooting were “still being sorted out.” It was the second night of violent protest since the death of Floyd, whom police were seeking to arrest outside a Minneapolis grocery store on a report of a counterfeit bill being passed. A bystander’s cellphone video showed an officer kneeling on Floyd ‘s neck for almost eight minutes as he eventually became unresponsive. The officer and three others were fired Tuesday, and on Wednesday, Mayor Jacob Frey called for him to be criminally charged. Protesters also gathered Wednesday evening at the officer’s suburban home as well as the Minneapolis home of Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County prosecutor who would make a charging decision in the case. No violence was reported in those protests. As the protests stretched into the evening, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged calm. In an interview with KMSP-TV, he noted the internal investigation as well as the FBI’s investigation of Floyd’s death and said they offer a chance at justice. “Justice historically has never come to fruition through some of the acts we’re seeing tonight, whether it’s the looting, the damage to property or other things,” he said. ADVERTISING Elder said officers from St. Paul, Metro Transit and the state patrol were helping police the area.

Tim Walz called in the National Guard on Thursday as looting broke out in St. Paul and a wounded Minneapolis braced for more violence after rioting over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man in police custody, reduced parts of one neighborhood to a smoking shambles. The Minneapolis unrest ravaged several blocks in the Longfellow neighborhood, with scattered rioting reaching for miles across the city. It was the second consecutive night of violent protests following Floyd's death Monday. In footage recorded by a bystander, Floyd can be seen pleading that he can't breath as an officer kneels on his neck. As minutes pass, he slowly stops talking and moving. Businesses across the Twin Cities were boarding up their windows and doors Thursday in an effort to prevent looting. The city shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. Around midday Thursday, the violence spread a few miles away to St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, where police said 50 to 60 people rushed a Target attempting to loot it. Police and state patrol squad cars later blocked the entrance, but the looting shifted to shops along nearby University Avenue, one of St. Paul's main commercial corridors, and other spots in the city. By early evening, the windows of more than a dozen stores were smashed, and firefighters were putting out a handful of small blazes. St. Paul spokesman Steve Linders said authorities were dealing with unrest in roughly 20 different areas. ""Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,"" tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among several hundred people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers called for peaceful protest. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at ""every single protest"" since Floyd's death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. ""We don't want to be here fighting against anyone. We don't want anyone to be hurt. We don't want to cause any damages,"" she said. ""We just want the police officer to be held accountable."" Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchinson said the rally had been peaceful and there had been no arrests by late evening. The governor's order did not say how many Guard members were mobilized or whether they would be in service Thursday night. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd's death. ""It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect,"" Walz said. Thursday morning in Minneapolis, smoke rose from smoldering buildings in the Longfellow neighborhood. In a strip mall across the street from the police's 3rd Precinct station, the focus of the protests on both nights, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. ""WHY US?"" demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy's restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. ""We're burning our own neighborhood,"" said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. ""This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it."" No officers could be seen beyond the station. ""What that cop did was wrong, but I'm scared now,"" Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property ""because the system is broken,"" said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. ""They're making money off of us,"" he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. ""I didn't break anything."" The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday's, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city's response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. ""If the strategy was to keep residents safe — it failed,"" City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. ""Prevent property damage — it failed."" On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. But Eric Kowalczyk, a police captain in Baltimore during the Freddie Gray riots in 2015, generally supported the Minneapolis police strategy to avoid confrontations with protesters when possible, saying heavy-handed police responses are only met with more violence. ""Nobody wants to see their city on fire, but at the same time, you don't want to see citizens injured by the very police department they are protesting,"" he said. Protests also spread to other U.S. cities. In California, hundreds of people protesting Floyd's death blocked a Los Angeles freeway and shattered windows of California Highway Patrol cruisers. Memphis police blocked a main thoroughfare after a racially mixed group of protesters gathered outside a police station.

Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as ""awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself."" Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was ""under the influence of something,"" the caller said: ""Something like that, yes. He is not acting right."" Police said Floyd matched the caller's description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting ""a robust criminal investigation"" into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd's civil rights were violated.

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. >> PHOTO GALLERY: Minneapolis protests continue over the death of George Floyd Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night at City Hall near 2 a.m. Friday and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers there. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that … What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said Guard members were being stationed in locations to help stem looting, including banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request, but it wasn’t immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was “here with the Minneapolis Fire Department” to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called for a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between officers and protesters but no widespread property damage. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes on Wednesday, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard.",0.0

The order by Gov. Tim Walz came as the city asked for help after vandalism and fires erupted during demonstrations and as the Justice Department announced that a federal investigation into Floyd’s death was a top priority. At a news conference this evening, U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald pledged a “robust and meticulous investigation” into the death but stopped short of announcing criminal charges against the four officers who were at the scene, all of whom were fired after Floyd’s death was captured in a haunting videotape. “My heart goes out to George Floyd,” said MacDonald, a former judge. “My heart goes out to his family. My heart goes out to his friends. My heart goes out to the community.” South Minneapolis continued to seethe at the treatment of Floyd — and demonstrators railed against what they described as a city in which black lives are valued less than those of white residents. “I want justice. I hope the continued pressure will get us charges, but we have to have some patience,” said Jamar Nelson, a community activist who works with families of crime victims. “The worst outcome is if we rush and the charges don’t stick.” In one section of Minneapolis tonight, hundreds of people held a vigil near where Floyd died, leaving new flowers and balloons not far from a mural of him, newly painted along a building’s wall. In other parts of the city and in St. Paul, police in riot gear clashed with protesters amid reports of vandalized buildings and fires in businesses and in a car. In Minneapolis, at least one person was injured in a stabbing during the chaos, the police said, though details were sparse. Minneapolis’ deep racial divide is as much a feature of the city for its black residents as its picturesque parks, robust employment and thriving businesses. African Americans earn one-third as much as white residents. They graduate from high school at much lower rates, are much likelier to be unemployed and tend to live in households with significantly less wealth than their white counterparts. One university professor calls it the “Minnesota paradox” — a pleasant place belied by gaping racial inequalities. Those disparities, the result of generations of discriminatory government policies, are now helping to fuel an uprising in the wake of Floyd’s death. The demonstrations, which continued today, spread to other parts of the metropolitan area, and the state Capitol was evacuated as a precaution. The case stirred protest in other parts of the country. Demonstrators turned out in Los Angeles on Wednesday night and in New York’s Union Square today. The protests in New York later moved to City Hall, where some demonstrators skirmished with the police. More than 30 people were arrested in those protests. “George Floyd’s death represents every fight, every battle for black progress in this city,” said Mike Griffin, a longtime community organizer in Minneapolis. “We want justice for George Floyd,” he continued, “but this is also about black dignity. We have had to fight tooth and nail for even the most basic standards of living. If you are white, this is a great city. If you are black, it is a struggle every day.” Even as public officials urged calm today after a chaotic evening in which someone was fatally shot near the protests in Minneapolis, police officials from around the country condemned the police actions that led to Floyd’s death. It was a rare and remarkable public denunciation by law enforcement of their own. Although Minneapolis is politically progressive and many white residents speak of racial justice, black residents say it has not been enough to solve the inequities. In fact, there is often resistance. For several years, advocates for workers pushed the city to adopt a $15 minimum wage, which the City Council did in 2017, but only after overcoming vigorous opposition from local businesses. “A lot of white people say they are not racist because they have black friends,” said Cynthia Montana, “but they go back to their white neighborhoods with their white friends. That’s why they don’t understand and they’re surprised when this happens.” Montana, 57, rode her bicycle today near a Target store that had been vandalized and looted during the previous night’s unrest and reflected on the challenges of growing up as a black person in Minneapolis. It begins in school, she said, where white children who get in trouble are excused as having a bad day, while black students are deemed to have disorders that need correcting. “It’s like layer and layer and layer of gunpowder building over a long time,” she said. “And when you become an adult, it’s this stick of dynamite.”",0.0

1619755907,2020-05-29 03:00:00,Trump calls George Floyd protesters ‘thugs’ and vows military support,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/05/28/breaking-news/trump-calls-george-floyd-protesters-thugs-and-vows-military-support/,en,False,,39573,HonululuAdvertiser,http://www.staradvertiser.com/,"WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump today called protesters in Minneapolis “thugs” and vowed that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump tweeted after protesters outraged by the death of a black man in police custody torched a police station. Earlier Thursday, Trump said, “I feel very, very badly” about George Floyd’s death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. “That’s a very shocking sight.” It was the kind of personal statement expected from a president in response to the disturbing video of a black man gasping for help as a white policeman pinned him to the street by the neck. But it was a very different tone for Trump, who has often been silent in the face of white-on-black violence and has a long history of defending police. Trump’s language got more aggressive as violence boiled over in Minneapolis Thursday night. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” he tweeted. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” Once more likely to hew to the “blue lives matter” mantra, Trump and his allies have been questioning an officer’s conduct and calling for justice for Floyd. But some activists doubt that Trump has suddenly evolved on the issue of police brutality and instead see election-year political calculations. “This is the first race-tinged case that I’ve ever heard him address” as president, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and Trump critic who has known the president for decades. “So therefore he cannot be upset when people feel that it’s empty words because it is so out of character.” Trump has been silent on a number of high-profile police-involved killings, including that of Stephon Clark, a black man shot by Sacramento police in 2018. “This is something that is a local matter and that’s something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities,” then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time. He has never addressed the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold by police trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes. Video of the encounter was viewed millions of times online and Garner’s dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has, however, invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect. Trump has a long history of injecting himself into racially sensitive cases. In 1989, he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of a brutal assault on a jogger. Trump has never apologized, telling reporters last year: “You have people on both sides of that.” Trump also spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And he has even appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars. But Trump’s tone has changed in recent weeks as he has repeatedly expressed dismay at footage of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man fatally shot in February in Georgia while jogging. “You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends,” he told reporters this month. “It’s a heartbreaking thing.” The president has notably left open the possibility of some other explanation, saying: “it could be something that we didn’t see on tape.” Trump and his allies have been even clearer on the death of Floyd, who can be heard and seen on tape pleading that he couldn’t breathe before he slowly stops talking and moving. Trump “was very upset when he saw that video,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. “He wants justice to be served.” Trump’s conservative allies also rallied to the cause. Fox News host Sean Hannity said he is “a big supporter of law enforcement,” but expressed outrage Wednesday night, telling his audience: “The lack of training here is breathtaking.” “It defies common sense. It defies training. It defies arrest policies and procedures. There was no resistance,” echoed Bernie Kerik, the former New York police commissioner pardoned by Trump. “We got to get to the very bottom of how this poor individual was treated, and the death of him on the video itself is shocking from what I saw,” said Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Even conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who once called Black Lives Matter a “terrorist group,” said Thursday that Floyd’s death was totally “unjustified” and he was “so mad.” The outpouring comes as the Trump campaign has sought to chip into the advantage Democrats have with black voters. The campaign hopes either to win enough black support to keep pivotal states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in play or minimize enthusiasm for Democratic rival Joe Biden. There could be a small window after Biden last week told a prominent black radio host that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black,” a gaffe he later said he regretted. Trump and his allies have seized on that and other Biden statements, even though Biden, who served as vice president under the nation’s first black president, remains deeply popular among black voters, who helped him secure the Democratic nomination. Indeed, a recent Fox News poll found that just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, versus 75% who have a favorable view of Biden. Chris White, the longtime director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, questioned the sincerity of Republicans’ response to the deaths of Arbery and Floyd. The White House and Department of Justice have long had the power to address these issues. “Any time we hear politicians speaking about dealing with police brutality in the middle of election year, it’s just meaningless rhetoric that has a hollow promise,” he said. Sharpton credited both the magnitude of outrage in response to Floyd’s death as well as the upcoming election for the changed approach. But he doubted many black voters will be swayed with an approach they may see as too little, too late. “It’s like a father that misses a kid’s graduation of high school, graduation of college,” he said. “He can’t be upset when the kid looks at him suspiciously when he’s there when he graduates with his Ph.D.”",0.0

1620109622,2020-05-29 06:13:00,Cliven Bundy Armed Standoff Case Going Back To Court,https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/cliven-bundy-armed-standoff-case-going-back-court,en,False,,332152,hawaiipublicradio.org,http://hawaiipublicradio.org/,"It's been more than two years since Cliven Bundy left the federal courthouse in downtown Las Vegas a free man. His arm around his wife, Carol Bundy, the Nevada rancher was defiant. ""We're not done with this,"" Bundy told reporters in January 2018. ""If the federal government comes after us again we will definitely tell 'em the truth."" On Friday, the Justice Department will try to come after the Bundys again, when federal prosecutors will appeal for a retrial over a 2014 armed standoff between Bundy, his militia and federal agents who had come to round up the rancher's cows that were illegally grazing on federal land. The government's case against Cliven Bundy, his sons, Ammon and Ryan and a Montana militiaman named Ryan Payne, collapsed after a judge declared a mistrial in December 2017. Bundy and his men were accused of conspiracy against federal agents and other charges for their role in the tense standoff which later became a symbol over the fight against federal control of public lands. ""If there is no successful prosecution, it's going to encourage a lot of anarchists like the Bundys to take actions that not only are a threat to themselves but threats to the public at large,"" said Pat Shea, who served as BLM director during the Clinton administration. Retrial effort criticized For their part, the Bundys and their supporters appear puzzled that the federal government is even pursuing a retrial. ""What's really ironic and frankly I think disgusting is that the Trump Justice Department is the one that allowed the U.S. attorney in Nevada to take the appeal,"" said Larry Klayman, Cliven Bundy's attorney. After all, President Trump recently pardoned two Oregon ranchers whose fight with federal land managers inspired Cliven Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, to lead a separate, armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016. Federal prosecutors mostly failed to get convictions in that Oregon case and have been widely criticized for bungling the Nevada trial. Judge Gloria Navarro dismissed the case and later declared a mistrial after ruling federal prosecutors ""deliberately misled"" defense attorneys and the court by failing to provide evidence from surveillance cameras and to disclose the existence of federal snipers near the ranch in the days leading up to the April 2014 standoff. The U.S. attorney's office in Nevada declined an interview request by NPR. But court filings indicate prosecutors will likely argue Friday that their missteps in the 2017 trial were ""inadvertent,"" and in particular they say they were trying to balance disclosing Bureau of Land Management surveillance footage with protecting witnesses against violence. Klayman, who is himself a controversial conservative activist and was once fixture in the ""Birther"" movement, says the DOJ is being hypocritical. He says the investigation against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was recently dropped, but not his clients. ""If you're one of the Washington elite and establishment in the nation's capital, you get special treatment,"" Klayman said. ""If you're Cliven Bundy and his sons and the peaceful protesters, basically you don't."" Most of the federal agents and land managers who were at the 2014 standoff say it was anything but a peaceful protest. Photos and social media posts showed militia training their rifles on armed BLM officers who had come to round up Bundy's cattle. Cliven Bundy has refused to recognize the federal government's ownership of millions of acres of public land — including in Nevada. The rancher has consequently not paid federal fees owed for grazing his cows on land near the Lake Mead National Recreation Area since the 1990s. Pandemic ""resuscitates"" movement Retired federal land managers like Pat Shea have expressed outrage over the government's continued failure to prosecute the Bundys, whose cows continue to graze — for free — on land that's now protected as a national monument. The Bundys' original dispute over grazing goes back decades, stemming from tensions between ranchers and environmentalists and the city of Las Vegas, as it began rapidly expanding into a protected desert tortoise's habitat. Bundy was seen as the last rancher in southern Nevada who refused to get out of the business. But in the years since, his critics say the family's fight has devolved into far right extremism, and a widely debunked legal theory that counties and states, not the federal government, should own public land. ""It's like the COVID-19 virus, they mutate as to their belief system so much that you can never tell what they're going to advocate,"" Shea said. ""They are a danger to themselves and a danger to everyone else they come in contact with."" Indeed, the pandemic has lately brought an opportunity to breathe new life to the Bundys and their self-described patriot movement that had been seen as starting to fade. Ammon Bundy and some of the family's followers have been traveling across the West leading protests against coronavirus public health restrictions, protests that thus far haven't drawn huge numbers. At one recent march in Washington state that was streamed on Facebook, activist Kelli Stewart decried the business closures: ""Come on guys, this is the American way, open rebellion to tyrannical laws, we're not slaves."" A rebellious fight against tyranny, or justice against a family that has flaunted the law for decades, that's a question now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The court takes up the appeal for a retrial in USA vs. Bundy in a virtual session on Friday. ",0.0

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced the charges Friday, shortly after Chauvin was taken into custody by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The announcement comes days after the release of a video that shows Chauvin's knee pressed firmly on the black man's neck for at least seven minutes. That video has inspired outrage nationwide and unrest in Minneapolis and had led to Chauvin's firing as well as that of three other officers seen in the video. Asked why Chauvin wasn't arrested earlier — something demanded by protesters and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — Freeman said his office moved as quickly as possible in its investigation. He added that the three other former officers remain under investigation and that he anticipates charges for them, too. The Department of Justice is also conducting an investigation on ""a separate and parallel track,"" U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Friday in a statement. ""Both state and federal officers are working diligently and collaboratively to ensure that any available evidence relevant to these decisions is obtained as quickly as possible,"" Barr said. Those investigations, coupled with the officers' firings, has so far failed to satisfy the protesters who had gathered for a third night Thursday in Minneapolis. Some of them stormed the 3rd Police Precinct, the closest precinct to the site of Floyd's arrest, setting fire to that building after police withdrew in an attempt to mitigate tensions. Rioters burned and looted other buildings in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The region has seethed since the release of the video depicting Floyd's arrest, which shows Floyd crying for help before falling silent, while bystanders shout that he's dying. The officer did not remove his knee until paramedics showed up to move Floyd's unresponsive body into an ambulance. He was reported dead later Monday night. In an attempt to avoid another night of chaos, officials ordered a nighttime curfew in Minneapolis and St. Paul beginning at 8 p.m. local time Friday and Saturday nights and continuing until 6 a.m., although the curfew was widely ignored. Here is the latest on the situation: Floyd's family: ""We want a first-degree murder charge"" Floyd's family said that prosecutors have made ""a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice,"" in a statement issued shortly after the announcement that Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. But they feel that authorities haven't gone far enough. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested. We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer,"" the family said in a statement shared by their attorney. In Minnesota, a third-degree murder conviction can result in up to 25 years in prison, while murder in the first degree brings a possible life sentence. ""The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw,"" the family added, ""and is spilling out onto streets across America."" Gov. Tim Walz: ""I understand clearly there is no trust"" During a news conference Friday morning, the Minnesota governor acknowledged the pain of those outraged by Floyd's death in police custody — whose name he added to a list of ""unheard"" black men killed by police, including Philando Castile, who was shot in 2016 by police in a suburb of St. Paul. ""The very tools that we need to use to get control to make sure that buildings aren't burned and the rule of law doesn't collapse are those very institutional tools that have led to that grief and pain. I understand clearly there is no trust in many of our communities,"" Walz told reporters. ""But I'm asking you to help us use humane ways to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice, so that those that are expressing rage and anger and demanding justice are heard."" President Trump's tweet about ""THUGS"" flagged for glorifying violence The president, who called Floyd's death ""very sad and tragic"" earlier this week, said early Friday that he had told Minnesota's governor that ""the Military is with him all the way."" He also described the source of the unrest as ""THUGS"" — a word widely criticized for bearing racial overtones. ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" he continued in a tweet partially hidden and flagged by Twitter for violating its policy against ""glorifying violence."" Trump did not miss the social network's decision. Not long after the move, the president — who signed an executive order Thursday aimed at limiting the legal protections afforded to social media companies such as Twitter — took aim at the company with a tweet saying it ""will be regulated."" Trump later sought to clarify his initial tweet, saying that shooting simply can occur when looting gets out of hand. ""It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,"" Trump explained in a pair of tweets. ""It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media."" In a tweet of his own, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said he is ""furious"" that Trump ""is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many."" Gov. Walz apologizes for brief arrest of CNN crew On Friday morning, state police arrested a CNN crew while it was reporting about the unrest on live television: ""A black reporter from CNN was arrested while legally covering the protests in Minneapolis,"" the network pointedly noted. ""A white reporter also on the ground was not."" The crew of correspondent Omar Jimenez, producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez was released about an hour later, and Walz repeatedly apologized during his news conference Friday. ""A few minutes after hearing [about the arrest] I was on a call with CNN President Jeff Zucker, who demanded to know what happened. I take full responsibility,"" Walz said Friday. ""There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen. Calls were made immediately. This is a very public apology to that team. It should not happen."" The swift backtrack did little to soften the shock of the spectacle, though. ""With all the perversions of American democracy that we have witnessed, few rival the dystopian spectacle of a U.S. journalist calmly reporting the news and repeatedly offering to reposition his crew at the police's request, only to be arrested, cuffed and hauled away alongside his crew,"" said Suzanne Nossel, CEO of PEN America, advocacy group that fights for press freedom. She added: ""For us at PEN America, where we routinely document the arrest and imprisonment of writers and journalists worldwide, the action was eerily familiar, but something we expect to see in authoritarian states: Turkey, Hong Kong, Egypt. To see it in the United States of America is appalling."" Obama and others nationwide respond to Floyd's death Demonstrators in Minneapolis are not alone in their outrage over Floyd's death. Activists spilled onto city streets across the country, holding protests seeking justice for the Minneapolis man as well as other unarmed black men and women who have died at the hands of law enforcement officers or in police custody. Large protests were held outside the White House and outside the CNN headquarters in Atlanta, as well as in cities including New York, Houston and San Jose, Calif. Among those who took to social media to express their pain and frustration Friday was former President Barack Obama. ""It's natural to wish for life 'to just get back to normal' as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly 'normal' – whether it's while dealing with the health care system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park,"" Obama said in a statement posted to social media. In speaking of jogging and bird-watching, the former president referred to two other videos that have inspired outrage this month — one in which a black man was followed and killed by two white men while out for a run in Georgia, and another in which a white woman called police on a black bird-watcher in New York City after he asked her to leash her dog. ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" Obama said. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" My statement on the death of George Floyd: pic.twitter.com/Hg1k9JHT6R — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) May 29, 2020 Protesters have turned out to express their outrage as far as Los Angeles and New York City. Meanwhile in Louisville, Ky., demonstrators gathered Thursday to protest death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot by police during a no-knock raid on her home in March. Those protests turned violent, as well, with several people reported shot amid the melee. As one protester in Minneapolis told NPR, the anger over Floyd's death is about more than just one man — it's about how police treat black people across the U.S. ""This is how our people react, you know? When we've been done wrong for so long,"" he said. ""So, me, I'm just praying and hoping everybody makes it home safe."" NPR's Adrian Florido contributed to this report. ",0.0

A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. ADVERTISING Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket and cheering. Late Thursday, President Donald Trump blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said on Twitter. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd was arrested. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request, but it wasn’t immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was “here with the Minneapolis Fire Department” to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to fires at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings. Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses. Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby. But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice. Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence. “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black. Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing. Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters. “We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.” The group marched peacefully for three hours before another confrontation with police broke out, though details were scarce. After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said. Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed. “WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition. Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing. “We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station. “What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. “They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.” The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage. Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city’s response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. “If the strategy was to keep residents safe — it failed,” City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. “Prevent property damage — it failed.” On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets. Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said. Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes. The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited. ADVERTISING The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated. Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard.",0.0

Louisville Metro Police confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn’t provide a number. ADVERTISING “No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city’s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. The protests stretched for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. “Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor’s mother. “As Breonna’s mother says let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice.” Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home. Attention on Taylor’s death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February. Thursday’s demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody. Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor’s family. “Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna’s name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.” Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” A small fire inside a trash can was visible in the middle of the street. Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up around Louisville City Hall. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd. Protesters were shown filming police with their cellphones. ADVERTISING Kentuckians are still under social distancing mandates driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Many protesters wore masks. Chants early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.”",0.0

China’s passage of a national security law for the city is the latest sign that the 50-year “one country, two systems” arrangement that allowed Hong Kong to keep its own legal, financial and trade regimes is perishable. China’s communist leaders have been preparing for decades to take full control of the glittering capitalist oasis, while building up their own trade and financial centers to take Hong Kong’s place. For them, national security and patriotism trump the civil liberties that brought millions of Hong Kong residents into the streets last year, hoping to protect their own vision for their future — protests that would not be tolerated across the border. In the early 1980s, as China’s own economy began to open up to trade and investment after decades of Cold War isolation and political upheaval, the contrast between the mainland and Hong Kong was evident on crossing the border into the bucolic rice paddies and fish ponds of Shenzhen. Several generations later, Shenzhen is a metropolis of skyscrapers, high-tech campuses and huge, modern ports that dwarf Hong Kong’s own, at least in trading volume. Railways, roads, bridges and other infrastructure have transformed the Pearl River Delta region that surrounds it into a whole ecosystem of built-up cities that is China’s answer to Silicon Valley and then some. It also is home to increasingly influential tech companies like Huawei Technologies and Tencent. Railways, roads, bridges and other infrastructure have turned Hong Kong into just one of the big cities of the Pearl River Delta region that surrounds it. The region has been transformed into a whole ecosystem of built-up cities that is China’s answer to Silicon Valley and then some, and it is home to increasingly influential tech companies like Huawei Technologies and Tencent. “Hong Kong is a Chinese city,” said Kenneth Courtis, an expert on Asian economies and chairman of Starfort Investment Holdings. Instead of Hong Kong transforming its neighbors in Guangdong province, he said, “it’s more likely that Hong Kong will be more and more absorbed into Guangdong.” The rise of industrial and financial centers like Shenzhen and Shanghai has sidelined Hong Kong in other respects. The city accounts for less than 3% of China’s economic activity, down from a peak of 27% in 1993, the height of its role as go-between in China’s ascent as an export powerhouse. China’s promise to leave Hong Kong’s own legal and economic systems intact for 50 years, until 2047, has helped the city of 7 million retain its attraction as a regional financial hub and bastion of Western-style civil liberties. The national security law endorsed in Beijing followed recent arrests of Hong Kong pro-democracy advocates. Critics say it will undermine civil liberties and might be used to suppress political activity, and many in Hong Kong reacted with dismay. Many of the millions of Hong Kong citizens who turned out in protests that began a year ago either escaped from the mainland or have parents that left decades ago. Having fled communist rule, they are clinging to liberties forbidden in mainland China, where public dissent is treated as subversive and punishable by long prison terms. “The most frightening thing is that you will never be able to know exactly what would cross the bottom line for the Chinese Communist Party, or even where that bottom line is. No one knows,” said Philip Chan, who was walking in downtown Hong Kong’s Central district under the watchful eyes of masses of police in riot gear, a common sight nowadays. Hong Kong’s government has insisted that the new security law will only affect a small minority of people, saying that life will continue as normal for most. The city’s tycoons planted the seeds both for its success and its eventual undoing when they invested billions in Guangdong, across the border, taking advantage of special incentives and cheap labor, and eventually helping turn China into the world’s factory floor. For the most part, those ultra-wealthy elites have sought to keep the peace with Beijing in return for wielding enormous influence both in local politics and business. Billionaire Li Ka-shing, whose fortune has taken a hit over the past year as Hong Kong’s economy stumbled, told local media that he viewed Beijing’s moves as its “sovereign right.” He and his peers have voiced support for the security legislation, saying they hope it will help ensure public order. Beijing’s insistence on enacting the national security law, among other measures including now-tabled extradition legislation that sparked months of anti-government protests last year, prompted Washington to announce it no longer will treat Hong Kong as being autonomous from Beijing. It’s unclear whether the Trump administration will push ahead with the threat to no longer treat Hong Kong as an autonomous free port or how big the impact of such a move would be. Hong Kong accounted for about 8% of China’s exports to the U.S. and about 6% of its imports from the U.S. in 2018, but its overall role in trade has been eclipsed by big ports to the north. The city was the world’s second-biggest port after Singapore in 2005 and now is the eighth-largest: Shanghai is by far the biggest and its throughput has doubled during that time while Hong Kong’s has fallen. The city is utterly dependent on the mainland for much of its water, most of its food, and to a large extent, tourism and investment. Before the protests and later the coronavirus pandemic virtually wiped out tourism, the city was a thriving cosmopolitan destination. It’s a shopping and dining mecca with a vibrant cultural scene, strong traditions of philanthropy and historic preservation, and mass media and educational institutions largely unfettered by Communist Party dogma and censorship. At the same time, tensions have been building as the gap between rich and poor has widened. Political sentiment has become polarized as Beijing gradually extended its influence by ensuring its supporters would hold the deciding votes over such decisions as who would be the city’s top leader. “These issues are very much central to the demonstrations,” Courtis said. “Beijing would be very smart to address some of these issues. Repression isn’t the answer.” While many in Hong Kong grew frustrated with disruptions from the anti-government protests that turned violent at times, still more have shown with the votes they are able to cast that they favor more, not less democracy. Some gathered in pop-up demonstrations Friday, including dozens who were chanting in protest n the busy IFC shopping mall downtown. Jerome Lau, 70, said he feared the government would crack down on public gatherings and free speech. “Until I take my last breath, I will come out and fight for freedom,” he said.",0.0

Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the case, which sparked protests across the United States and fires and looting in Minneapolis. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest, but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wanted all the officers arrested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said more charges were possible. He said the investigation into the other three officers continues, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Chauvin allegedly disregarded the concerns of the other officer, who wanted to roll Floyd onto his side, according to the criminal complaint. The papers also said that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. The exam concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death, according to the complaint. Floyd’s family was seeking an independent autopsy. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic. Chauvin and officer Tou Thoa arrived to help and tried several times to get Floyd into the car, but he struggled, the complaint said. At one point, Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the passenger side of the car, and Floyd, who was handcuffed, went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Lane held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. Officer Thomas Lane asked, “Should we roll him on his side?” Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever,” and Chauvin said, “That’s why we have him on his stomach,” according to the complaint. After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said again that he wanted to roll Chauvin onto his side. Kueng checked for a wrist pulse and said he could not find one, the complaint said. In all, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, according to the complaint. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. Freeman, whose home was also picketed by protesters, highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd’s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. All four officers who were at the scene of Floyd’s death on Monday were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside the government center chanted, “All four got to go.” It was not immediately clear whether Chauvin’s arrest would quiet the unrest, which escalated Thursday as demonstrators torched a Minneapolis police station that officers had abandoned. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state has taken over the response to the violence and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Trump later clarified that he was referring to shooting that had happened during the protests. The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said. “You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. This morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention. “I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey took responsibility for evacuating the police precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, said Chauvin’s arrest was “a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice.” Crump had earlier called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd’s body to have an independent autopsy performed. Floyd said that talk of a heart condition or asthma is irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner as well. On Thursday, the city released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller said someone paid with a counterfeit bill and described the man as “awfully drunk” and “not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are also investigating Floyd’s death. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said that Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events that featured African American music, Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press. Santamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, “he might have given him a little more mercy.” Santamaria, who sold the venue within the past two months, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified “overkill.”",0.0

The circumstances of my friend and Keedron may be different, but their anguish is the same. It's shared by me and millions of others. It's natural to wish for life ""to just get back to normal"" as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us.

This shouldn't be ""normal"" in 2020 America. It can't be ""normal."" If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better.

1620373644,2020-05-29 14:28:31,7 Shot At Louisville Protest Calling For Justice For Breonna Taylor,https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/7-shot-louisville-protest-calling-justice-breonna-taylor,en,False,,332152,hawaiipublicradio.org,http://hawaiipublicradio.org/,"Updated at 4:27 p.m. ET Seven people were shot in downtown Louisville, Ky., at a protest Thursday evening calling for justice for a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed in her apartment by police in March. The protests started peacefully. But shortly after 11:30 p.m., gunfire erupted. It's not yet clear who did the shooting, though Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said during a Friday morning press conference that the shots did not come from police. All shooting victims are ""stable and recovering,"" Fischer said. The mayor thanked the majority of protesters who were peaceful and he expressed sympathy for those mourning the loss of Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed in her apartment on March 13 as part of a narcotics investigation. The audio of a 911 call made by Taylor's boyfriend, who was with her that night, was released earlier Thursday. The unrest in Louisville happened on the same night that protests escalated in Minneapolis, where demonstrators called for justice over the death of George Floyd. Fischer also spoke of the ""historical injustice"" felt by those in his city and throughout the country who are ""tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law enforcement."" ""We must find a way to stop this cycle of injustice,"" Fischer said before urging residents of Louisville for peace in future protests. ""The violence and demonstration and the destruction that we saw last night will not get us there. It will create more tragedies rather than prevent them,"" Fischer said. 'I don't know where the shots came from' Ryan Van Velzer, a reporter for WFPL in Louisville, described a chaotic scene in front of City Hall on Thursday. ""There were several gunshots and two people went down. I don't know where the shots came from,"" he reported. People in the crowd ran, Van Velzer reported, adding police were able set up a barrier and provide help to the victims. ""It looked like at least one man was shot in the abdomen. I saw blood,"" he said. ""Don't know what happened to the other person, but I saw them laying 5 or 10 feet away."" The station also reported that areas around the protest sustained damage by the end of the evening. ""Protesters damaged the statue of King Louis XVI outside Metro Hall and slashed vehicle tires,"" WFPL reported. ""Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets."" Louisville Metro Police Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous said at the Friday press briefing that officers fired tear gas into the crowd only after gunshots had been fired from within the crowd. The extent of the damage from the unrest is still being tallied, but Chavous said windows were broken and multiple shots were fired into buildings including a courthouse and the Louisville Metro Police Department headquarters. Two officers were treated at a local hospital. One arrest was made for disorderly conduct and failure to disperse. ""All off days for officers have been canceled as we ready to staff any additional situations that arise,"" Chavous said. She said there are no plans to bring in the National Guard, but it is possible other agencies outside of Louisville will be brought in to assist. There are more protests scheduled over the weekend, including one planned by Taylor's family in front of the mayor's office at Louisville's Metro Hall, WHAS, a local ABC affiliate, reports. The Louisville Courier-Journal reported that Louisville Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey, who watched as the streets filled with protesters, said that what happened was ""not a riot."" ""It's a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed,"" said Dorsey. ""What I'm seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration."" Violence in Louisville took place despite calls from the Taylor family to keep protests peaceful. ""We are so grateful for everyone giving Bre a voice tonight, for saying her name, for demanding truth, for demanding justice and for demanding accountability,"" Taylor's sister Juniyah Palmer posted to Facebook on Thursday. She added: ""We demand change. We demand reform. But we do not need for our community to get hurt. We need for our community to get justice."" Latest in the Breonna Taylor case Police were executing a search warrant for at Taylor's apartment after midnight on March 13. The officers say they announced their presence, then forced their way into the apartment, WFPL's Amina Elahi reported Friday on NPR. ""By then, she and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who was there with her that night were scared. And Kenneth Walker says he fired a warning shot at the police because he thought some intruder was breaking in,"" Elahi reported. ""The police fired back, more than 20 shots, and eight of them struck Breonna Taylor and killed her,"" she said. Earlier this week, Walker was released from custody. He had been charged with first-degree assault and attempting to murder a police officer, though Walker has maintained he thought the officers, who were executing a ""no knock"" warrant, were intruders. Last week, Fischer, the Louisville mayor, announced that an internal investigation into the matter had been handed over to Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron's office. A day after that announcement, on May 21, Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad said he plans to retire in June, as scrutiny over his department's handling of the Taylor case was drawing national attention. That same day, FBI Louisville announced it also is investigating the Taylor shooting. ""The FBI will collect all available facts and evidence and will ensure that the investigation is conducted in a fair, thorough and impartial manner, special agent in charge Robert Brown said in a statement.

1620399233,2020-05-29 14:30:00,CNN crew is arrested on live television while covering Minneapolis protests,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/05/29/breaking-news/cnn-crew-is-arrested-on-live-television-while-covering-minneapolis-protests/,en,False,,39573,HonululuAdvertiser,http://www.staradvertiser.com/,"A CNN reporting team was arrested live on television early today while covering the protests in Minneapolis, an extraordinary interference with freedom of the press that drew outrage from First Amendment advocates and a public apology from Minnesota’s governor. The CNN crew, led by correspondent Omar Jimenez, was released by police in Minneapolis after spending about an hour in custody. In the moments before the 5 a.m. arrest, Jimenez could be heard calmly identifying himself as a reporter and offering to move to wherever he and his team were directed. “Put us back where you want us; we are getting out of your way, just let us know,” Jimenez told the police officers, who were outfitted in riot gear, as the network broadcast the exchange in real time. “Wherever you’d want us, we will go.” Instead, he and his team — Bill Kirkos, a producer, and Leonel Mendez, a camera operator — had their hands bound behind their backs. Their camera was placed on the ground, still rolling; CNN anchors watching from New York sounded stunned as they reported on their colleagues’ arrests. It is common in autocratic countries for journalists to be swept up in arrests during protests and riots but rare in the United States, where news gathering is protected by the First Amendment. Lawyers at CNN reached out to Minnesota authorities, and the network’s president, Jeffrey A. Zucker, spoke briefly this morning with the state’s governor, Tim Walz. Walz told Zucker that the arrest was “inadvertent” and “unacceptable,” according to CNN’s account of the call. By about 6:30 a.m. local time, the crew had been released and was back on television. “Everyone, to their credit, was pretty cordial,” Jimenez said of his interaction with police officers after his arrest. “As far as the people that were leading me away, there was no animosity there. They weren’t violent with me. We were having a conversation about just how crazy this week has been for every single part of the city.” At a news conference today, Walz issued what he called “a very public apology” to CNN for the morning’s events, saying, “I take full responsibility; there is absolutely no reason something like this should happen.” His voice emotional at times, Walz said he believed that allowing journalists to bear witness to the protests, and police’s handling of the situation, was a critical component of restoring public trust. “We have got to ensure there is a safe spot for journalism to have the story,” the governor said, adding, “Not because it’s a nice thing to do. Because it is a key component to how we fix this.” In an on-air account of his detention, Jimenez, who joined CNN in 2017, said he had asked an officer for guidance on where the news media should be situated during the protests, which started in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being handcuffed and pinned by a police officer who pressed his knee onto his neck. Jimenez said the officer told him: “Look, I don’t know man, I’m just following orders.” The detention of the CNN crew sparked denunciations from press groups and prominent journalists. Christiane Amanpour, CNN’s chief international anchor, wrote on Twitter that “arresting journalists is the kind of thing that happens in dictatorships and authoritarian regimes. We live in a democracy.” Bret Baier of Fox News wrote that “this should never have happened. Period.” The head of PEN America, Suzanne Nossel, called the proceedings a “dystopian spectacle.” The arrest of Jimenez, who identifies as black and Latino, also prompted a discussion of whether he would have been detained by police if he were white. The presumptive Democratic nominee for president, former Vice President Joe Biden, weighed in on the incident in a Twitter post today. “This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free,” Biden wrote. “I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything.” Dorothy Tucker, president of the National Association of Black Journalists, condemned the arrest, writing on Twitter, “It is unfathomable and upsetting to witness this structural racism in real time.” A spokesman for the Minnesota State Patrol could not immediately be reached for comment. On Twitter, the state patrol said: “In the course of clearing the streets and restoring order at Lake Street and Snelling Avenue, four people were arrested by State Patrol troopers, including three members of a CNN crew. The three were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media.” That official statement was met with skepticism, in part because footage shows Jimenez and his team clearly identifying themselves as journalists, complete with press ID cards, before their arrests. On a morning call with network staff, Zucker, the CNN president, dismissed the state patrol’s characterization of the incident with an obscenity. “Thank goodness” a camera was there to record the incident, Zucker told his staff during the call, which was described by two people with knowledge of his remarks. Zucker went on to praise Jimenez’s “professionalism and poise,” calling the arrests “outrageous” and saying, “It’s hard to be prouder of what our team did this morning.”",0.0
1620477601,2020-05-29 17:40:00,Hundred-plus demonstrators at Hawaii Capitol protest police killing of George Floyd,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/05/29/breaking-news/hundred-plus-demonstrators-at-hawaii-capitol-protest-police-killing-of-george-floyd/,en,False,,39573,HonululuAdvertiser,http://www.staradvertiser.com/,"More than 100 people stood in solidarity this morning at the state Capitol to protest against the killing of black man who died under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer this week. The rally followed nationwide demonstrations to protest against police killings of members of the black community. Demonstrators said they were hurt and frustrated with the incident that occurred on Monday. The demonstrators, who all wore masks, lined up on the South Beretania side with fists raised high along with signs that read, “No justice, no peace,” “When police murder, who are you gonna call?” and “Am I next?” The organizers of the demonstration, Zoe Aoussou and Kaylan Bray, said they were surprised that many people came to support the cause. “We’re here to stand in solidarity for our black brothers and sisters who are faced with police brutality, and who lose their lives on a regular basis,” Aoussou said. “We’re here to show our support even though we have to fight through this pandemic. We need to remind the mainland (about) the spirit of Hawaii.” On the curb side, demonstrators wrote in chalk, “#ICAN’TBREATHE”. Those were the words of George Floyd, 46, who was pleading for air as three Minneapolis officers stood over him. One officer had his knee on Floyd’s neck. The incident was caught on video by bystanders. The footage rapidly circulated through social media, which caused a national outrage. “I can’t breathe,” Floyd cried in the video footage. “Please your knee is on my neck. I can’t breathe.” “He’s not even resisting arrest, bro,” a bystander said off-camera. Floyd said he couldn’t breathe a few more times, then moments later – silence. Today, the Minneapolis officer who was on Floyd’s neck was charged with murder. Honolulu resident Jordan Jackson, 21, said she feels numb to the violence that she sees in the black community. “Growing up as a black person in America, you get desensitized to the violence, so I wasn’t surprised when I saw all that stuff blow up on Twitter,” Jackson said. “I’m glad at least it got to a breaking point where everyone started getting together and protesting. “It’s taken way too long,” she continued. “This was a big issue four years ago, and it’s kind of sad that for 400 years black people have been fighting for a right to matter, yet we’re still here fighting for the same stuff.” Kaneohe resident Maliek French, 19, said he is fed up “with nothing being done.” “I was raised here so I didn’t grow up with a lot of other African-American culture. … But I’m getting sick of this,” French said. French added that he feels there is a distrust between the police and the black community. However, he said that Hawaii isn’t as bad as the mainland. “I can go on walks at night without explicitly worrying about getting pulled over,” French said. Jackson said racism will still be around. “I think anybody can be racist,” she said. “It doesn’t really matter. Casual racism is a huge issue here. People drop the ‘N word’ like it’s whatever, but it’s not.” The protest continued until noon before the crowd dispersed. “We’re here to show that each state needs to take a step into action in order to make changes with the systematic racism that exist in our society,” Bray said.",0.0
1620553535,2020-05-29 15:05:00,Minneapolis cop who knelt on man’s neck charged with murder,https://www.thegardenisland.com/2020/05/29/news/minneapolis-cop-who-knelt-on-mans-neck-charged-with-murder/,en,False,,67509,thegardenisland.com,http://thegardenisland.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS — The white Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with murder Friday, and authorities imposed an overnight curfew to try to stem three nights of often-violent protests that left dozens of stores burned and looted. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the case. He was also accused of ignoring another officer at the scene who expressed concerns about the black man as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a small grocery store. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest, but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants all four officers involved to be arrested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said more charges were possible. He said the investigation into the other three officers continues, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Meanwhile, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey declared a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. The order said no one can be out in public except emergency responders and people seeking medical care, fleeing danger or those who are homeless. “I know that whatever hope you feel today is tempered with skepticism and a righteous outrage,” Frey said in a statement. “Today’s decision from the County Attorney is an essential first step on a longer road toward justice and healing our city.” According to the criminal complaint, Chauvin allegedly disregarded the concerns of another officer, who wanted to roll Floyd onto his side as he was being held down. The papers also said that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. The exam concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. Floyd’s family was seeking an independent autopsy. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, the complaint said. Chauvin and officer Tou Thoa arrived to help and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car, it said. At one point, Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the car’s passenger side, and Floyd, who was handcuffed, went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back, and officer Thomas Lane held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever,” and Chauvin replied, “That’s why we have him on his stomach,” according to the complaint. After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Chauvin onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, the complaint said. In all, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, according to the complaint. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. Freeman, whose home has been picketed by protesters, highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd’s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. All four officers at the scene of Floyd’s arrest on Monday were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside government offices chanted, “All four got to go.” It was not immediately clear whether Chauvin’s arrest would quiet the unrest, which escalated again Thursday night as demonstrators burned a Minneapolis police station soon after officers abandoned it. Protests also spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for the officers. Walz said the state had taken over the response to the violence. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Trump later said he was referring to shooting that had happened during the protests. The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in. Requests from Minneapolis and nearby St. Paul for resources “never came,” he said. “You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. On Friday morning, nearly every building in a shopping district a couple blocks from the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members carrying assault rifles were lined up at some intersections, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people loot and burn their way through the neighborhood. “I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said. “It was pure hell.” Dozens of fires were also set in St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. A visibly tired and frustrated Frey, the Minneapolis mayor, took responsibility for evacuating the police precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, asked to take custody of Floyd’s body to have an independent autopsy performed. Crump said that talk of a heart condition or asthma was irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. State and federal authorities are also investigating Floyd’s death. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events featuring African American music, Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press. Santamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, “he might have given him a little more mercy.” Santamaria, who recently sold the venue, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was “overkill.” ——— Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison and Bernard Condon in New York contributed to this report.",0.0
1620553533,2020-05-29 15:05:00,"Biden speaks of racial ‘open wound,’ contrasting with Trump",https://www.thegardenisland.com/2020/05/29/news/biden-speaks-of-racial-open-wound-contrasting-with-trump/,en,False,,67509,thegardenisland.com,http://thegardenisland.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON — Joe Biden lamented the “open wound” of the nation’s systemic racism on Friday as he responded to the police killing of a black man in Minnesota. He drew an implicit contrast with President Donald Trump, who has suggested authorities could respond with violence to the protests that followed George Floyd’s death. “The original sin of this country still stains our nation today,” Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in remarks broadcast from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. “It’s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.” Biden announced his bid for the presidency last year arguing he’s uniquely positioned to unite a deeply divided country. He pointed to Trump’s response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as unworthy of America’s people and values. As the country endures another spasm of racial unrest, the central premise of Biden’s campaign is being tested. Biden is responding by positioning himself as an empathetic counter to Trump, who often struggles to convey emotion or connect on a personal level during moments of crisis. Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family and demanded justice for his death while calling for “real police reform that holds all cops up to the high standards that so many of them actually meet.” The president later said that he, too, had spoken with Floyd’s family and called them “terrific people.” Trump initially condemned police actions in Floyd’s death but later agitated the unrest by tweeting that protesters could be met with violent police resistance. He threatened to take action to bring Minneapolis “under control,” called violent protesters outraged by the killing “thugs” and revived a civil-rights-era phrase fraught with racist overtones. “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” Trump wrote in a tweet that was flagged by Twitter as violating rules against “glorifying violence.” The White House said the president “did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it.” By Friday afternoon, Trump sought to acknowledge the shocking circumstances of Floyd’s death while commending law enforcement. “He was in tremendous pain, obviously, and couldn’t breathe,” the president said of Floyd. “It was a very, very sad thing for me to see it. We also know that most policemen, you see the great job they do.” Biden, without mentioning Trump by name, made clear he would approach the presidency differently. “This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence,” Biden said. “This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now. Leadership that will bring everyone to the table so we can take measures to root out systemic racism.” Later appearing on PBS, Biden pointed more openly at Trump: “I think this president has stoked racism.” Rep. Val Demings, a Florida Democrat considered a potential Biden running mate, criticized Trump’s response. “America is on fire,” she said in an interview Friday. “And this president is standing there with gasoline. He is dangerous. He’s destructive, he’s dangerous and he can’t even rise to this occasion.” Amid the outrage, Biden tried to make the rest of the country feel what it was like to be African American in modern U.S. society. “Every day, African Americans go about their lives with constant anxiety and trauma, wondering who will be next,” he said, adding, “the anger and the frustration and the exhaustion — it’s undeniable.” Biden must go beyond establishing himself as a calming alternative to the president and demonstrate that he will take action that spurs the unity he’s promised. It’s a feat he may have to accomplish in a hurry if he wants to inspire African Americans to turn out for him in November. The task is especially critical after Biden suggested last week that African American voters who were still undecided between him and Trump “ain’t black,” a comment that some black leaders said were interpreted as taking their votes for granted. Biden quickly said he regretted the comment. NAACP President Derrick Johnson said he believes the nation is in chaos because of a lack of leadership in the White House. But he said change will only come by putting people in positions of power who will be willing to boldly address the needs of affected communities. “I think the real question is, what are people going to do about it and how are those who are in positions of authority, and those who are seeking positions of authority, how are they going to lay out a plan moving forward?” Johnson said. “It’s about what is the collective will of this society to address the systemic deficits that we all know so well but lack the political will to address.” Moments of acute racial tension have afforded platforms for leadership from presidential candidates in the past. Robert F. Kennedy was seeking the White House in April 1968 and arriving in Indianapolis when he learned that Martin Luther King Jr. had been shot and killed. Kennedy stood on a flatbed truck and spoke about the country having to move past the terrible moments of racial strife — comments later credited with preventing unrest. Kennedy was assassinated two months later. Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza said Biden needs to use this moment to connect further with black people and create a more robust black agenda that specifically tackles the need for policing reform and more. “Black people cannot wait for an agenda that speaks to how it is that our lives will change under a new administration,” Garza said. “We currently have a president who is inciting violence against black communities and yet, on the other hand, we have somebody who wants to lead this country that needs to go further in their plans, proposals and their vision for how to make sure that we deal with the state of emergency that black communities are facing.” “It is not enough to engage in politics as usual,” Garza added, “and expect results, as usual.” ——— Stafford reported from Detroit.

1620553530,2020-05-29 15:05:00,Biden ally sees Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate,https://www.thegardenisland.com/2020/05/29/news/biden-ally-sees-klobuchar-as-less-likely-biden-running-mate/,en,False,,67509,thegardenisland.com,http://thegardenisland.com/#spider,"WASHINGTON — Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden’s running mate on his presidential ticket following this week’s death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said Friday. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters that while he believes Klobuchar is “absolutely” qualified to be vice president, “This is very tough timing for her.” Klobuchar, D-Minn., was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. As she was leaving the post to join the Senate, an officer involved in this week’s death of George Floyd was involved in the death of another man. The officer ultimately was not prosecuted. Clyburn, who said his view was his “gut feeling,” played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the party’s all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress’ highest-ranking black lawmaker. “So often in politics, timing really dictates things, Barack Obama I don’t think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,” Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. “And I don’t know whether he could get elected today.” On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota have “nothing to do with my running mate.” Pressed on whether Floyd’s killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he’s talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. “And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,” he said. Clyburn helped revive Biden’s badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive triumph in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party’s presumptive nominee. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, was prosecutor of Minnesota’s largest county, which includes Minneapolis. While Klobuchar was in that job, more than two dozen citizens died during encounters with police but none of the officers involved were criminally charged. Most victims were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of the past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week’s death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breath as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. The case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar had been elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney’s office. Klobuchar did not respond to a request by The Associated Press for an interview on Friday. But she told NBC news that reports stating she had declined the case involving Chauvin years ago were “absolutely false.” Klobuchar told the network that during the years she led the office, it was the practice to present police shooting cases to a grand jury to consider charges. She said she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote a letter Friday to the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate “patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing” by the Minneapolis police. ——— AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

Trump, in a tweet after midnight today, called the protesters in Minneapolis “thugs” and said: “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The phrase was popularized by Walter E. Headley, Miami’s former police chief, in 1967 as he pledged a no-holds-barred response to a Christmas-season outbreak of violent crime in black neighborhoods that had left three people dead in attempted robberies. Headley suggested that his department’s tough tactics had kept Miami calm that year, even as race riots were convulsing dozens of other cities and leaving scores dead. “We haven’t had any serious problems with civil uprising and looting because I’ve let the word filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he said. “We don’t mind being accused of police brutality. They haven’t seen anything yet.” Hours after Trump posted his tweet, which was widely criticized for inciting violence, he tweeted about the matter again, saying, in part: “looting leads to shooting, and that’s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night.” He added: “I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night meant.” Asked by a reporter at an afternoon news conference whether he was aware of the racist history of the phrase, Trump said that he’d heard it for years, but he said he was not aware that it had been used by Headley. Headley bolstered patrols of black neighborhoods with a so-called task force of six three-officer patrol cars and five more cars carrying police dogs. The shotgun-equipped officers were authorized under the city’s stop-and-frisk law to detain and search anyone deemed suspicious without a warrant. “This is war,” he said. “I mean it, every bit of it.” The chief said his crackdown was aimed at the 10% of black people in Miami whom he called “young hoodlums, 15 to 21, who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign” to commit crimes with seeming impunity. But national and local civil rights leaders immediately denounced his remarks. Floyd McKissick, the chair of the Congress of Racial Equality, charged that Headley was “setting up the first fascist state of Miami.” The president of the Miami chapter of the NAACP, Dr. George Simpson, expressed fear that the chief was directing his force “to revert to the law-enforcement practices of 15 or 20 years ago when, in too many instances, to be black was to be guilty.” The field secretary of the group’s Florida chapter, Marvin Davies, said, “This man has no place in a position of public trust.” Headley repeated the phrase the following August in response to protests in the predominantly black Liberty City neighborhood during the 1968 Republican National Convention, which was being held in Miami. Criticized for not returning from a vacation to address the situation, he said of his officers, “They know what to do. When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The chief told Miami legislators in 1967 that his blunt remarks had been partly misinterpreted, and while running the department, he tried to cast himself as a hard-liner on crime without regard to race. Headley frequently took credit for hiring the first black police officers in the South, in 1944, and for integrating the Miami force. Under his watch the city also eliminated an all-black squad of officers — excepting its white commander — that had been established to patrol African American neighborhoods. Headley’s statements came at the peak of a yearslong wave of racial violence in American cities. The largest and most costly outbreak took place in August 1965 in Los Angeles’ Watts neighborhood after a scuffle between white police officers and two black men who were pulled over in a traffic stop. The ensuing protests led to 34 deaths, 1,032 injuries and $40 million in property damage. But the disturbances reached a climax in 1967 and 1968, two years that saw more than 150 race riots. In the worst of them, in Cleveland and Detroit, scores of people died and thousands were injured. Protests flared again in the spring of 1968 after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was gunned down in Memphis, Tenn. Many white authorities blamed the outbreaks on so-called outside agitators or radical black political groups bent on fomenting violence. But a commission appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in July 1967 to study the causes of the protests flatly rejected that the following March, saying white racism was the root of the problem. The thick report by the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders — the Kerner Commission, named after its chairman, Gov. Otto Kerner of Illinois — warned that “our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white — separate and unequal.” Miami’s Liberty City erupted in violence again in May 1980, after an all-white jury in Tampa, Fla., acquitted four white police officers in the fatal beating of a black insurance executive. In a report on the protests, the Ford Foundation called them unprecedented and likened them to slave uprisings during the Civil War. “Compared to Miami,” the report stated, “the 1960s riots were merely a warning about the hostility that lay beneath the surface rather than the outpouring itself.”",0.0

Protesters used barricades to break police vehicle windshields and jumped from car to car. Hundreds of the protesters confronted police outside CNN headquarters. They spray-painted the large, iconic CNN logo outside the building, breaking a windowed entrance. One protester climbed on top of the sign and waved a “Black Lives Matter” flag to cheers from the crowd. Protesters pelted officers who came over with bottles, striking some of them. Other bottles thrown at authorities exploded behind the police line, but no officers appeared to get hit. Protesters chanted, “Quit your jobs.” Demonstrations turn violent at the CNN Center in Atlanta. @CNNValencia reports from the ground. https://t.co/IfX7CINlGY pic.twitter.com/vIIkWGXanW — CNN (@CNN) May 30, 2020 The officers backed their line away from the group of protesters who were throwing objects at them. Police ordered demonstrators to leave the street and threatened to arrest them if they did not leave quickly. Protesters used accelerant to burn an American flag. People were watching the scene from rooftops, some laughing at skirmishes that broke out and vandalism by the protesters. Protesters were also walking on the interstate in downtown Atlanta and appeared to be trying to block traffic. The Georgia State Patrol has responded. Earlier, as the protest appeared more calm, Kaity Brackett, 27, said she came out to the protest because she thinks the entire criminal justice system needs to be overhauled, starting with policing. She said the Ahmaud Arbery killing was a catalyst for her and referred to his death as a lynching. Arbery was killed on Feb. 23 by a former district attorney investigator and his son, who were not arrested until after video emerged months later. Brackett wore a blue mask and sat with her partner and a friend. She was less concerned about the threat from the coronavirus. “We risk our lives going to the grocery store, going to get gas,” she said. “This is more important than all of that.” ——— DENVER >> Denver Mayor Michael Hancock called for calm and unity today after the first of several planned city protests over George Floyd’s death turned violent, declaring, “Let not the story be about the riots and protests. Let’s keep the focus on the life that was lost.” “I can tell you not to go out and demonstrate but the reality is it’s going to happen,” Hancock said at a news briefing, stressing he shared outrage over what he’s called the “senseless and tragic murder” of Floyd in Minneapolis. Hancock and Police Chief Paul Pazen blamed what they called a minority of agitators among peaceful protesters for inciting violence throughout downtown on Thursday. That violence included throwing rocks at police officers, setting small fires, and breaking windows and damaging cars at the state Capitol and at businesses. More protests were planned for today and Saturday. Pazen said three officers were injured and that 13 people were arrested for burglary, criminal mischief and assault. ——— NEW YORK >> Demonstrators took to New York City streets today for a second day in protest of the death of George Floyd, the black Minnesota man killed in police custody, and invoked the names of other black people who died at police hands. In Brooklyn, crowds of demonstrators chanted at police officers lined up outside the Barclays Center. There were several moments of struggle, as some in the crowd pushed against metal barricades and police pushed back. Scores of water bottles flew from the crowd toward the officers, and in return police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical at the group twice. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. Protests have taken place around the country, with some in Minnesota and elsewhere becoming violent. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, most wearing masks, where the demonstrations started today. The protest took place despite coronavirus prohibitions on large gatherings. The demonstrators were gathered in the square, while police stood across the street. “Our country has a sickness,” Petrisko said. “We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” At his Friday briefing, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he stood with the Minnesota protesters. “Nobody is sanctioning the arson, and the thuggery and the burglaries, but the protesters and the anger and the fear and the frustration? Yes. Yes. And the demand is for justice,” Cuomo said. At a news conference, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said New York Police Department officers had been told to respect peaceful protest. He also had a message for protesters. “If you are angry with the government, if you are angry with the elected leaders, direct that anger to all of us, because if we haven’t done enough, we are the ones who should be held responsible,” he said. “But the police officer in front of you is a working man or woman just trying to do their job.” ——— WINDERMERE, Fla. >> A group of about 10 protesters gathered today near a Florida town home that belongs to a white Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd’s neck. The protesters arrived after social media postings listed the address of Derek Chauvin in the community of Windermere outside Orlando. They carried signs that said, “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George,” and “We see you, we hear you … we love you! #Justice for George.” The handcuffed black man pleaded for air as Chauvin, the white police officer, knelt on his neck during an arrest recorded on video by bystanders. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office tweeted from its official account that Chauvin is not at the residence and is not expected there. The office says it’s confirmed he has no plans to be in the area. ——— ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. >> Albuquerque police used a helicopter and tear gas as they retreated from a crowd of people after a confrontation that followed a protest of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Police said officers responded to several shots being fired from a vehicle following a demonstration that had lasted hours. Four individuals were taken into custody, and several protesters became confrontational, police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos said. During the confrontation, protesters waved signs and yelled at officers clad in riot gear. Gallegos said today the tear gas was used to allow officers to leave the area and avoid further confrontation. There were no reports of injuries from the gunshots, and it wasn’t clear whether that incident was related to the protest. Gallegos also said there were no injuries resulting from the confrontation with protesters. ——— FONTANA, Calif. >> Nine people were arrested after rocks were thrown at businesses, vehicles and officers during a Southern California protest. The violence erupted Thursday night in Fontana as about 100 people moved up and down a thoroughfare and blocked traffic. Police say an unlawful assembly was declared and the crowd was ordered to disperse but some persisted. Elsewhere in the region, demonstrators gathered outside Los Angeles police headquarters but there was no repeat of Wednesday evening’s action in which protesters blocked freeway traffic and attacked two Highway Patrol cruisers. Fontana is an inland city about 50 miles (80) kilometers east of Los Angeles. ——— COLUMBUS, Ohio >> Protesters turned out for a demonstration in Columbus that began peacefully but turned violent, with windows smashed at the Ohio Statehouse and storefronts along surrounding downtown streets. The crowd of about 400 people entered into a standoff with Columbus police Thursday night, blocking the intersection of key streets in the Ohio capital for hours, the Columbus Dispatch reported. The demonstration began as a peaceful protest, but news outlets reported protesters began throwing objects like water bottles at officers, who responded by using tear gas on the crowd. A scuffle between a protester and an officer broke out around 9:45 p.m., WCMH-TV reported. Videos obtained by the Associated Press show people smashing the building’s windows. One person briefly entered an office through a broken window but retreated before troopers within the building could catch him, said Ohio State Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Craig Cvetan. Windows were boarded up early today and workers were placing plywood over undamaged windows out of precaution. ——— HOUSTON >> Today several thousand people attended a rally in front of city hall in Houston, where George Floyd grew up. The rally was mostly peaceful but police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd. The crowed marched through downtown Houston to get to city hall, blocking traffic and at times chanting “No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” Many held up signs that said, “I Can’t Breathe” and “Justice For George.” Eventually the protesters ended up alongside U.S. Highway 59, one of the major thoroughfares in Houston. A group of about 60 to 70 shut down the freeway for at least half an hour. Houston police accompanied the protesters as they marched for less than half a mile along the freeway before they walked off of it. No arrests were made. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said he welcomed the rally. “We stand with them protesting what happened in Minnesota,” said Acevedo. “I’m happy that they’re here today because people need to be heard, voices need to be heard.” One of those protesting Floyd’s death was 19-year-old Jimmy Ohaz, who came from the nearby city of Richmond, Texas. “My question is how many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed.” ——— PHOENIX >> Hundreds rallied in downtown Phoenix to demonstrate against the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in a protest that turned into a clash with police. Protesters who marched from Phoenix City Hall to the state Capitol on Thursday night into this morning carried signs reading, “Silence is violence” and “Being black should not be a death sentence,” The Arizona Republic reported. Around 11 p.m., Phoenix police declared an unlawful assembly around the Capitol building. Protesters refused to leave the area, news outlets reported. The newspaper reported that rocks and water bottles were thrown at police. Video from local TV stations shows protesters hammering on the window of a police car, and the newspaper reported at least one police car window was broken. The Arizona Department of Public Safety and Phoenix police responded by firing pepper spray and rubber bullets at the crowd. ——— PETAL, Miss. >> A Mississippi mayor who sparked outrage when he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable” about the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody is resisting calls to resign, including from his own town’s board of aldermen. “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” Petal Mayor Hal Marx tweeted Tuesday, the day four Minneapolis police officers were fired. The 46-year-old Floyd, a black man, was handcuffed and pleading for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck Monday. In a follow-up tweet, the Republican directly referenced the Floyd case, saying he “didn’t see anything unreasonable”: “If you can say you can’t breathe, you’re breathing. Most likely that man died of overdose or heart attack. Video doesn’t show his resistance that got him in that position. Police being crucified.” ——— LOUISVILLE, Ky. >> Looking to defuse tensions in Louisville over the fatal shooting of a black woman by police who broke down her door, the victim’s mother today called on protesters to continue demanding justice but to do it in “the right way without hurting each other.” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor’s mother hours after gunshots erupted, wounding at least seven people, during protests late Thursday outside City Hall. At least one person was in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police said early today. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” and all seven shot were civilians, police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to the Associated Press. In her statement, Tamika Palmer said her daughter — an emergency medical technician — devoted her life to others, and the “last thing she’d want right now is any more violence.” Thursday night’s demonstration came as protesters across the country, in cities including Los Angeles, Denver, New York and Memphis, turned out in alliance with demonstrators in Minneapolis, where George Floyd became the latest black man to die in police custody. ——— SAN JOSE, Calif. >> Roughly 300 people protesting the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis policeman have shut down a five-lane section of a highway in California’s Silicon Valley. Vehicles southbound on U.S. 101 were at a virtual standstill this afternoon, ahead of a greatly diminished rush hour as the region shelters at home. KGO-TV footage shows some cars passing on a shoulder of U.S. 101 in San Jose. Some protesters were wearing masks and some were not. Later in the afternoon, the protesters were leaving the highway. ——— LAS VEGAS >> More than 400 people were demonstrating on the Las Vegas Strip this afternoon calling for policing reforms after black man was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer. The crowd gathered in triple-digit-heat in front of the Bellagio casino-resort, holding signs and chanting “No justice, no peace!” and “Black lives matter.” They later began walking north up the Las Vegas Strip in front of casinos still shuttered because of coronavirus-related closures. The demonstration was in memory of George Floyd, who died late Monday. Bystander video showed a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on his neck.",0.0

The other provided security at a Salvation Army store and spent some of his evenings at local clubs, working as a bouncer. In the year before their fatal encounter, George Floyd, 46, and the officer now charged with his death, Derek Chauvin, 44, worked at the same Minneapolis Latin nightclub, both part of the team responsible for keeping rowdy customers under control. Their paths crossed for the last time in the waning light of a Memorial Day evening, outside a corner store known as the best place in town to find menthol cigarettes. Within an hour, Floyd was dead, his last pleas and gasps captured in a horrifically graphic video. In a move that has since prompted protests in cities across the country, Chauvin knelt down on Floyd behind a police vehicle outside the store. For eight minutes and 46 seconds, according to a criminal complaint filed Friday by the Hennepin County district attorney, the police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck in silence, staring toward the ground as his captive gasped repeatedly that he could not breathe. Bystanders waved their cellphones, cursed and pleaded for help, and still, for two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd had stopped protesting and became unresponsive, the officer continued to kneel. The case has become part of a now-familiar history of police violence in recent years in which African American men have died in encounters that were shockingly mundane in their origins — Eric Garner, who died after a 2014 arrest in New York for selling cigarettes without tax stamps; Michael Brown, who died in an encounter with police the same year in Ferguson, Mo., after walking in the street instead of using the sidewalk. Floyd’s case began with a report of a counterfeit $20 bill that a storekeeper said he tried to pass to buy cigarettes. “He died for nothing — something about a fake bill — that was nothing,” said Jason Polk, 53, a city bus driver and one of a number of South Minneapolis residents who have expressed outrage over the case. Gov. Tim Walz called the fatal arrest, and the nights of violent protests that have come after it, “one of our darkest chapters.” “Thank God a young person had a camera to video it,” the governor said. With Chauvin in custody and formally charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, prosecutors must now try to understand what happened in the chaotic moments before Floyd was taken to his Hennepin County Medical Center and pronounced dead at 9:25 p.m. Accounts from witnesses, cellphone and surveillance video and charging documents released today tell much of the story of how the “forgery-in-progress” arrest unfolded. Floyd had been a star football and basketball player in high school, moving to Minneapolis about five years ago. When he returned to Houston for his mother’s funeral two years ago, he told a cousin that Minneapolis had come to feel like home. “He was such a happy guy, he loved to be around people, loved to dance and he loved Minneapolis,” said Jovanni Thunstrom, who owned the Conga Latin Bistro where Floyd worked security on salsa nights. “He walked in every day with a smile on his face.” It was another club, El Nuevo Rodeo, where both Floyd and Chauvin worked. Maya Santamaria, who sold the club in January, said she doubted that the two men interacted. Floyd worked the occasional weeknight, she said, while Chauvin worked security on weekends over the past 17 years. Sometimes during the club’s boisterous “urban nights,” she said, when it draws a primarily African American clientele, Chauvin was sometimes overly aggressive with customers, sometimes using pepper spray, she said. “I did have words with him on various occasions, when I thought he was not reacting appropriately based on the situation at hand,” she said. “It was like, zero strikes and you’re out.” Floyd’s younger brother, Rodney Floyd, 36, said he was the center of any room he walked into. “Always smiling, always somebody you could talk to and know that you would not be judged.” The fatal encounter began just before 8 p.m., when Floyd entered Cup Foods, a community store run by four brothers, and a store clerk claimed that he had paid for cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. The police got a call from the store at 8:01 p.m. “Um, someone comes our store and give us fake bills and we realize it before he left the store, and we ran back outside, they was sitting on their car,” the caller said, according to a transcript released by the authorities. The store clerk demanded the cigarettes back. “But he doesn’t want to do that, and he’s sitting on his car cause he is awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself,” the clerk said, according to a transcript of the call to police. “He is not acting right.” The dispatcher pressed for a description, and the caller described the man as tall, bald, about 6 feet tall. “Is he white, black, Native, Hispanic, Asian?” “Something like that,” the caller replied. “Which one? White, black, Native, Hispanic, Asian?” “No, he’s a black guy,” the caller said. Not long after, Angel Stately, a regular customer and former employee, arrived at the store looking for menthol cigarettes. The police were already outside. Stately said the clerk, a teenager, was feeling bad; he had called the police, he told her, only because it was protocol. The clerk held up a folded bill and showed it to her. The bill was an obvious fake, she said. “The ink was still running,” she said. Stately said she saw an officer approach Floyd, with his hand at his gun at his hip. The charging documents say that officers found Floyd in a parked blue car with two passengers. Soon, additional police units arrived and the officers tried to get Floyd into a police vehicle. But he struggled. “Mr. Floyd did not voluntarily get in the car and struggled with the officers, intentionally falling down, saying he was not going in the car, and refusing to stand still,” according to the charging document. Even before he was placed on the ground under Chauvin’s knee, according to the prosecutors’ account, while standing outside the car, Floyd began saying repeatedly that he could not breathe. Chauvin tried to place him in the police car with Officer J.A. Kueng’s help. At 8:19, Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the passenger side of the squad car. Floyd hit the ground, face down, handcuffs still on. Kueng held Floyd’s back while Officer Thomas Lane held his legs. Chauvin lodged his left knee in “the area of Mr. Floyd’s head and neck,” the documents said, and Floyd continued to protest: “I can’t breathe,” he said repeatedly. He called for his mother. He said, “Please.” One of the officers dismissed his pleas. “You are talking fine,” one officer said, according to the charging documents. At least one officer was worried: Lane asked if the officers should roll Floyd over on his side. “No, staying put where we got him,” Chauvin replied. “I am worried about excited delirium or whatever,” Lane said. “That’s why we have him on his stomach,” Chauvin responded. At 8:24 p.m., Floyd stopped moving. Kueng checked Floyd’s right wrist for a pulse. “I couldn’t find one,” he said. Still, none of the officers moved. At 8:27 p.m., eight minutes and 46 seconds after he had lowered himself onto Floyd’s neck, Chauvin finally released his knee. The medical examiner’s office listed the time of death as 9:25 p.m.",0.0

Soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders. Soldiers in Fort Carson, in Colorado, and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. The people did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The get-ready orders were sent verbally today, after President Donald Trump asked Defense Secretary Mark Esper for military options to help quell the unrest in Minneapolis after protests descended into looting and arson in some parts of the city. >> Photo Gallery: Protests over the murder of George Floyd continue nationwide into the weekend Trump made the request on a phone call from the Oval Office on Thursday night that included Esper, National Security Advisor Robert O’ Brien and several others. The president asked Esper for rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to one of the people, senior Pentagon official who was on the call. “When the White House asks for options, someone opens the drawer and pulls them out so to speak.” the official said. The person said the military units would be deployed under the Insurrection Act of 1807, which was last used in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial. “If this is where the president is headed response-wise, it would represent a significant escalation and a determination that the various state and local authorities are not up to the task of responding to the growing unrest,” Brad Moss, a Washington D.C.-based attorney, who specializes in national security. Members of the police units were on a 30-minute recall alert early Saturday, meaning they would have to return to their bases inside that time limit in preparation for deployment to Minneapolis inside of four hours. Units at Fort Drum are slated to head to Minneapolis first, according to the three people, including two Defense Department officials. Roughly 800 U.S. soldiers would deploy to the city if called. Protests erupted in Minneapolis this week after video emerged showing a police officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck. Floyd later died of his injuries and the officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter today. The protests turned violent and on Thursday rioters torched the Minneapolis Third Police Precinct near where Floyd was arrested. Mayor Jacob Frey ordered a citywide curfew at 8 p.m. beginning today. The unrest has since spread across the country, with protests, some violent, erupting in cities including Washington DC, Atlanta, Phoenix, Denver and Los Angelas. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz ordered 500 of his National Guard troops into Minneapolis, St. Paul, and surrounding communities. But a Pentagon spokesman said Walz did not ask for the Army to be deployed to his state. “The Department has been in touch with the Governor and there is no request for Title 10 forces to support the Minnesota National Guard or state law enforcement.” Title 10 is the U.S. law that governs the armed forces, and would authorize active duty military to operate within the U.S. Alyssa Farah, the White House director of strategic communications said the deployment of active-duty military police is untrue. “False: off the record – title 10 not under discussion,” said Farah in an email response. No off-record agreement was negotiated with the Associated Press. The 16th Military Police Brigade forwarded the AP’s questions to the Defense Department. The three officials with direct knowledge of the potential deployment say the orders are on a classified system, known as the Secret Internet Protocol Router or SIPR for short. Active-duty forces are normally prohibited from acting as a domestic law enforcement agency. But the Insurrection Act offers an exception. The Insurrection Act would allow the military to take up a policing authority it otherwise would not be allowed to do, enforcing state and federal laws,”said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor who specializes in constitutional and national security law. The statute “is deliberately vague” when it comes to the instances in which the Insurrection Act could be used, he said. The state’s governor could ask President Donald Trump to take action or Trump could act on his own authority if he’s determined that the local authorities are so overwhelmed that they can’t adequately enforce the law, Vladeck said. “It is a very, very broad grant of authority for the president,” he added.",0.0
1620692026,2020-05-30 01:38:00,Biden ally sees Amy Klobuchar as less likely Biden running mate,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/05/29/news/biden-ally-sees-amy-klobuchar-as-less-likely-biden-running-mate/,en,False,,39573,HonululuAdvertiser,http://www.staradvertiser.com/,"WASHINGTON >> Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden’s running mate on his presidential ticket following this week’s death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president today. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters that while he believes Klobuchar is “absolutely” qualified to be vice president, “This is very tough timing for her.” Klobuchar, D-Minn., was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. As she was leaving the post to join the Senate, an officer involved in this week’s death of George Floyd was involved in the death of another man. The officer ultimately was not prosecuted. Clyburn, who said his view was his “gut feeling,” played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the party’s all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress’ highest-ranking black lawmaker. “So often in politics, timing really dictates things, Barack Obama I don’t think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,” Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. “And I don’t know whether he could get elected today.” On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota have “nothing to do with my running mate.” Pressed on whether Floyd’s killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he’s talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. “And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,” he said. Clyburn helped revive Biden’s badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive triumph in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party’s presumptive nominee. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, was prosecutor of Minnesota’s largest county, which includes Minneapolis. While Klobuchar was in that job, more than two dozen citizens died during encounters with police but none of the officers involved were criminally charged. Most victims were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of the past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged today in this week’s death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breathe as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. The case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar had been elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney’s office. Klobuchar did not respond to a request by the Associated Press for an interview today. But she told MSNBC that reports stating she had declined the case involving Chauvin years ago were “absolutely false.” Klobuchar told the network that during the years she led the office, it was the practice to present police shooting cases to a grand jury to consider charges. She said she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote a letter today to the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate “patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing” by the Minneapolis police. When pressed late today on the potential impact of Clyburn’s comments on her vice presidential prospects, Klobuchar told CNN, “I just can’t do politics tonight.” “I have so much respect for Rep. Clyburn and in the end, Joe Biden was a great vice president,” she said. “He’s going to make the best decision on whoever he wants to govern with.”",0.0
1620715618,2020-05-30 01:34:41,Protests Spread Nationwide On Fourth Night After Minneapolis Death Of George Floyd,https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/protests-spread-nationwide-fourth-night-after-minneapolis-death-george-floyd,en,False,,332152,hawaiipublicradio.org,http://hawaiipublicradio.org/,"Updated at 1:42 p.m. ET Saturday Angry protests nationwide on Friday followed the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. Clashes erupted between activists and law enforcement in many locations, and at least two people were dead by Saturday morning. Demonstrators nationwide have taken to the streets after Floyd died while being arrested in Minneapolis. A video shows a police officer kneeling on his neck for at least seven minutes; Floyd is heard begging for the police to stop and saying he cannot breathe. That police officer has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers were present but have not been charged. All four were fired earlier in the week. One person was killed in Detroit as hundreds of people gathered in the city's downtown area as part of the nationwide protests. As WXYZ TV, an ABC News affiliate, reported, a Detroit Police Department spokesperson said, ""A grey Dodge Durango pulled up and fired into the crowd, striking a 19-year-old man."" The shooting did not involve police. Protesters were allowed to march in the streets until shortly before midnight when officers, outfitted in riot gear, began firing tear gas into the crowds, according to the news station. Officials said at least nine people were arrested after the demonstrations were pronounced to be unlawful gatherings. In Oakland, Calif., a contract security officer for the Federal Protective Service was killed and another injured in a shooting at the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building on Friday night, according to a statement from the FBI. The service is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The officers were shot after a vehicle approached the building, and ""an individual inside the vehicle began firing."" Authorities have not linked the shooting with the protests, though the incident is under a joint investigation by the Oakland Police Department and local FBI office. In Minneapolis, after a night of rioting, looting and setting a number of businesses ablaze on Thursday, the situation seemed calmer early Friday. Officials there appeared to take a nonconfrontational approach to people marching through the city for much of the day, despite some instances of civil disorder. But as the hours passed and protesters ignored a citywide 8 p.m. curfew, law enforcement reversed course. The new strategy included deploying a column of National Guard troops, including armored vehicles, to respond to protests near the 5th Precinct. People had set fire to the 3rd Precinct on Thursday night, forcing police to abandon the building. On Friday night, protesters also reportedly were seen breaking into a Wells Fargo Bank, which was also torched. At an early morning press conference on Saturday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey urged demonstrators to go home. Walz said he understood the rage felt across the nation but condemned what he called ""wanton destruction."" ""This is not grieving,"" he said. ""This is not making a statement. This is life-threatening and dangerous to the most well-qualified forces out there."" Frey said he was ""reeling"" along with the rest of his city over Floyd's death but emphasized that ""there is no honor in burning down your city."" He pointed out that local businesses and institutions that many citizens depend on amid the coronavirus pandemic that had been destroyed. Major Gen. Jon Jensen announced the state's National Guard was preparing to deploy 1,700 soldiers. The action would be the largest deployment within Minnesota in the state's history. ""They are telling our stories, and you are disgracing their building"" In other cities, most of the demonstrations began peacefully, but as the day unfolded and night fell, they became increasingly violent. That was true in Atlanta, where a crowd of protesters outside of an entrance to CNN's headquarters on Friday evening repeatedly threw rocks at officers attempting to keep them from rushing into the building. Armed with riot gear, more than a dozen officers braced as they endured attacks from protesters with rocks, smoke grenades, and apparently BB rounds. At one point, protesters threw a flashbang that detonated in a small lobby. In response, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp issued a state of emergency around midnight. ""At the request of Mayor [Keisha Lance Bottoms] & in consultation with public safety & emergency preparedness officials, I have issued a State of Emergency for Fulton County to activate as many as 500 [Georgia National Guard] troops to protect people & property in Atlanta,"" Kemp announced in a tweet. .@CNNValencia and crew take cover after an explosion takes place in the space between protesters and police at the CNN Center in Atlanta. https://t.co/mHZFrcOZj7 pic.twitter.com/HLPzyoKgn9 — CNN (@CNN) May 30, 2020 Earlier in the day, a police vehicle was set on fire — an act of vandalism reporters have cited as a turning point in the day's activities. Bottoms pleaded with those marching in the streets to stop rioting. ""You are burning cars, you have defaced the CNN building. Ted Turner started CNN in Atlanta 40 years ago because he believed in who we are as a city. ... They are telling our stories, and you are disgracing their building,"" Bottoms said in a televised interview. Others who had surrounded CNN's headquarters, smashed the building's windows and sprayed graffiti on the network's logo. The messages scrawled on the building included insults to President Trump, along with #Love and ""no cops."" Peaceful vigil in Portland, Ore., escalates Protesters gathered peacefully Friday evening in Portland, Ore., but the demonstration eventually led to violence. Members of the crowd marched to the Multnomah County Justice Center, which houses the county jail and police headquarters. Video showed several protesters breaking windows. The police department said a small fire was lit in the building. The Portland Police Bureau later declared a riot in the city and ordered protesters to go home. In a tweet, it said people who did not comply would be ""subject to gas, projectiles, and other means necessary for dispersal."" PPB has declared a riot. The following is closed to all traffic, pedestrians and vehicles: SW Naito Pkwy west to SW 13th Ave is closed from SW Lincoln north to NW Everett St. Disperse now or you will be subject to gas, projectiles, and other means necessary for dispersal. — Portland Police (@PortlandPolice) May 30, 2020 Mayor Ted Wheeler responded to the incident on Twitter, urging protesters to remain peaceful. ""Portland, this is NOT us,"" he wrote. ""When you destroy our city, you are destroying our community. When you act in violence against each other, you are hurting all of us. How does this honor the legacy of George Floyd? Protest, speak truth, but don't tear your city apart in the process."" As the demonstrations grew more violent, Wheeler took to Twitter again, announcing that he would be returning to the city to speak to police. Wheeler wrote that he had to leave the city to be at the side of his dying mother. ENOUGH.  I had to leave Portland today because my mother is dying. I am with family to prepare for her final moments. This is hard, this is personal, but so is watching my city get destroyed.  I’m coming back NOW. You will be hearing from me, @PortlandPolice, community leaders. — Mayor Ted Wheeler (@tedwheeler) May 30, 2020 Los Angeles crowd descends on uniformed officer In Los Angeles, an angry crowd rushed into the streets amid oncoming traffic. At one point, an officer grabbed a male activist in an attempt to restrain him. After a brief tussle, a throng of protesters pulled the officer to the ground. They descended on the uniformed officer, kicking and hitting him with protest signs. Eventually, a man in civilian clothing pulled the officer out of the melee. Dozens of people later marched onto the 110 Freeway blocking all of the northbound lanes. But as the sun set, some protesters became more destructive. One group busted the windows of a downtown Starbucks and other local restaurants. Others set trash cans on fire and pushed dumpsters toward lines of police officers. At about 10:30 p.m. local time, the police department declared an unlawful assembly throughout the core downtown area. ""This is being made following repeated acts of violence & property damage,"" officials said on Twitter. We have declared an unlawful assembly throughout Downtown LA. From the 10 Fwy to the 101 & the 110 Fwy to Alameda—This is being made following repeated acts of violence & property damage. Residents should stay inside—Business should close—Those on the street are to leave the area — LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) May 30, 2020 White House on lockdown On Friday afternoon, the U.S. Secret Service temporarily locked down the White House after demonstrators gathered in protest outside the gates. Many took a knee while others chanted, ""Don't Shoot."" Football player Colin Kaepernick became well-known for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. The image is going viral again. Shortly afterward, Secret Service officials said ""personnel are currently assisting other law enforcement agencies during a demonstration"" in the park across from the White House. Law enforcement struggled with protesters over metal barricades that form one of the layers of protection around the White House. Protesters remained at the White House early Saturday morning, shoving police as they stood outside with shields. At one point, police appeared to attempt to disperse the crowd by using tear gas or pepper spray.

Protesters threw water bottles and chanted insults at police. In a video captured by a local reporter, police can be seen wielding batons and beating several protesters to the ground, and at one point spraying a crowd with a repellent, and making arrests. ""Our police officers have been given a very clear instruction: As always, respect peaceful protest. We in this city have a long history of respecting every kind of viewpoint, that is the essence of New York City,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a press conference Friday. The Associated Press reports in Brooklyn, at least one New York Police Department van was set on fire by demonstrators twice. At least 200 demonstrators were arrested Friday and a dozen NYPD officers injured, according to local reports. Seventy protesters were taken into custody on Thursday. In Denver, windows were smashed, fires burned late into the night Demonstrators in Denver gathered peacefully at noon Friday, for the second day in a row, at the state Capitol and downtown, according to local reports. Protesters chanted, ""Say his name — George Floyd,"" and other slogans but eventually struggles broke out with police. Protesters defaced a statue on the Capitol steps, and spray-painted ""I can't breathe"" and other graffiti on pillars. On the video, Floyd can be heard pleading for his life and saying he couldn't breathe. According to local reports, demonstrators broke windows and threw water bottles and rocks at police officers, who threw flash bangs, shot pepper pellets and sprayed tear gas at crowds. Tay Anderson, a Denver school board member and community organizer, said in a tweet that those who took part in violence Friday were asked to stop by protest organizers. We asked white allies to go home and some of them still insisted throwing rocks, bottles, etc. at police.  The police responded with gas and rubber bullets. I am disgusted in how allies ignored our asks to go home and stay peaceful. — Tay Anderson (@TayAndersonCO) May 30, 2020 This is a developing story. Some things reported by the media will turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene.

1620715613,2020-05-30 01:44:04,Pentagon Puts Military Police On Alert To Go To Minneapolis,https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/pentagon-puts-military-police-alert-go-minneapolis,en,False,,332152,hawaiipublicradio.org,http://hawaiipublicradio.org/,"DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — As unrest spread across dozens of American cities on Friday, the Pentagon took the rare step of ordering the Army to put several active-duty U.S. military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis, where the police killing of George Floyd sparked the widespread protests. Soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders. Soldiers in Fort Carson, in Colorado, and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. The people did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The get-ready orders were sent verbally on Friday, after President Donald Trump asked Defense Secretary Mark Esper for military options to help quell the unrest in Minneapolis after protests descended into looting and arson in some parts of the city. Trump made the request on a phone call from the Oval Office on Thursday night that included Esper, National Security Advisor Robert O' Brien and several others. The president asked Esper for rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to one of the people, senior Pentagon official who was on the call. ""When the White House asks for options, someone opens the drawer and pulls them out so to speak."" the official said. The person said the military units would be deployed under the Insurrection Act of 1807, which was last used in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial. ""If this is where the president is headed response-wise, it would represent a significant escalation and a determination that the various state and local authorities are not up to the task of responding to the growing unrest,"" Brad Moss, a Washington D.C.-based attorney, who specializes in national security. Members of the police units were on a 30-minute recall alert early Saturday, meaning they would have to return to their bases inside that time limit in preparation for deployment to Minneapolis inside of four hours. Units at Fort Drum are slated to head to Minneapolis first, according to the three people, including two Defense Department officials. Roughly 800 U.S. soldiers would deploy to the city if called. Protests erupted in Minneapolis this week after video emerged showing a police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck. Floyd later died of his injuries and the officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. The protests turned violent and on Thursday rioters torched the Minneapolis Third Police Precinct near where Floyd was arrested. Mayor Jacob Frey ordered a citywide curfew at 8 p.m. local time, beginning on Friday. In that city, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring the curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. The unrest has since spread across the country, with protests, some violent, erupting in cities including Washington DC, Atlanta, Phoenix, Denver and Los Angelas. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz ordered 500 of his National Guard troops into Minneapolis, St. Paul, and surrounding communities. But a Pentagon spokesman said Walz did not ask for the Army to be deployed to his state. ""The Department has been in touch with the Governor and there is no request for Title 10 forces to support the Minnesota National Guard or state law enforcement."" Title 10 is the U.S. law that governs the armed forces, and would authorize active duty military to operate within the U.S. Alyssa Farah, the White House director of strategic communications said the deployment of active-duty military police is untrue. ""False: off the record - title 10 not under discussion,"" said Farah in an email response. No off-record agreement was negotiated with The Associated Press. The 16th Military Police Brigade forwarded the AP's questions to the Defense Department. The three officials with direct knowledge of the potential deployment say the orders are on a classified system, known as the Secret Internet Protocol Router or SIPR for short. Active-duty forces are normally prohibited from acting as a domestic law enforcement agency. But the Insurrection Act offers an exception. The Insurrection Act would allow the military to take up a policing authority it otherwise would not be allowed to do, enforcing state and federal laws,""said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor who specializes in constitutional and national security law. The statute ""is deliberately vague"" when it comes to the instances in which the Insurrection Act could be used, he said. The state's governor could ask President Donald Trump to take action or Trump could act on his own authority if he's determined that the local authorities are so overwhelmed that they can't adequately enforce the law, Vladeck said. ""It is a very, very broad grant of authority for the president,"" he added. ",0.0

In Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and beyond, thousands of protesters carried signs that said: “He said I can’t breathe. Justice for George.” They chanted “”No justice, no peace” and “Say his name. George Floyd.” After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “Quit your jobs.” People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Demonstrators ignored police demands to disperse. Some protesters moved to the city’s major interstate thoroughfare to try to block traffic. ADVERTISING Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.” “You are disgracing our city,” she told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.” Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as the King’s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. “We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. In Brooklyn, crowds of demonstrators chanted at police officers lined up outside the Barclays Center. There were several moments of struggle, as some in the crowd pushed against metal barricades and police pushed back. Scores of water bottles flew from the crowd toward the officers, and in return police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical at the group twice. The names of black people killed by police, including Floyd and Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs carried by those in the crowd, and in their chants. “It’s my duty to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at Foley Square in lower Manhattan, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here. This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” In Houston, where George Floyd grew up, several thousand people rallied in front of City Hall. Police had apparently taken into custody a woman who had a rifle and had tried to use it to incite the crowd.

ADVERTISING “The cop who killed George Floyd,” Facebook and Twitter users claimed, wrongly identifying a man pictured laughing alongside President Donald Trump at a rally as former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin. More fake videos and photos followed as the demonstrations turned violent the next day. Some speculated, without evidence, that Floyd’s death was staged or that protesters had been paid to stir up trouble, in tweets collectively shared thousands of times. Others said a video showed a protester driving a car through a shopping complex in Minneapolis, when in fact the footage was taken during an incident at an Illinois mall last year. Since a video of an officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck first surfaced, internet troublemakers and even celebrities have posted misleading or unsubstantiated claims around his death and the ensuing protests. The social media inaccuracies have created confusion around the unfolding news, tearing at the already loosely woven seams of America’s racial tapestry. “A good deal of this, if not all of this, is intentionally trying to stoke the racial flame that has been ablaze in the United States almost since slavery started 400-plus years ago,” said Lanier Holt, a communications professor at Ohio State University who studied in Minneapolis. Minnesota governor apologizes for arrest of CNN crew NEW YORK — Following the arrest of a CNN crew on live television by police on Friday, an apologetic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised that journalists would not be interfered with in reporting on violent protests following the death of George Floyd. CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and two colleagues were released within an hour after network chief executive Jeff Zucker called Walz to demand answers about why they were led away and held in a police van. “We have got to ensure that there is a safe spot for journalism to tell this story,” Walz said. Jimenez and colleagues Bill Kirkos and Leonel Mendez were doing a live shot for CNN’s “New Day” shortly after 5 a.m. Central Time, describing a night of fire and anger in the wake of Floyd’s death after a Minneapolis police office knelt on his neck. Fired officer Derek Chauvin was charged with murder in that case later Friday. When first approached by officers, Jimenez, who is black, told them, “put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way.” Trump fuels new tensions in moment of crisis WASHINGTON — Over 48 hours in America, the official death toll from the coronavirus pandemic topped 100,000, the number of people who filed for unemployment during the crisis soared past 40 million, and the streets of a major city erupted in flames after a handcuffed black man was killed by a white police officer. It’s the kind of frenetic, fractured moment when national leaders are looked to for solutions and solace. President Donald Trump instead threw a rhetorical match into the tinderbox. “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he declared ominously in a late-night tweet. Trump’s words were so jarring that Twitter attached a warning to his post — as well as to an identical message from an official White House account — saying that the president of the United States was “glorifying violence.” It’s the first time the social media giant has taken such a step with any world leader, prompting new claims of bias from Trump and some of his conservative allies. The episode encapsulated Trump’s approach to the presidency and to this time of national crisis, which has upended nearly every aspect of American life and put his November reelection prospects at risk. He’s latched on to personal grievances and cast himself as a victim, while making only occasional references to the staggering loss of life across the country. He’s willingly stoked partisan divisions over public health, and now racial divisions in the face of a death, rather than seeking opportunities to pull the nation together. To Trump’s detractors, none of that should come as a surprise at this late stage in his term, which has been defined by such responses at volatile moments. Trump takes aim at WHO as US economic outlook worsens WASHINGTON — With new U.S. economic numbers highlighting the rough road ahead for a hoped-for rebound, President Donald Trump on Friday took aim at the World Health Organization and China, blaming both for their roles in the pandemic’s devastation. Trump announced that the United States will end its support for WHO, charging it didn’t respond adequately to the health crisis because of China’s “total control” over the global organization. Trump said Chinese officials “ignored” their reporting obligations to the WHO and pressured the agency to mislead the world when the virus was first discovered. Earlier Friday, U.S. Commerce Department statistics showed a record-shattering 13.6% drop in spending in April, a day after a federal jobs report showed another 2 million-plus Americans went out of work last week. The depth of the spending drop is particularly damaging because consumer spending is the primary driver of the economy. From wire sources The bad economic news was echoed in Europe, where an extensive social welfare net was showing signs of fraying, as protests erupted for a second day in Spain against layoffs by French carmaker Renault and Italy’s chief central banker warned that “uncertainty is rife.” Some U.S. states were going ahead with steps to reopen businesses and leisure activities needed to spur spending and restore jobs, but there were also reminders of the risks of moving too quickly. Trump strikes China over virus, Hong Kong and student visas WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced Friday that he would withdraw funding from the World Health Organization, end Hong Kong’s special trade status and suspend visas of Chinese graduate students suspected of conducting research on behalf of their government, escalating tensions with China that have surged during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has been expressing anger at the World Health Organization for weeks over what he has portrayed as an inadequate response to the initial outbreak of the coronavirus in China’s Wuhan province late last year. The president said in a White House announcement that Chinese officials “ignored” their reporting obligations to the WHO and pressured the organization to mislead the public about an outbreak that has now killed more than 100,000 Americans. “We have detailed the reforms that it must make and engaged with them directly, but they have refused to act,” the president said. “Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating the relationship.” The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO, and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. Trump said the U.S. would be “redirecting” the money to “other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs,” without providing specifics. ___ Twitter and Trump: A feud years in the making finally erupts On one side of this fraught moment: the president of the United States, facing multiple crises less than six months before the election. On the other: Twitter, the social media giant, which has grappled for years with how to handle its most prominent — and divisive — user. Caught in the middle: reality itself, and whose version gets heard over all the noise. Twitter’s decision this week to stand up to President Donald Trump by attaching warnings to some of his many tweets has been years in the making, a culmination of American divisions playing out and being amplified across social media. It is fueled by some of the very elements that make modern American discourse so polarized, so fast-moving and — at the oddest of historical moments — so fragmented. Twitter’s assumption of a stronger referee role in its approach to Trump’s tweets reflects a “pretty radical change,” said Josh Pasek, an associate professor at the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research. “We really haven’t been at a place where social media companies were willing to take on this role.” ADVERTISING But it also heightens the dangers of polarization. “When you can’t agree on the state of the world, you open up opportunities for people to question the motives of others,” Pasek said. He says that makes existing conflicts worse and de-legitimizes people with diverging views. “You make it easier to see those people who differ from you as less American.” For years, since long before he was president, Trump has used Twitter as a personal megaphone to build his personal brand, appeal to his supporters and attack his rivals of the moment. In the process, regardless of the facts at hand, he often creates his own version of reality — from birtherism to climate-change denial to exaggerations about voter fraud.",0.0

Enjoy this free story! Greater numbers of combat forces are headed to the Pacific as lawmakers and military officials increasingly focus on the threat that China poses to the United States. Read more Greater numbers of combat forces are headed to the Pacific as lawmakers and military officials increasingly focus on the threat that China poses to the supremacy the United States has maintained in the region since the end of World War II. Taiwan’s independence from China is one area of concern. Taiwanese Defense Minister Yen Teh-fa said earlier this month that the military was “still seeking an opportunity” to participate in this year’s Rim of the Pacific maritime exercises off Hawaii, Taiwan News reported. However, a U.S. official confirmed Taiwan has not been invited to the August RIMPAC drills. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, and Rhode Island’s Jack Reed, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said they intend to establish a “Pacific Deterrence Initiative” in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2021. The step comes as the divide grows between the United States and China over the rising Asian power’s expansionism. China has “unlawfully claimed territory in the Pacific Ocean, threatening freedom of navigation and international trade and they broke their word to the world on ensuring the autonomy of Hong Kong,” President Donald Trump said Friday. The Council on Foreign Relations, meanwhile, said the risk of a military confrontation in the South China Sea “could rise significantly in the next 18 months” if the relationship continues to deteriorate as a result of trade and new coronavirus disputes. “The credibility of American deterrence rests on a simple foundation. America prevents wars by convincing its adversaries they cannot win,” Inhofe and Reed said in a Thursday opinion piece in War on the Rocks, a national security platform. “Currently, in the Indo- Pacific, that foundation of deterrence is crumbling as an increasingly aggressive China continues its comprehensive military modernization,” the pair wrote. The initiative is intended to enhance budgetary oversight and focus resources on key military capabilities to deter China. “Investments in theater missile defense, expeditionary airfield and port infrastructure, fuel and munitions storage, and other areas will be key to America’s future force posture in the Indo-Pacific,” the lawmakers said. “As one example, it doesn’t matter how many F-35s the military buys if very few are stationed in the region, their primary bases have little defense against Chinese missiles, they don’t have secondary airfields to operate from, they can’t access prepositioned stocks of fuel and munitions, or they can’t be repaired in theater.” Adm. Phil Davidson, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command at Camp H.M. Smith, previously submitted a $20 billion request to Congress for added defense improvements through 2026. “Without a valid and convincing conventional deterrent, China and Russia will be emboldened to take action in the region to supplant U.S. interests,” Davidson said in the “Regain the Advantage” report. “I see a larger commitment in the region,” Gen. James C. McConville, the Army’s chief of staff, said at the recent virtual Indo- Pacific Landpower Conference 2020. In the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, “tensions are rising. China’s bullying has escalated over the last year,” said Carl Schuster, a Hawaii Pacific University professor and retired Navy captain. Gen. Li Zuocheng, chief of the People’s Liberation Army Joint Staff Department, said Thursday that “if the possibility for peaceful reunification” with Taiwan is lost, China will “take all necessary steps to resolutely smash” separatist actions, news agency Reuters reported. “We do not promise to abandon the use of force, and reserve the option to take all necessary measures, to stabilize and control the situation in the Taiwan Strait,” Li said. Schuster said inviting Taiwan to participate in RIMPAC would put other foreign participants “in a very unfortunate situation vis-a-vis China.” “China gets emotional if anybody interacts with Taiwan on any kind of official basis,” Schuster said. China would strongly protest any Taiwan involvement in RIMPAC and would potentially take economic, diplomatic or bullying action against other participating countries, he said. “We are committed to continued implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act and assisting Taiwan to make the needed changes to ensure it is best postured to defend itself and contribute to peace and stability in the Indo- Pacific,” Lt. James Adams, a spokesman for U.S. Pacific Fleet, said in a statement. He noted that Taiwan has not previously observed or participated in RIMPAC. “However, we continue to work with all who are genuinely supportive of a free and open Indo-Pacific and to find opportunities to further enhance our capabilities and proficiencies together towards that aim,” Adams said.",0.0
1621034332,2020-05-30 12:26:55,Minneapolis Overwhelmed Again By Protests Over Floyd Death,https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/minneapolis-overwhelmed-again-protests-over-floyd-death,en,False,,332152,hawaiipublicradio.org,http://hawaiipublicradio.org/,"MINNEAPOLIS — Fires burned unchecked and thousands protesting the police killing of George Floyd ignored a curfew as unrest overwhelmed authorities for another night in Minneapolis, and the governor acknowledged Saturday that he didn't have enough manpower to contain the chaos. The new round of tumult — which has also spread to other cities — came despite Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz vowing Friday to show a more forceful response than city leaders had the day before. But by early Saturday morning, Walz said he didn’t have enough troops, even with some 500 National Guardsmen. “We do not have the numbers,” Walz said. “We cannot arrest people when we are trying to hold ground.” Walz said he was moving quickly to mobilize more than 1,000 more Guard members, for a total of 1,700, and was considering the potential offer of federal military police. But he warned that even that might not be enough, saying he expected another difficult night Saturday. The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to the city on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. The rare step came as the violence spread to other cities: A man shot dead in Detroit, police cars battered in Atlanta and skirmishes with police in New York City. Criminal charges filed Friday morning against the white officer who held his knee for nearly nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a black man who was handcuffed at the time, did nothing to stem the anger. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Minneapolis police said shots had been fired at law enforcement officers during the protests but no one was injured. As the night dragged on, fires erupted across the city's south side, including at a Japanese restaurant, a Wells Fargo bank and an Office Depot. Many burned for hours, with firefighters again delayed in reaching them because areas weren't secure. Shortly before midnight, scores of officers on foot and in vehicles moved in to curb the violence, one day after city and state leaders faced blowback for their handling of the crisis. On Thursday, protesters had torched a police station soon after it was abandoned by police and went on to burn or vandalize dozens of businesses. The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association urged Gov. Walz to accept any help. “You need more resources,” the group said in a tweet. “Law enforcement needs leadership.” Not all the protests were violent. Downtown, thousands of demonstrators encircled a barricaded police station after the 8 p.m. Friday curfew. “Prosecute the police!” some chanted, and “Say his name: George Floyd!” Some protesters sprayed graffiti on buildings. Anger filled the streets of Minneapolis. Ben Hubert, a 26-year-old local resident, said he wasn’t surprised people were breaking curfew and setting fires. “I’m outraged,” he said of the Floyd case. “But I’m also sad. The injustice has been going on for so long. It’s been swelling for years.” Chauvin was also accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he pleaded that he could not breathe, while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a store. Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene, faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted of murder. An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants the other officers arrested, too. Prosecutor Mike Freeman said more charges were possible, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Protests nationwide have been fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death and years of police violence against African Americans. Protesters smashed windows at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, set a police car on fire and struck officers with bottles. Large demonstrations in New York, Houston, Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities ranged from people peacefully blocking roads to repeated clashes with police. “You are disgracing our city,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country.” Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car Monday when he stiffened and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, a criminal complaint said. Chauvin and Officer Tou Thoa arrived and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car. Chauvin eventually pulled Floyd out of the car, and the handcuffed Floyd went to the ground face down. Officer J.K. Kueng held Floyd’s back and Officer Thomas Lane held his legs while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side, Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” An autopsy said the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. It revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. There were no other details about intoxicants, and toxicology results can take weeks. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller describes the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Floyd onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. The prosecutor highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case four days after Floyd’s death and defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. Freeman said his office needed time to gather evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. Trump said Friday that he’d spoken to Floyd’s family and “expressed my sorrow.” He called video of the arrest “just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. It certainly looked like there was no excuse for it.” Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Floyd’s family, asked to take custody of Floyd’s body for an independent autopsy. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City. He was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe. State and federal authorities also are investigating Floyd’s death.",0.0

He worked with the city’s booming business community and the City Council. He reached out to minority neighborhoods and advocated for affordable housing. He implemented stricter disciplinary measures against police who violated the city’s body camera policy. When George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died Monday after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes and ignored his “I can’t breathe” pleas, Frey quickly expressed outrage and called for charges against the officer. Four officers were fired the next day, and on Friday, Officer Derek Chauvin was charged in Floyd’s death. But Frey’s leadership is being questioned after police failed to quell several nights of rioting, fires and ransacking of local businesses that followed Floyd’s death. Frey, who pleaded for calm, also approved the decision to abandon the city’s 3rd Precinct station on Thursday night, surrendering it to protesters who set fire to the building. The night the station burned, Frey appeared at an early-morning news conference after hours of criticism on social media for a police response that didn’t confront the violence despite the activation of the National Guard. As he began talking, one reporter snapped, “What’s the plan here?” Frey struggled to answer, and the next morning, Gov. Tim Walz — like Frey, a Democrat — criticized the “abject failure” of the city’s response and said the state had taken control. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to call Frey a “very weak Radical Left Mayor” and threatened to get involved. By early Saturday morning, it was Walz who found himself struggling with the enormity of the challenge, conceding that he didn’t have enough people to cope with the protests and moving to mobilize another 1,000 Guard members. Walz also took pains to praise Frey, who appeared alongside him after another night of unrest. Some wonder whether Frey’s approach to the crisis might damage his chances for reelection next year. The 38-year-old former lawyer, community organizer and one-term City Council member took office in 2018 after defeating Betsy Hodges, whose time as mayor was marred by two high-profile police shootings. The 2015 shooting of 24-year-old black resident Jamar Clark after a scuffle with two white police officers set off weeks of protests; neither officer was charged. The 2017 shooting of unarmed Australia native Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault behind her house, provoked an international outcry. The black officer in that case was convicted of third-degree murder and is serving a 12 1/2-year term. Frey campaigned partly on a promise to add police officers. But a City Council committee this spring voted against applying for a federal grant to hire 10 new officers for traffic enforcement, with one member saying he worried it would exacerbate racial disparities in vehicle stops. Community activist Mel Reeves, who said he has led rallies to protest Floyd’s killing, refused to discuss the mayor’s response except to say that Frey had been “put in a difficult position.” He said the black community doesn’t trust police and prosecutors to do the right thing. “The mayor is new, and he said all the right things,” Reeves said. “This is not about the mayor; it’s about the police department.” The day after the 3rd Precinct fire, University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs said Frey was “out of his depth” and “clearly unable to understand what he has to do to restore order while also creating the kind of healing that has to happen in Minneapolis.” He said abandoning the police station “sent a powerful message” that the city was not in control. “There needs to be another message: ‘Here is the line and order will be maintained,’” said Jacobs. “You’ve got businesses that are just shocked without words to see property going up in flames, often with no police intervention at all. You have the black community (that has) heard his words but does not believe them. “He worked really hard at those relationships and they appear to be in tatters. And I think a lot of residents are unnerved by the violence and the chaos.” Jonathan Weinhagen, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber, said the mayor still has his support, and that many businesses damaged by the violent protests, including those owned by minorities and immigrants, want to rebuild. “There is a lot of fear right now. If your store has been hit, you feel violated,” said Weinhagen, adding that some businesses already were suffering because of the coronavirus restrictions. “They were just beginning to see some light and this hit.” But he believes the mayor is “leading with his values” and getting a lot of things right, including requesting the Guard assistance and implementing a curfew Friday and Saturday nights. Jacobs, the political scientist, said Frey has been energetic, upbeat and dynamic, effectively leading the fast-growing city. But his inexperience with crisis management has shown. “Until about a week ago, he looked to be on glide path to reelection, and within a week, his mayorship looks like it’s crumbled,” Jacobs said.",0.0
1621066994,2020-05-30 12:11:00,National Guard summoned to aid cities amid police clashes over George Floyd’s death,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/05/30/breaking-news/as-anger-over-george-floyds-killing-spread-nationwide-national-guard-summoned-to-aid-cities-amid-police-clashes/,en,False,,39573,HonululuAdvertiser,http://www.staradvertiser.com/,"ATLANTA >> Governors in several states called in National Guard troops as protests over repeated police killings of black men grew today from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, where police fired rubber bullets to scatter crowds and at least one police car burned. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Monday’s death of George Floyd after a police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, have left parts of that city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. But the demonstrations have since become a national phenomenon, as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. In Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. Other peaceful protests were being held in California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. In Tulsa and Wilmington, Delaware, protesters made their way onto nearby interstates and shut them down temporarily. In Tallahassee, Florida, a pickup truck drove through a crowd of protesters, sending some running and screaming as the vehicle stopped and started and at one point had a person on its hood, police said, but no serious injuries were reported. In Columbia, South Carolina, a television reporter for WIS-TV was injured by rocks thrown Saturday amid protests outside the Columbia Police Department. Several hundred people participated in the demonstration, tearing down the American and state flags in front of the police department’s headquarters. They also swarmed a Columbia police car, breaking its windows, The State reported. In Los Angeles protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move protesters back and shot rubber bullets to scatter the crowd. One man used a skateboard to attempt to break the windshield of a police SUV. A spray painted police car burned in the streets. In Minneapolis, 29-year-old Sam Allkija, said at Saturday’s protest that the destruction that has accompanied protests is a sign of the frustration and rage the black community has felt for a long time. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force to help quell unrest that has grown increasingly destructive. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful protests in dozens of cities. The previous day’s protests, too, had started calmly — in cities from New York to Oakland, California, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon — before many descended into violence. The massive crowds involved, with many people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, raised concerns among health experts about the potential for the spread of the coronavirus. Hundreds of people were arrested Friday, and police used batons, rubber bullets and pepper spray to push back crowds in some cities. Many departments reported officers were injured, while social media was awash in images of police using forceful tactics, throwing protesters to the ground, using bicycles as shields, and trampling a protester while on horseback. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals in Los Angeles. During the five days of rioting in 1992, more than 60 died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It comes in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. On Friday, the officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter — but that appeared to provide little balm. Many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Comments from President Donald Trump stoked the anger, when he fired off a series of tweets criticizing Minnesota’s response, ridiculing people who protested outside the White House and warning that if protesters breached the fence, “they would … have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and offered sympathy for those who were protesting — but as unrest intensified, many spoke of the desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy handed tactics. The unrest prompted responses across the globe. A top Vatican cardinal, Peter Turkson who is from Ghana, urged pastors in the United States to plead for calm, while U.S. national soccer player Weston McKennie wore an armband referencing Floyd’s death while playing for Schalke in Germany’s Bundesliga. Minnesota has steadily increased the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and has now called up 1,700. The governor is also considering a potential offer of military police, which the Pentagon put on alert. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, and Cincinnati. A person was killed in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV near the Greektown entertainment district, police said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. And police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who had climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. Atlanta saw some of the most extreme unrest. While crews in that city worked to clean up glass and debris from rioting the night before, a large electronic billboard on Saturday morning still carried the message, “If you love Atlanta PLEASE GO HOME,” echoing the mayor’s pleas. National Guard members blocked anyone from approaching heavily damaged buildings, including the College Football Hall of Fame and nearby restaurants. Video posted to social media showed New York City officers using batons and shoving protesters down as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Underscoring that Floyd’s killing is part of a pattern, the names of black people killed by police, including Eric Garner, who died on Staten Island in 2014, were on signs and in chants. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.”",0.0

The Oakland shooting occurred after a vehicle pulled up outside the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building at about 9:45 p.m. Friday. Someone opened fire at two contract security officers who worked for Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service, killing one and critically wounding the other, authorities said. The officers protect federal court houses as part of their regular duties. DHS officials said they were monitoring the Oakland protest over the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. The identities of the officers have not been released. A suspect hasn’t been named and it wasn’t immediately known whether authorities have determined if the shooting was connected with the protest. Federal officials said they’re seeing more threats and assaults against law enforcement officers at protests and said they will step up security measures to protect them. “There are currently threats by some to attack police stations and federal buildings, Cuccinelli said. “That violence not only won’t be tolerated, we are also committed to ensuring that it won’t succeed anywhere, anywhere.” The protest in downtown Oakland began peacefully but spiraled into chaos late into the night. Some demonstrators smashed windows, set fires and threw objects at officers. Police said 13 officers were injured. The federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein condemned the violence, “We have to know right from wrong and not use the terrible tragedy in Minneapolis to perpetrate more violence.” she said “There’s never an excuse to shoot and kill a security guard, destroy businesses or injure innocent people.”",0.0

In a series of tweets hours after hundreds of demonstrators had massed outside the White House and scraped with officers in riot gear, Trump belittled them, doubted their allegiance to Floyd’s memory, said they were only out “to cause trouble” and were “professionally managed.” He offered no evidence to back his assertions, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: “Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” Trump said he had “watched every move” from inside the executive mansion and “couldn’t have felt more safe” as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, “but whenever someone … got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard — didn’t know what hit them.” The president also directed social media criticism at the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. The Secret Service said in a statement today that six protesters were arrested and “multiple” officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. Floyd is the black man who was being held in handcuffs when he died Monday in Minneapolis after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Protests have erupted in U.S. cities in the days since. Trump’s reference to “vicious dogs” potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In contrast with the president’s tweets, the Secret Service said it “respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.” Trump’s tweets came hours before he planned to leave for the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to take another crack at witnessing the first launch on American soil in nearly a decade of astronauts into space. He visited Cape Canaveral on Wednesday, but the launch had to be canceled because of the weather. Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation’s capital, responded to the president by saying that “while he hides behind his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd & hundreds of years of institutional racism.” She also appealed for people in the District of Columbia and across the country “to exercise great restraint even while this President continues to try to divide us.” In protests that stretched past midnight, people hurled pieces of bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and U.S. Park Police officers who were in riot gear behind barricades around the White House. Protesters at times kicked and punched officers and wrestled over the barricades. The crowd of hundreds chanted “No justice, no peace” and “Say his name: George Floyd.” As some in the crowd grew more aggressive, police deployed pepper spray to keep them back and maintain a perimeter of officers around the White House. Fellow demonstrators came to the aid of protesters who were sprayed, their eyes red and puffy, offering bottles of milk and water to splash on their faces. By the end of the night, the protesters had stolen about 15 barricades and left police to form a line of officers holding riot shields to keep back the swelling crowd. At one point, the protesters were able to gain control of an officer’s shield and set it ablaze before trying to toss it back at the line of officers. Police used a smoke device to quickly stop them. The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering “unlawful” and ordered everyone to leave Lafayette Square, a seven-acre public park located directly north of the White House. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters. “Out of the park or you will be sprayed,” an officer shouted at the crowd. As the officers continued to push forward through the park, some protesters broke the bricks from the pavement and hurled chunks at the officers. On Thursday, as violence broke out in Minneapolis, Trump tweeted, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump later said his comments had been misconstrued. “Frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die,” he said.",0.0

""It was not enough,"" Maj. Gen. Jon A. Jensen said Saturday. Now, with a fifth night of protests looming, Jensen, head of the state's National Guard, said authorities are drastically increasing the military presence in Minneapolis. Officials expected to deploy some 2,500 soldiers and airmen by midday Saturday and will soon mobilize the state's full National Guard force of more than 13,000 — ""an action that has never been taken in 164-year history of the Minnesota National Guard,"" according to Gov. Tim Walz, who spoke at a joint news conference with Jensen. ""We understand the work that we need to do and the generational pain that went into what happened with George Floyd and that murder,"" the governor said Saturday. ""But at this point in time, nothing we do to address those inequities, nothing we do to provide justice to George Floyd and his family that I spoke with last evening — none of those things matter to any of these people who are out there firing upon National Guard, burning businesses of our communities and making intent on disrupting any semblance of civil life."" The Pentagon has also placed as many as 800 members of the military police on prepare-to-deploy orders, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. The officers would be available to assist with logistics, analysis or surveillance if requested by the governor. More than 1,000 additional Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen are activating today. This is in addition to the 700 that were on duty as of late last night. This represents the largest domestic deployment in the Minnesota’s National Guard’s 164-year history. pic.twitter.com/aV9NOFv5uo — MN National Guard (@MNNationalGuard) May 30, 2020 Less than a week has passed since Floyd's death in police custody. The disturbing video of his arrest, filmed by a bystander Monday evening in Minneapolis, shows Officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on the neck of the handcuffed black man for more than seven minutes. The white police officer — who has since been fired and charged with murder — continues to plant his weight on Floyd well after his pleas for help give way to an unresponsive silence. A federal investigation remains underway into the incident, with more charges possible for Chauvin and the three other officers seen in the video. That has not satisfied protesters, whose furor over Floyd's death has spread well beyond Minneapolis. A slew of cities — from Detroit to Atlanta, from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. — have seen protesters gather to voice their outrage about police treatment of African Americans. In many of those cities, gatherings turned violent, with some protesters clashing with police and damaging buildings. Law enforcement reported hundreds of arrests across the country and at least one death — a 19-year-old man who was killed when someone fired into a crowd in Detroit, according to local police. Several people were also injured by gunfire Thursday night in Louisville, Ky., where crowds have gathered to protest a grievance closer to home: the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot and killed by police in her own apartment earlier this year. There were no incidents of gun violence linked to the protests Friday night in Louisville, but NPR member station WFPL reports that clashes erupted between protesters and police. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to WFPL. On Saturday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that he, too, was calling up the National Guard, in order ""to help keep peace in Louisville."" ""I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,"" Beshear said in a statement explaining the move. ""But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe."" President Trump weighed in on the protests Saturday. He said the best way to honor Floyd's memory is for authorities to ""get tougher"" on the protesters who resort to violence, whom he called ""radical left, bad people [who] have got to be taught that you can't do this."" ""They've got to be tough, they've got to be smart,"" Trump said of state officials. ""We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call on our military. But we could have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military."" In a statement Saturday, Attorney General William Barr echoed Trump's comments, saying that though the outrage is ""real and legitimate,"" the protests are ""being hijacked by violent radical elements."" ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda,"" Barr said. ""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.""

Jonathan Rath Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said several military units have been placed on higher alert “as a prudent planning measure” in case Walz asks for help. The Associated Press first reported on the potential deployments and, citing sources with direct knowledge of the orders, named four locations from which soldiers would be drawn. Hoffman did not identify the units, but other officials said they are mainly military police. Hoffman said these are units normally on 48-hour recall to support state authorities in the event of crises like natural disasters. They are now on four-hour alert, Hoffman said. Defense officials said there was no intent by the Pentagon to deploy any federal forces to Minnesota unless Walz asked for help. If he did make such a request, federal units such as military police could provide logistical and other kinds of support to the Minnesota National Guard or state law enforcement, but would not get directly involved in law enforcement under current plans, the officials said. They were not authorized to discuss the planning publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Hoffman said Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had spoken to Walz twice in the past 24 hours and told him the Pentagon was prepared to help if needed. Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen, the adjutant general of the Minnesota National Guard, said the Pentagon's decision to place some military units on a higher state of alert for potential deployment was “a prudent move” that gave Walz more options. Earlier, Alyssa Farah, the White House director of strategic communications, told the AP that the deployment of active-duty military police to Minnesota was untrue. In an email, she referred to Title 10, the U.S. law that governs the armed forces and would authorize active duty military to operate within the country “False: off the record - title 10 not under discussion,” said Farah. No off-record agreement was negotiated with the AP. President Donald Trump urged Walz and other authorities in Minnesota to “be tough” in Minneapolis. “We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call our military, and we can have troops on the ground every quickly,” Trump said. Soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders. Soldiers in Fort Carson, in Colorado, and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. The people were not were not authorized to discuss the preparations publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The get-ready orders were sent verbally on Friday, after Trump asked Esper for military options to help quell the unrest in Minneapolis after protests descended into looting and arson in some parts of the city. Trump made the request on a phone call from the Oval Office on Thursday night that included Esper, national security advisor Robert O’ Brien and several others. The president asked Esper for rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to one of the people, a senior Pentagon official who was on the call. The person said the military units would be deployed under the Insurrection Act of 1807, which was last used in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial. Another official said Saturday, however, that federal troops could be deployed to Minnesota without invoking that act. In that situation, they would perform non-law enforcement duties such as providing logistics help. “If this is where the president is headed response-wise, it would represent a significant escalation and a determination that the various state and local authorities are not up to the task of responding to the growing unrest,"" said Brad Moss, a Washington D.C.-based attorney, who specializes in national security. Members of the police units were on a 30-minute recall alert early Saturday, meaning they would have to return to their bases inside that time limit in preparation for deployment to Minneapolis inside of four hours. Units at Fort Drum are set to head to Minneapolis first, according to the three people, including two Defense Department officials. Roughly 800 U.S. soldiers would deploy to the city if called. Protests erupted in Minneapolis this week after video emerged showing a police officer pressing his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopping moving and pleading for air. Floyd later died of his injuries. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. The protests turned violent and on Thursday rioters torched the Minneapolis Third Police Precinct near where Floyd was arrested. Mayor Jacob Frey ordered a citywide curfew at 8 p.m. local time, beginning on Friday. In that city, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring the curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. Active-duty forces are normally prohibited from acting as a domestic law enforcement agency. But the Insurrection Act offers an exception. There was no indication Saturday that Trump intended to invoke that act. It would allow the military to take up a policing authority it otherwise would not be allowed to do, enforcing state and federal laws, said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor who specializes in constitutional and national security law. The statute “is deliberately vague” when it comes to the instances in which the Insurrection Act could be used, he said. The state’s governor could ask Trump to take action or Trump could act on his own authority if he’s determined that the local authorities are so overwhelmed that they can’t adequately enforce the law, Vladeck said. “It is a very, very broad grant of authority for the president,” he added.",0.0

Video shows Tallahassee protesters walking around the truck as it stopped at a traffic light, while some appeared to speak to the driver. In one video, a bottle was apparently smashed against the widow and the truck then suddenly accelerated, knocking several people to the side, but no serious injuries were reported. Saturday’s protest demanding justice for George Floyd was one of several in Florida and dozens across the nation. Demonstrators outraged over Floyd’s death faced off against heavily-armed officers in other states Friday, with some smashing police cars, ransacking businesses and setting fires that smoldered through the night. One person was killed in Detroit late Friday night after someone in an SUV fired shots into a crowd of protesters. An officer, who is seen on video pressing his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes as Floyd begged for air, was charged Friday in Floyd’s death. Lucas von Hollen, an IT instructor at Florida State University, said participants were chanting, marching and carrying signs Saturday near the Capitol building when he heard a distinct scream of fear. He looked out a window from a second-floor work building and saw the burgundy pickup. He said it slowed down as some protesters moved aside, while others remained in place. “Then the truck revved its engines … a couple people got out of the way, but some people didn’t, and it just drove straight through the crowd,” he said. Witnesses said a group followed the truck, forcing it to stop. Tallahassee Police immediately handcuffed the driver, shut down the street and redirected protesters to another area. Police did not release the name of the driver or say whether he would face any charges, saying details would be forwarded to the state attorney once the investigation was complete. “This is an extremely tense, emotional time across the nation,” Chief Lawrence Revell said in a statement. “Mutual respect among all of us is vital. The Tallahassee Police Department supports the nonviolent gathering of protesters and will uphold their constitutional right to do so while making every effort to maintain a safe environment for our community.” Von Hollen said police responded swiftly and efficiently in full force, separating the driver and protesters before the situation could escalate, adding he felt “zero sense of danger” after taking to the streets to catch a glimpse firsthand. “Some people were carrying negative signs about the police and the police were helping them out anyway,” he noted. “It was refreshing and a reminder that, yeah it’s pretty bad in other places, but it doesn’t seem to be that bad here.”",0.0

The shooting occurred about 11:30 p.m. Friday near Detroit’s Greektown entertainment district as officers were confronted with dozens of protesters, said Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood, a police spokeswoman. She said an officer wasn’t involved in the shooting. A police report released today said the shooting victim, a 21-year-old man, was sitting in the driver’s seat of a silver Dodge Caliber in a parking lot with two other male occupants when an unknown person fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot. Police earlier said that based on preliminary information, the shooting suspect had pulled up in a Dodge Durango and fired shots into a crowd. Kirkwood said the victim was pronounced dead at a hospital and that police were still investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting. Police made more than 60 arrests during Friday’s protest. The majority of those arrested live in Detroit’s suburbs and not the city itself, Kirkwood said. “We know that the individuals from outside the city of Detroit who converged at the protest location don’t represent this city,” Police Chief James Craig told reporters Friday evening. The demonstration began earlier in the day and was peaceful as protesters marched by Detroit Police Headquarters. As evening wore on, some in the crowd became belligerent and a police commander was struck with a rock Friday evening and hospitalized. Officers, many in riot gear, confronted the demonstrators and formed lines across streets during the demonstration, but by midnight, the crowd had thinned considerably as police shot canisters of gas toward the protesters. The violence in Detroit and many other cities was sparked by anger over over Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on Monday, which was captured on cellphone video. It led to the firing Tuesday of the four police officers who were arresting Floyd on for suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill and to third-degree murder and manslaughter charges being filed Friday against the officer who used his knee to pin Floyd down by his neck for more than eight minutes, even as Floyd pleaded for air and went limp. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said Saturday in a statement that “an overwhelming number of people were engaged in peaceful protest” during Friday’s protests over Floyd’s death — a death which she said “has profoundly affected our nation.” Worthy said that while peaceful protests over Floyd’s death are “absolutely warranted,” acts of violence are not. And she urged protesters to engage in “safe, peaceful and civil protest of his murder.” “The point of protesting what happened to Mr. Floyd can be lost when violence becomes the narrative of the protest,” she said.",0.0

National Guard was called in as pockets of violence erupted during a second straight night of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and President Donald Trump’s response to it. Hundreds of people converged on the White House and marched along the National Mall, chanting “Black Lives Matter,” “I can’t breathe” and “No justice, no peace.” Protesters dragged away barricades and some broke up concrete to use as projectiles. At one point, a trash bin was set on fire. The D.C. demonstration was one of several around the country protesting Floyd’s death. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement to disperse protesters to night. He commended National Guard troops deployed in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and he also said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” >> PHOTO GALLERY: Protests continue nationwide “Let New York’s Finest be New York’s Finest,” Trump said on Twitter after returning to the White House from Florida, where he watched the launch of a SpaceX rocket. He did not talk to reporters upon his return and it was not clear if he could hear the protest over the sound of his helicopter. But for at least part of the flight, televisions on Air Force One were turned to Fox News and its coverage of the protests. Earlier in the day, he had belittled the protesters and claimed that many Secret Service agents were “just waiting for action” and ready to unleash “the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen” if protesters crossed the White House’s security fence. He pledged later to “stop mob violence.” “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,” the president said after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. “Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the missions at hand.” There were multiple incidents of protesters pushing against barricades and being repelled with pepper spray. Police were in tactical gear. The D.C. National Guard was activated at the direction of the secretary of the Army after a request from the Park Police to help maintain order near the White House, Commanding Gen. William J. Walker said in a post on the Guard’s Facebook page. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys,” she said. During one confrontation, protesters took down a barrier and one person threw an electric scooter at the police. An activist wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt put himself between police and the protesters and yelled, “Stop. This is what they want.” Speaking over a megaphone earlier in the evening, Cameron McCall said, “We don’t need violence. All we need are our voices.” While some protesters stayed near the White House, others marched through the streets chanting, “No justice and no peace.” and “Say his name: George Floyd.” The mood was angry and several speakers implored marchers to remain peaceful. At multiple stops along the march, protesters verbally abused lines of uniformed police officers with riot shields. The march paused between the the Washington Monument and the African-American Museum and demonstrators sat down in the street for a nine-minute moment of silence for the nine minutes that the Minneapolis police officer knelt on George Floyd’s neck. . At the Lincoln Memorial, one organizer spoke over a megaphone “Look to the left and to the right and thank that person. We can’t hug anybody because of COVID but I love you anyway.” Many of the protesters wore masks, but did not socially distance themselves. Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. During an earlier skirmish, protesters threw bottles and eggs at Secret Service officers on the edge of Lafayette Square and pepper spray was used to disperse them, according to a reporter for radio station WTOP. “After a long stalemate the Secret Service, in full tactical gear, pushed forward and cleared the intersection, and there was a cloud of pepper spray and people ran backwards as fast as they could. It was almost a mad stampede,” said WTOP digital editor Alejandro Alvarez. In a series of tweets earlier today, Trump doubted their allegiance to Floyd’s memory, saying they were “professionally managed.” He offered no evidence to back his assertion, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: “Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” Trump later rejected the suggestion that he was stoking a potential conflict between protesters and his supporters. “I was just asking. But I have no idea if they are going to be here,” he said. “MAGA is Make America Great Again. By the way, they love African American people. They love black people.” At today’s demonstration, there was no evidence of a counter-move by Trump supporters. Trump said he had “watched every move” from inside the executive mansion during Friday’s protest and “couldn’t have felt more safe” as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, “but whenever someone … got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard — didn’t know what hit them.” The president also criticized the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. Trump said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “is probably a very good person, but he’s a radical, left mayor.” He then described how he watched as a police station in the city was overrun. “For that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I’ve never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life,” Trump said when speaking briefly to reporters at the White House. He said Minnesota officials have to get tougher with rioters, and that by doing so they would be honoring the memory of Floyd. The Secret Service said in a statement today that six protesters were arrested in Washington and “multiple” officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf today called the protesters “criminals” who committed “acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.” Wolf said the Secret Service was “evolving and adapting to the changing nature of the threats they face.” Floyd is the black man who was being held in handcuffs when he died Monday in Minneapolis after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Protests have erupted in U.S. cities in the days since. As he tweeted, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were “just waiting for action” and ready to unleash “the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” His reference to “vicious dogs” potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference this afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation’s capital, called Trump’s remark’s “gross” and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation’s fight against segregation. “I call upon our city and our nation to exercise restraint, great restraint, even as the president tries to divide us,” she said. “I feel like these comments are an attack on humanity, an attack on black America, and they make my city less safe.” In contrast with the president’s tweets, the Secret Service said it “respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.” In protests that stretched into the early hours today, people hurled pieces of bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and Park Police officers who were in riot gear behind barricades around the White House. Protesters at times kicked and punched officers and wrestled over the barricades. As some in the crowd grew more aggressive, police deployed pepper spray to keep them back and maintain a perimeter of officers around the White House. The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering “unlawful” and ordered everyone to leave Lafayette Square, a seven-acre public park located directly north of the White House. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters. “Out of the park or you will be sprayed,” an officer shouted at the crowd.",0.0

Some leaders appealing for calm in places where crowds smashed storefronts and destroyed police cars in recent nights have been handing out masks and warning demonstrators they were putting themselves at risk. “If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said this evening. “There is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” Minnesota’s governor said too many protesters weren’t socially distancing or wearing masks after heeding the call earlier in the week. But many seemed undeterred. “It’s not OK that in the middle of a pandemic we have to be out here risking our lives,” Spence Ingram said Friday after marching with other protesters to the state Capitol in Atlanta. “But I have to protest for my life and fight for my life all the time.” Ingram, 25, who was wearing a mask, said she has asthma and was worried about contracting the virus. But she said as a black woman, she always felt that her life was under threat from police and she needed to protest that. The demonstrations over the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee into his neck, are coming at a time when many cities were beginning to relax stay-at-home orders. That’s especially worrisome for health experts who fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at gatherings with people packed cheek to jowl and cheering and jeering without masks. “Whether they’re fired up or not that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. Even for the many protesters who have been wearing masks, those don’t guarantee protection from the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cloth masks because they can make it more difficult for infected people to spread the virus — but they are not designed to protect the person wearing the mask from getting it. The U.S. has been worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 1.7 million cases and over 103,000 deaths, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. In New York, where more than 21,000 people have died during the pandemic, a large crowd in Brooklyn tossed water bottles at officers and torched a police van Friday outside the Barclays Center. Officers cleared the crowd by spraying an eye-irritating chemical. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said after another night of unrest in Minneapolis that many protesters wearing masks were simply trying to hide their identities and “cause confusion and take advantage of this situation.” “I will continue to stress, because it seems like a lifetime ago: We are still in the middle of a pandemic and passed 1,000 deaths yesterday. We still have hospitals on the verge of being overrun with COVID-19,” he said. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey echoed those concerns: “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other.” The state’s health commissioner had warned just days earlier that the massive protests were almost certain to fuel new cases of the virus. Minnesota reported 35 deaths on Thursday, a single-day high since the start of the outbreak, and 29 more on Friday. But it wasn’t just protesters at risk — unmasked officers stood within arm’s reach of shouting demonstrators. In Atlanta, police Chief Erika Shields waded into a crowd without a mask Friday while she listened to people air frustrations. When Los Angeles officials announced earlier in the week that the city was relaxing stay-at-home orders and reopening stores, they said political protests could resume but with a cap of 100 people. Several hundred people showed up for a protest organized by Black Lives Matter-LA and later shut down a freeway. Most wore masks, but many did not observe a buffer zone. Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Friday that was an ongoing concern. “Show respect for each other by putting on that face covering so that your respiratory droplets aren’t unintentionally getting into somebody else’s mouth, nose or eyes,” she said. Those same concerns surfaced today in Paris when unions flouted a ban on large gatherings at a march to protest conditions for workers in the country illegally. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and said they had banned the march due to the “health risks that such an event is likely to generate.” Meanwhile, the European Union today urged President Donald Trump to rethink his decision to terminate the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization as spiking infection rates in India and elsewhere reinforced that the pandemic is far from contained. Trump on Friday charged that the WHO didn’t respond adequately to the pandemic and accused the U.N. agency of being under China’s “total control.” The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO, and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. The head of the EU’s executive arm urged Trump to reconsider. “The WHO needs to continue being able to lead the international response to pandemics, current and future,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Germany’s Funke media group that Trump’s decision was the “wrong signal at the wrong time.” In China, where the virus outbreak began, only four new confirmed cases were reported today, all brought from outside the country. More than 6 million coronavirus infections have been reported worldwide, with over 368,000 deaths and more than 2.5 million recoveries, according to the Johns Hopkins tally. The true death toll is widely believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested for it. Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday, but without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation overall remained precarious. “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment,” he said. “We have to get this right.” India registered another record single-day jump of 7,964 cases and 265 deaths. The government had been expected to end a 2-month-old nationwide lockdown but instead extended measures in some areas due to coronavirus outbreaks. Italy, though, added 111 new victims to its death toll and nearly 420 new infections, in line with its recent daily tallies, suggesting the virus is under control nearly four weeks after the country began gingerly loosening a strict lockdown in the onetime European epicenter of the pandemic.",0.0
1621234192,2020-05-30 21:45:00,Officials blame differing groups of ‘outsiders’ for violence,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/05/30/breaking-news/officials-blame-differing-groups-of-outsiders-for-violence/,en,False,,39573,HonululuAdvertiser,http://www.staradvertiser.com/,"WASHINGTON >> As protests over the death of George Floyd grow in cities across the U.S., government officials have been warning of the “outsiders” — groups of organized rioters they say are flooding into major cities not to call for justice but to cause destruction. But the state and federal officials have offered differing assessments of who the outsiders are. They’ve blamed left-wing extremists, far-right white nationalists and even suggested the involvement of drug cartels. These leaders have offered little evidence to back up those claims, and the chaos of the protests makes verifying identities and motives exceedingly difficult. Police officers across the country were gearing up today for another night of potentially violent clashes in major cities. Some states had even called in the National Guard to aid overwhelmed police. The finger pointing on both sides of the political spectrum is likely to deepen the political divide in the U.S., allowing politicians to advance the theory that aligns with their political view and distract from the underlying frustrations that triggered the protests. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on today told reporters he’d heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence and that even drug cartels “are trying to take advantage of the chaos.” John Harrington, the state’s commissioner of public safety, later said they had received intel reports on white supremacists. “But I cannot say that we have confirmed observations of local law enforcement to say that we’ve seen cells of white supremacists in the area,” he said today. But federal officials later pointed “far left extremist groups.” President Donald Trump alleged the violence was “being led by Antifa and other radical groups.” Antifa, short for anti-fascists, is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Attorney General William Barr later seemed to echo Trump’s assertion, saying the violent incidents in Minneapolis were driven by groups using “Antifa-like tactics.” Barr vowed that federal prosecutors across the country would use federal riots statutes to charge protesters who cross state lines to participate in violent rioting. A Justice Department spokesperson said the attorney general’s assertion was based on information provided from state and local law enforcement agencies, but did not detail what that information entailed. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was even more vague, declining to point to any particular ideology in his assessment. His agency has heard that “a number of different groups are involved in these whether it’s Antifa or it’s others, frankly,” he said. The groups appeared to be organized and using tactics that wouldn’t normally happen in peaceful protest, he said, though he didn’t elaborate. While the motives behind the violence was unclear, there was firmer evidence that some of the protesters were coming to the demonstrations from outside the urban centers that have been the epicenter of the demonstrations. In New York City, federal officials were bringing charges against several suspects, including one of two sisters from upstate New York accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail through the back window of a police van in Brooklyn, a law enforcement official said. The initially peaceful demonstrations in New York City over Floyd’s death spiraled into chaos as night fell Friday. Protester confronted police officers, destroying police vehicles and setting fires. In Detroit, 37 of the 60 people who were arrested in overnight protests did not live in the city — and many came from nearby suburbs, police Chief James Craig said today. Although Detroit is about 80% black, many of those arrested were white. “We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,” Craig told reporters. “If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community.” Initially, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said he’d been told all of those arrested in his city Friday were from outside the state. But a spokesman said tonight the mayor had later learned more than half are from Minnesota. In Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, 47 of the 57 people arrested in protest incidents through this morning had provided a Minnesota address to authorities, according to Jeremy Zoss, a spokesman for the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office. Carter expressed the opinion of many black activists in the Twin Cities who have expressed disbelief that local residents would destroy their own neighborhoods, burning down essential services and damaging small businesses. And while it was local protesters and groups that staged initial angry, but peaceful, demonstrations, it was agitators from elsewhere that strategically escalated the tension by causing damage and setting fires, they said. Their beliefs were reinforced by the large numbers of white people in the protests in Minneapolis. “I think about third of the people are from out of town here to make the city burn,” said Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage. “It is just putting black people in a crossfire not just between fascists and anarchists — but putting us in a crossfire with the national guard.” It’s exceedingly difficult in the chaos and dark of the events to prove these claims. The challenge is made harder in the Minnesota protest, where very few arrests were made in the first two nights of unrest. St. Paul arrest records showed 18 people were arrested on charges related to civil unrest from Thursdasy to early this morning. Of those, only four were from outside the state; two were listed as unknown. Still, some civil rights leaders had a clear message for anyone coming to protest, even those who show up to call for justice for Floyd. “The moment has passed. Go home, stay away from here. We are a vulnerable population. At the end of that day if black folks can’t rebuild then the only thing we’ve done is build more power for white folks,” said Terrell. “You’re talking about years, decades of work undone by these groups — and by the officer.” Trump vowed today that the “radical left criminals, thugs and others” would “not be allowed to set communities ablaze.” “I will not allow angry mobs to dominate,” he said. “Won’t happen.”",0.0

In several instances, pepper spray was used to disperse the crowd as pockets of violence erupted. Trump did not talk to reporters as he returned to the White House after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket in Florida. It was not clear if he could hear the protest over the sounds of his helicopter. Earlier Saturday, Trump belittled protesters. In Florida, he pledged to “stop mob violence.” “I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace, and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,"" the president said after watching the launch of a SpaceX rocket. ""Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the missions at hand.” Protesters in Washington chanted and taunted the police. Witnesses said there were multiple incidents of protesters pushing against barricades and being repelled with pepper spray. “We're sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said. “They're wild. There's just been too many dead boys,” she said. The Washington protest was one of several around the country following Floyd's death. During one confrontation, protesters took down a barrier and one person threw an electric scooter at the police An activist wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt put himself between police and the protesters and yelled, “Stop. This is what they want.” Speaking over a megaphone earlier in the evening, Cameron McCall said, “We don’t need violence. All we need are our voices.” While some protesters stayed near the White House, others marched through the streets chanting, “No justice and no peace.” and “Say his name: George Floyd.” The mood was angry and several speakers implored marchers to remain peaceful. At multiple stops along the march, protesters verbally abused lines of uniformed police officers with riot shields. The march paused between the the Washington Monument and the African-American Museum and demonstrators sat down in the street for a moment of silence for each minute that the Minneapolis police officer knelt on Floyd's neck. Floyd, who is black, was being held in handcuffs when he died Monday in Minneapolis after a police officer pressed his knee into his neck for more than eight minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. Protests have erupted in U.S. cities in the days since. At the Lincoln Memorial, one organizer spoke over a megaphone “Look to the left and to the right and thank that person. We can't hug anybody because of COVID but I love you anyway.” Many of the protesters wore masks, but did not socially distance themselves. Another group circled through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for at least an hour in cars, honking. A helicopter hovered overhead. During an earlier skirmish, protesters threw bottles and eggs at Secret Service officers on the edge of Lafayette Square and pepper spray was used to disperse them, according to a reporter for radio station WTOP. “After a long stalemate the Secret Service, in full tactical gear, pushed forward and cleared the intersection, and there was a cloud of pepper spray and people ran backwards as fast as they could. It was almost a mad stampede,” said WTOP digital editor Alejandro Alvarez. In a series of tweets earlier Saturday, Trump doubted their allegiance to Floyd’s memory, saying they were “professionally managed.” He offered no evidence to back his assertion, and the president even seemed to invite supporters to make their presence felt: “Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” Trump later rejected the suggestion that he was stoking a potential conflict between protesters and his supporters. “I was just asking. But I have no idea if they are going to be here,"" he said. “MAGA is Make America Great Again. By the way, they love African American people. They love black people.” At Saturday's demonstration, there was no evidence of a counter-move by Trump supporters. Trump said he had “watched every move” from inside the executive mansion during Friday's protest and “couldn't have felt more safe” as the Secret Service let the protesters carry on, “but whenever someone ... got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on then, hard — didn't know what hit them.” The president also criticized the mayors of Washington and Minneapolis. Trump said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “is probably a very good person, but he’s a radical, left mayor.” He then described how he watched as a police station in the city was overrun. “For that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I’ve never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life,"" Trump said when speaking briefly to reporters at the White House. He said Minnesota officials have to get tougher with rioters, and that by doing so they would be honoring the memory of Floyd. The Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that six protesters were arrested in Washington and “multiple” officers were injured. There were no details on the charges or nature of the injuries. A spokesman for U.S. Park Police said their officers made no arrests, but several suffered minor injuries and one was taken to a hospital after being struck in the helmet by a projectile. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Saturday called the protesters “criminals” who committed “acts of violence while hiding behind their First Amendment right of lawful protest.” Wolf said the Secret Service was “evolving and adapting to the changing nature of the threats they face.” As he tweeted, Trump claimed that many Secret Service agents were “just waiting for action” and ready to unleash “the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen."" His reference to “vicious dogs” potentially being sicced on protesters revisits images from the civil rights movement when marchers faced snarling police dogs and high-pressure fire hoses. In a news conference Saturday afternoon, Muriel Bowser, mayor of the nation’s capital, called Trump’s remark’s “gross” and said the reference to attack dogs conjures up with the worst memories of the nation’s fight against segregation. “I call upon our city and our nation to exercise restraint, great restraint, even as the president tries to divide us,” she said. “I feel like these comments are an attack on humanity, an attack on black America, and they make my city less safe.” In contrast with the president’s tweets, the Secret Service said it “respects the right to assemble and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all.” In protests that stretched into the early hours Saturday, people hurled pieces of bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and Park Police officers who were in riot gear behind barricades around the White House. Protesters at times kicked and punched officers and wrestled over the barricades. As some in the crowd grew more aggressive, police deployed pepper spray to keep them back and maintain a perimeter of officers around the White House. The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering “unlawful” and ordered everyone to leave Lafayette Square, a seven-acre public park located directly north of the White House. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters. “Out of the park or you will be sprayed,” an officer shouted at the crowd.",0.0

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd’s death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The previous day’s protests also started calmly, but many descended into violence later in the day. >> PHOTO GALLERY: Protests continue nationwide — In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of today in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. — In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. — In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah’s governor. What started as a peaceful demonstration later turned destructive, with people flipping a police car and lighting it on fire. A second car was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. — In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. One man used a skateboard to try to break a police SUV’s windshield. A spray-painted police car burned in the street. — And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects, knocking several people to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up protests, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to clear streets outside a police precinct and elsewhere. The show of force came after three days when police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured in more than 4,000 National Guard troops to Minneapolis and said the number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Minneapolis’ streets steadily grew calmer as the night went on, and Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said the tough response would remain as long as it takes to “quell this situation.” Some residents were glad to see the unrest dissipating. “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,” said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong.” Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics tonight, commending the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle and Minneapolis — where thousands had ignored the same order Friday night. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, including over 500 Friday in Los Angeles. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. “Quite frankly I’m ready to just lock people up,” Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters today on blocked-off downtown streets. “Yes, you caught us off balance once. It’s not going to happen twice.” This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Trump stoked the anger on Twitter, saying that if protesters had breached the White House fence, they would “have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.” Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and expressed sympathy for protesters’ concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said.

The rage emanating from Minneapolis has spread to Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and dozens of other cities in a torrent of demands — many made peacefully, some not — for justice over the death of another black man at the hands of police. But that rancor is particularly deep here, where residents complain authorities stood down for too long while looters and rioters ran wild. “They dropped the ball. The moment the police officer did that, they should have called the National Guard in,” said Glen Walton as he grilled hot dogs for hundreds of fellow protesters near the intersection where Floyd, 46, was fatally restrained Monday. “We are in it for the long haul.” Officer Derek Chauvin, 42, was fired a day after Floyd’s death, but he wasn’t charged with murder until Thursday. That night, crowds overran his Third Precinct police station, setting it on fire. On Friday, the largest crowds yet swept through the city, ignoring an 8 p.m. curfew, surrounding another precinct, rioting, looting and burning businesses as a few police and National Guard troops stood watching. >> PHOTO GALLERY: Protests continue nationwide That momentum spread across the country, drawing in President Donald Trump, who derisively tweeted that Minneapolis had to get tougher against demonstrators and anarchists, and from civil rights activists who complained that violence and vandalism were threatening to overshadow the wider intent of most protesters to advocate for civil rights and non-racist policing. Tensions between police and protesters intensified in many cities today, with police in riot gear firing tear gas, and more swiftly moving to stem unrest. The demonstrations played out across a nation already reeling from the coronavirus, with a death toll that passed 100,000 last week, and unemployment numbers not seen since the Great Depression. Those frustrations — although separate — coincided with the anger over viral pictures of a white police officer kneeling on the neck of a black man who was gasping, “I can’t breathe.” Those images caught this city and many others off-guard. Minneapolis authorities “handled it very poorly — which is to be expected,” said the Rev. J. R. Logan of Apostolic Deliverance Temple, who was helping Walton grill hot dogs. Logan said he has tired of watching police act with impunity at the expense of minorities. Protests over the deaths of other black men — most recently Philando Castile and Jamar Clark — didn’t result in convictions. “We sit and hope and continue to see the same thing,” Logan said. But he and others on Minneapolis’ streets today said these protests have been more productive, perhaps worth the cost. There’s been looting and damage to businesses, some minority-owned. But they’ve also drawn a diverse mix of people, including many white supporters of Black Lives Matter. There’s been international attention. Few expressed fear that they would be arrested for breaking curfew today, or that Gov. Tim Walz had deployed the entire state National Guard. Walz and other officials, including one-time presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar, sought to distinguish between civil rights protesters angered by Floyd’s death and those responsible for looting and setting fires that escalated during the past week and appeared to overwhelm a progressive city not prepared to handle such a crisis. “Everything that we believe in, they are trying to destroy,” Walz said at a Saturday briefing with local leaders, insisting that most of the marauders were from out of town. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said rioters were using protesters “as human shields.” “Just by virtue of being part of a crowd that people looking to destroy our communities can hide in, that is aiding these people,” Carter said. The Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, who has been a target of President Trump’s criticism since protests began, likened officials urging residents to stay home to London during the Nazis’ Blitz. “By being out tonight you are most definitely helping those who seek to wrong our city,” he said. But at least 2,000 protesters paid no attention and broke the 8 p.m. curfew, gathering near the Fifth Precinct. Some carried signs. A few carried bats. A young white man wore a V for Vendetta mask usually associated with anarchists. A middle-aged black man in a T-shirt that said “You’re gonna stop killing us” approached the young man in the V mask and three of his friends, castigating them for fomenting chaos that gets blamed on African Americans. “The police station is gone. Stop burning (stuff) down,” said Larry Arman, 46, of St. Paul. The younger man, who declined to give his name, said he was from Minneapolis, as were his friends, who wore ski goggles in anticipation of clashes with police. He said they brought medical supplies. Arman didn’t care. “Nothing’s going to change until people start getting touched, not buildings,” he said, adding that no one was creating havoc in the suburbs. “This is the only place where it looks like the end of the world. Let’s stop making it look like that.” Shortly after, at 8:35 p.m., a line of Minnesota State Patrol officers marched toward protesters and journalists gathered near the Fifth Precinct. Officers told the crowd, “You’re in violation … please disperse.” The journalists, including a Los Angeles Times reporter and photographer, identified themselves as members of the media. Police then advanced and fired tear gas and projectiles at point-blank range into the crowd, hitting a Times reporter in the leg. The Times photographer was having difficulty breathing and could not immediately see. Another journalist was seen with a bloody face. Reporters and protesters scrambled over a brick wall to seek cover. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who was the state’s first Muslim and black congressman, urged protesters to stay home and await further charges against the officers involved in Floyd’s death. Ellison said “evil elements” were trying to “tarnish” the protests by causing mayhem, “so people will say, ‘Oh, those protesters are bad, they’re just out there causing trouble, their cause can’t be just.’” To Kelly Austin, the fearmongering and delayed crackdown seemed tone-deaf, reinforcing the very type of over-policing she and others were protesting. “People are seeing in real time why people are marching,” Austin, 31, said as she visited Floyd’s memorial with her sister earlier today. “It’s just a matter of time before police make another mistake and it’s just going to fuel the fire.” She said officials need to join protesters, visit sites like the memorial and confer with community leaders. “We’re going to keep marching until we see a change,” Austin said. Her sister, Jeanelle Austin, 35, blamed the governor and other officials for telling protesters to stay home so that they could round up rowdy elements infiltrating their ranks, including white supremacists. She said they need to find a way to protect protesters’ rights without inciting fear or leaving them to fend for themselves. “We have to be able to fight for justice without dying in the process,” she said. Hundreds of residents descended on the battered East Lake Street corridor today where buildings were still smoldering to sweep up debris and distribute donated food. They held community meetings in parks, prayer circles on corners and a protest of thousands outside the Fifth Precinct. Erin Lavelle, who volunteered to direct traffic nearby, blamed Frey for being “in over his head.” The mayor doesn’t seem to have learned from the criticism his predecessor drew for her response to the 2015 police shooting of Jamar Clark, Lavelle said, and “now here we are again.” Lavelle, 40, hasn’t really slept since Monday. Tonight, she planned to stay up to guard elderly neighbors after spending the previous night watching cars with out-of-state plates zoom down their street, shooting. “We can’t just hide,” she said. Walz blamed anarchists, white supremacists and others for using protests as cover for theft, looting and arson. But some protesters at the Fifth Precinct disagreed. Artist Austin Boe, 37, said he’s a “peaceful anarchist” outraged by Floyd’s death and police brutality. He said he joined today’s protests because “I’m not pro-cop, so it fits my agenda.” Boe, who said he did not condone looting, said it’s easy for officials to use the word “anarchy” to stir fear, which he felt today when a black protest leader singled him out for his anarchist sign and others booed. He decided to stay anyway and defy curfew because he believes in Black Lives Matter. Dionne Sims, 27, and her friends arrived at the Fifth Precinct with brooms in hand to help clean nearby businesses, and planned to protest later. She called the expected National Guard expansion an “unnecessary escalation” without a clear goal. Protesters, she said, remain focused on pressing prosecutors to charge the other three officers involved in Floyd’s arrest. Already, they have persuaded Minneapolis public schools and the University of Minnesota to drop contracts with the city’s police, more than past protests accomplished. “That would not have happened if people were not in the streets,” she said.",0.0
1621322667,2020-05-31 01:14:12,US Cities Fear Protests May Fuel New Wave Of Virus Outbreaks,https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/us-cities-fear-protests-may-fuel-new-wave-virus-outbreaks,en,False,,332152,hawaiipublicradio.org,http://hawaiipublicradio.org/,"LOS ANGELES — The massive protests sweeping across U.S. cities following the police killing of a black man in Minnesota have sent shudders through the health community and elevated fears that the huge crowds will lead to a new surge in cases of the coronavirus. Some leaders appealing for calm in places where crowds smashed storefronts and destroyed police cars in recent nights have been handing out masks and warning demonstrators they were putting themselves at risk. “If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Saturday evening. “There is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” Minnesota’s governor said too many protesters weren’t socially distancing or wearing masks after heeding the call earlier in the week. But many seemed undeterred. “It’s not OK that in the middle of a pandemic we have to be out here risking our lives,” Spence Ingram said Friday after marching with other protesters to the state Capitol in Atlanta. “But I have to protest for my life and fight for my life all the time.” Ingram, 25, who was wearing a mask, said she has asthma and was worried about contracting the virus. But she said as a black woman, she always felt that her life was under threat from police and she needed to protest that. The demonstrations over the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee into his neck, are coming at a time when many cities were beginning to relax stay-at-home orders. That’s especially worrisome for health experts who fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at gatherings with people packed cheek to jowl and cheering and jeering without masks. “Whether they’re fired up or not that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. Even for the many protesters who have been wearing masks, those don’t guarantee protection from the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cloth masks because they can make it more difficult for infected people to spread the virus — but they are not designed to protect the person wearing the mask from getting it. The U.S. has been worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 1.7 million cases and over 103,000 deaths, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. In New York, where more than 21,000 people have died during the pandemic, a large crowd in Brooklyn tossed water bottles at officers and torched a police van Friday outside the Barclays Center. Officers cleared the crowd by spraying an eye-irritating chemical. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said after another night of unrest in Minneapolis that many protesters wearing masks were simply trying to hide their identities and “cause confusion and take advantage of this situation.” “I will continue to stress, because it seems like a lifetime ago: We are still in the middle of a pandemic and passed 1,000 deaths yesterday. We still have hospitals on the verge of being overrun with COVID-19,” he said. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey echoed those concerns: “We have two crises that are sandwiched on top of one other."" The state’s health commissioner had warned just days earlier that the massive protests were almost certain to fuel new cases of the virus. Minnesota reported 35 deaths on Thursday, a single-day high since the start of the outbreak, and 29 more on Friday. But it wasn’t just protesters at risk — unmasked officers stood within arm’s reach of shouting demonstrators. In Atlanta, police Chief Erika Shields waded into a crowd without a mask Friday while she listened to people air frustrations. When Los Angeles officials announced earlier in the week that the city was relaxing stay-at-home orders and reopening stores, they said political protests could resume but with a cap of 100 people. Several hundred people showed up for a protest organized by Black Lives Matter-LA and later shut down a freeway. Most wore masks, but many did not observe a buffer zone. Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Friday that was an ongoing concern. “Show respect for each other by putting on that face covering so that your respiratory droplets aren’t unintentionally getting into somebody else’s mouth, nose or eyes,” she said. Those same concerns surfaced Saturday in Paris when unions flouted a ban on large gatherings at a march to protest conditions for workers in the country illegally. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and said they had banned the march due to the “health risks that such an event is likely to generate.” Meanwhile, the European Union on Saturday urged President Donald Trump to rethink his decision to terminate the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization as spiking infection rates in India and elsewhere reinforced that the pandemic is far from contained. Trump on Friday charged that the WHO didn’t respond adequately to the pandemic and accused the U.N. agency of being under China’s “total control.” The U.S. is the largest source of financial support for the WHO, and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organization. The head of the EU’s executive arm urged Trump to reconsider. “The WHO needs to continue being able to lead the international response to pandemics, current and future,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Germany’s Funke media group that Trump’s decision was the “wrong signal at the wrong time.” In China, where the virus outbreak began, only four new confirmed cases were reported Saturday, all brought from outside the country. More than 6 million coronavirus infections have been reported worldwide, with over 368,000 deaths and more than 2.5 million recoveries, according to the Johns Hopkins tally. The true death toll is widely believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of the virus without ever being tested for it. Elite sporting events will be allowed to resume in England starting Monday, but without spectators, paving the way for the planned June 17 return of the Premier League, the world’s richest soccer competition. England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned that the situation overall remained precarious. “I believe this is also a very dangerous moment,” he said. “We have to get this right.” India registered another record single-day jump of 7,964 cases and 265 deaths. The government had been expected to end a 2-month-old nationwide lockdown but instead extended measures in some areas due to coronavirus outbreaks. Italy, though, added 111 new victims to its death toll and nearly 420 new infections, in line with its recent daily tallies, suggesting the virus is under control nearly four weeks after the country began gingerly loosening a strict lockdown in the onetime European epicenter of the pandemic.",0.0
1621351925,2020-05-31 03:35:00,National Guard called in to quell violence in Los Angeles,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/05/30/breaking-news/national-guard-called-in-to-quell-violence-in-los-angeles/,en,False,,39573,HonululuAdvertiser,http://www.staradvertiser.com/,"LOS ANGELES >> The Los Angeles mayor said National Guard troops were being sent in to the nation’s second-largest city after a fourth day of violent protests today saw demonstrators clash repeatedly with officers, torch police vehicles and pillage businesses. Mayor Eric Garcetti said he asked Gov. Gavin Newsom for 500 to 700 members of the Guard to assist the 10,000 Los Angeles Police Department officers. “The California National Guard is being deployed to Los Angeles overnight to support our local response to maintain peace and safety on the streets of our city,” said the mayor, who ordered a rare citywide curfew until Sunday morning. Firefighters responded to dozens of fires, and scores of businesses were damaged. One of the hardest-hit areas was the area around the Grove, a popular high-end outdoor mall west of downtown where hundreds of protesters swarmed the area, showering police with rocks and other objects and vandalizing shops. Community leaders denounced the violence that has accompanied protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn said she lived through two previous seminal LA race riots — Watts in 1965 and 1992 following the acquittal of police officers in the beating of black motorist Rodney King — and remembers the pain the city endured. “We must stand in solidarity against the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of law enforcement,” she said. “But please don’t destroy our beloved Los Angeles. This is not a protest anymore.” There were protests in cities throughout California, from San Diego to San Francisco. In Emeryville, just east of San Francisco, Mayor Christian Patz said Target, Best Buy and other box stores were burglarized, with thieves stealing electronics and other items. Stores in the city closed early today as part of a shelter-in-place order following violent protests in nearby Oakland the night before. “It’s an explosion of the frustration of the people in the community,” Patz said, “If we’re going to ask people to stay within the bounds of the law, we’re going to have to show that the law applies to everyone.” In San Francisco multiple stores on Market Street were damaged, and a fire was set at Westfield Mall. Authorities said there was increased violence, vandalism and assaults on officers. San Francisco Mayor London Breed said a citywide curfew will go into effect from 8 p.m. Sunday to 5 a.m. Monday. She has also asked the governor to put the California National Guard on standby. San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said he understood why protesters are angry at police. But he warned that if anyone assaulted officers “we will not tolerate that.” In Santa Ana, south of Los Angeles, people threw fireworks and explosives at police. The scale of the damage in Los Angeles was being compared to the 1992 riots, when there was more than $1 billion in property damage. There was no estimate of how many businesses suffered damage since protests began Wednesday, but it was clearly extensive. The day’s clashes occurred in and near the Fairfax District, where the historic center of LA’s Jewish community mixes with upscale shopping, restaurants and entertainment industry sites that draw locals and tourists from around the world. CBS Television City, the quaint Original Farmer’s Market and the high-end luxury of the Grove are among sights. Trendy Melrose Avenue, which lent its name to the TV show “Melrose Place,” runs through the neighborhood. The rally that preceded the violence was held at Pan-Pacific Park, former site of the 1930s-era Pan-Pacific Auditorium where LA’s professional sports teams played and many of its major events were held before the city’s modern arenas were built. Through the day, crowds of demonstrators faced off with lines of police officers, or broke into businesses and stole merchandise. Patrol cars were battered and set ablaze, and several businesses burned into the night. The huge crowds gradually dissipated, but officers still pursued scattered groups and individuals. On Friday night, protesters rampaged through the downtown late at night, smashing windows and robbing jewelry and other stores. Police arrested 533 people. Today, a mostly peaceful demonstration early in the day devolved in the afternoon when protesters set several Police Department cars on fire, broke store windows and climbed on top of a bus. Police used batons to move protesters back and shot rubber bullets to scatter the crowd. The demonstration came hours after LAPD Chief Michel Moore appealed for peaceful protest. “I am asking for all of Los Angeles to come together and find the ability to peacefully express individual and collective grievances while also maintaining the safety of all of Angelenos,” he said. Garcetti initially imposed a curfew on the downtown area. But he quickly expanded it to the entirety of the city as the violence focused on an area about 6 miles (9.6 kilometers) to the west. Everyone was ordered to be off the streets from 8 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. Adjacent Beverly Hills and West Hollywood followed as demonstrations spread into those cities. Other cities in the county also began imposing curfews. “We cannot allow this city to spiral into anarchy,” Moore told ABC7 at the scene of one clash. Social media video posts showed marchers chanting “Eat the rich” in Beverly Hills, where a crowd broke into a high-end boutique and fled with merchandise. The governor said earlier that authorities were closely monitoring organizing by violent extremist groups who may be trying to use the protests for their own agendas. “To those who seek to exploit Californians’ pain to sow chaos and destruction, you are not welcome,” he said. “Our state and nation must build from this moment united and more resolved than ever to address racism and its root causes.” In Oakland, 13 officers were injured late Friday as demonstrators hurled objects at them. A federal contract security officer was killed and another critically injured when a vehicle pulled up to the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building and someone opened fire. The officers guard the U.S. courthouse as part of their regular duties and were monitoring the protest, Department of Homeland Security officials said. It wasn’t immediately known whether the shooter had anything to do with the protest. The death of the 46-year-old Floyd, who was recorded on video pleading for air as a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee on his neck, has shocked the country and produced violence in numerous citie s. Police chiefs and police unions have called it unjustifiable and excessive force. The officer has been charged with murder. In the San Francisco Bay Area, protests in Oakland and San Jose grew increasingly tense and confrontational Friday night. Small fires were set inside a Walgreens and a Mercedes-Benz dealership on Oakland’s auto row, where several cars were smashed and spray-painted with graffiti. City officials said more than 70 businesses were vandalized. “This is not who we are,” Mayor Libby Schaaf said in a videotaped statement today. “We must fight the travesty of racism, but we must do it in a way that works. Let’s not destroy or harm our own community.” In San Jose, a Santa Clara County Sheriff’s deputy fired at an SUV that attempted to drive through a group of protesters, striking two of them while attempting to make a U-turn, the East Bay Times reported. Police in both cities fired tear gas and flash-bang grenades to break up unruly crowds. Oakland police said in a preliminary report that at least 18 people were arrested and another 60 detained for investigation of stealing. In Sacramento, nine police officers sustained minor injuries at a protest that drew about 500 people.",0.0

The peaceful demonstration, which began at 10 a.m., included a line of individuals holding signs and chanting “I can’t breathe,” as passing motorists honked horns. The rally comes on the heels of the May 25th death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the ongoing protests that have followed. The officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck during the incident has since been charged with murder according The New York Times. SPONSORED VIDEO Messaging on signs at the Maui rally included: “Demand justice for all victims of police violence,” “One Race Human Race,” “Justice for George Floyd,” “Justice for All,” “Black Lives Matter,” “I stand against injustice. I stand for the unheard,” “Murder is worse than rioting,” “It is not enough to be non-racist; we must be anti-racist,” “Know Justice, Know Peace,” “We all bleed the same color,” and “Silence = Violence.” Participants called the demonstration peaceful, and an opportunity to stand in unity, “regardless of race, ethnicity, age or socioeconomic status.” On Sunday afternoon, Maui Mayor Michael Victorino released the following statement: “Peaceful protests are a First Amendment birthright of every American. On Maui, it’s encouraging that protests of Mr. George Floyd’s death have been peaceful. I support our citizens’ right to express their grievances and share information and concerns in pursuit of a better, more just world. We all have the right to agree or disagree, but I ask everyone to do so peacefully, with dignity and respect for each other. “Joycelyn and I extend our sincere condolences to the Floyd family, and pray that they will find peace and closure when justice is served.” *Video courtesy: Mia Minkler",0.0

NASA’s Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode skyward aboard a white-and-black, bullet-shaped Dragon capsule on top of a Falcon 9 rocket, lifting off at 3:22 p.m. from the same launch pad used to send Apollo crews to the moon a half-century ago. Minutes later, they slipped safely into orbit. ADVERTISING “Let’s light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the historic words used by Alan Shepard on America’s first human spaceflight, in 1961. The two men are scheduled to arrive today at the International Space Station, 250 miles above Earth, for a stay of up to four months, after which they will come home with a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea, something the world hasn’t witnessed since the 1970s. The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the case of George Floyd, the handcuffed black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others expressed hope the flight would lift American spirits and show the world what the U.S. can do. “We are back in the game. It’s very satisfying,” said Doug Marshburn, of Deltona, Florida, who shouted, “USA! USA!” as he watched the 260-foot rocket climb skyward. SpaceX becomes the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China. “This is something that should really get people right in the heart of anyone who has any spirit of exploration,” Musk, the visionary also behind the Tesla electric car company, said after liftoff, pounding his chest with his fist. The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station. ADVERTISING Over the past few years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021. NASA plans to rely in part on commercial partners as it pursues it next goals: sending astronauts back to the moon within a few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s. At a post-liftoff rally held at NASA’s massive 525-foot-high Vehicle Assembly Building, President Donald Trump commended Musk and proclaimed: “Today we once again proudly launch American astronauts on American rockets, the best in the world, from right here on American soil.”",0.0

Some leaders appealing for calm in places where crowds smashed storefronts and destroyed police cars in recent nights have been handing out masks and warning demonstrators they were putting themselves at risk. ADVERTISING “If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Saturday evening. “There is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” Minnesota’s governor said too many protesters weren’t socially distancing or wearing masks after heeding the call earlier in the week. But many seemed undeterred. “It’s not OK that in the middle of a pandemic we have to be out here risking our lives,” Spence Ingram said Friday after marching with other protesters to the state Capitol in Atlanta. “But I have to protest for my life and fight for my life all the time.” Ingram, 25, who was wearing a mask, said she has asthma and was worried about contracting the virus. But she said as a black woman, she always felt that her life was under threat from police and she needed to protest that. The demonstrations over the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee into his neck, are coming at a time when many cities were beginning to relax stay-at-home orders. ADVERTISING That’s especially worrisome for health experts who fear that silent carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at gatherings with people packed cheek to jowl. “Whether they’re fired up or not that doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis.",0.0

The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd’s death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. ADVERTISING Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The previous day’s protests also started calmly, but many descended into violence later in the day. • In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds taunted law enforcement officers. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. • In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. • In Salt Lake City, protesters defied a curfew and National Guard troops were deployed by Utah’s governor. What started as a peaceful demonstration later turned destructive, with people flipping a police car and lighting it on fire. A second car was later set ablaze. Police said six people were arrested and a police officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. • In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. One man used a skateboard to try to break a police SUV’s windshield. A spray-painted police car burned in the street. • And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects, knocking several people to the ground. ADVERTISING It was unclear if anyone was hurt. “Our country has a sickness.

Tens of thousands marched peacefully to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. But many demonstrations sank into chaos as night fell: Cars and businesses were torched. The words “I can’t breathe” were spray-painted all over buildings. The damaged buildings include many near the White House. The scale of the protests, extending to nearly every part of the country and unfolding on a single night, seemed to rival the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam eras. And by Sunday morning, the outrage had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square. Despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrators clapped and waved placards as they offered support to U.S. demonstrators. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington, D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” People set fire to squad cars, threw bottles at officers and busted windows of storefronts. They carried away TVs and other items even as some protesters urged them to stop. In Indianapolis, multiple shootings were reported, including one that left a person dead amid the protests, adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up the demonstrations. President Donald Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics Saturday night, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and saying police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a late-night statement. On Sunday, maintenance crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been completely shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump and anti-police sentiments. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. Cleanup soon began in cities across the country. In Madison, Wisconsin, hundreds of volunteers gathered to pick up after the violence that included setting a police squad car on fire, stealing from businesses and breaking windows at dozens of stores and an art museum. Few corners of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia , and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to Athens, Savannah and any other cities where more demonstrations were planned Sunday. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. “The protesters need to know we’re going to support their efforts in a peaceful, nonviolent protest,” the Republican told television station WSB late Saturday. “The agitators need to know that we’ll be there ... to take them to jail if they’re destroying lives and property.” In Virginia’s capital city, graffiti invoking Floyd or directing slurs at the police dotted downtown, including many of Richmond's some prominent Confederate monuments. At the headquarters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which news outlets reported was vandalized and set ablaze, a few men with long guns were among a small crowd gathered outside. One man said they were there to protect the building. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, six officers were hurt after being hit with rocks and fireworks. Police have arrested nearly 1,700 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. But not all protests were marred by violence. In Juneau, Alaska, local police joined protesters at a rally in front of a giant whale sculpture on the city’s waterfront. “We don’t tolerate excessive use of force,” Juneau Police Chief Ed Mercer told a gathering where most people wore masks and some sang Alaska Native songs. The show of force in Minneapolis came after three days in which police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured more than 4,000 National Guard troops into Minneapolis. Authorities said that number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who also said local forces had been overmatched the previous day. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Some residents were glad to see the upheaval dissipating. “l live here. I haven’t been able to sleep,” said Iman Muhammad, whose neighborhood saw multiple fires set Friday night. Muhammad said she sympathized with peaceful protests over Floyd’s death but disagreed with the violence: “Wrong doesn’t answer wrong.”",0.0

The first attempt to launch the rocket, on Wednesday, was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather threatened another postponement for most of the day, but the skies began to clear just in the time. The astronauts set out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV after Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife. Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket’s first-stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast, to be reused on another flight. “Thanks for the great ride to space,” Hurley told SpaceX ground control. The two crewmates batted around a floating blue dinosaur plush toy doubling as a dragon, demonstrating that they had reached zero gravity. SpaceX controllers at Hawthorne, California, cheered and applauded wildly, and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine declared: “This is everything that America has to offer in its purest form.” Attendance inside Kennedy Space Center was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the crowd amounted to only a few thousand. By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online. Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators flocked to beaches and roads, some of them not wearing masks or keeping 6 feet from others. Among the spectators was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York. “With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” he said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.” Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Because of the coronavirus, the astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And the SpaceX controllers had masks and were seated far apart. In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens. Once settled in orbit, Hurley disclosed that the capsule has been christened Endeavour, a storied name in the history of exploration, also given to one of the space shuttles. SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. Under the new corporate-public model, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.) Saturday’s mission is technically considered a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese. The first flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But the project encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks. A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. And Boeing’s first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and was nearly destroyed during a test flight in December. For SpaceX and the future of public-corporate space exploration, the stakes on Saturday were extraordinarily high. With the spaceship finally on its way, Musk got choked up talking about the weight of his responsibility for the astronauts’ lives and their families and noted that the return to Earth is more dangerous in some ways than ascent, “so we don’t want to declare victory yet.” Still, Musk said he wasn’t nervous about the launch on Saturday the way he was during the previous attempt. “Today, I don’t know, it felt like just the fates were aligned,” he said. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Mike Schneider in Cape Canaveral, Fla., contributed to this report.

1621658535,2020-05-31 06:05:00,Protests over police killings rage in dozens of US cities,https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2020/05/31/nation-world-news/protests-over-police-killings-rage-in-dozens-of-us-cities/,en,False,,225040,westhawaiitoday.com,http://westhawaiitoday.com/,"MINNEAPOLIS — Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country convulsed through another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns. The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd’s death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands. ADVERTISING Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy. After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The previous day’s protests also started calmly, but many descended into violence later in the day. — In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds were taunting Secret Service agents. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists. — In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown. — In the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016. — In Seattle, police fired tear gas and stun grenades to try to disperse black-clad crowds that smashed downtown shopfronts, stole merchandise and tossed mannequins onto the street. — In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. One man used a skateboard to try to break a police SUV’s windshield. A spray-painted police car burned in the street. — And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects, knocking several people to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. “Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.” Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, 29-year-old Sam Allkija said the damage seen in recent days reflects longstanding frustration and rage in the black community. “I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who said local forces had been overmatched Friday, fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force. The Guard announced Saturday it had more than 4,000 members responding to Minneapolis and would quickly have nearly 11,000. “The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.” Soon after the city’s 8 p.m. curfew went into force, lines of police cars and officers in riot gear moved in to confront protesters, firing tear gas to push away throngs of people milling around the city’s 5th police precinct station. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not forcefully enough confronting days of violent and damaging protests that included protesters burning down a police station shortly after officers abandoned it. Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement Saturday night. He commended the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and also said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, ranging from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People were also told to be off the streets of Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle and Minneapolis — where thousands had ignored the same order Friday night. More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday. The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months. “Quite frankly I’m ready to just lock people up,” Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. “Yes, you caught us off balance once. It’s not going to happen twice.” This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion. Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people. The officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved. Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd’s killing and expressed sympathy for protesters’ concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics. Minnesota has steadily increased to 1,700 the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and the governor is considering a potential offer of military police put on alert by the Pentagon. Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, Cincinnati and elsewhere. Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV. ADVERTISING ___ Numerous AP journalists contributed from across the U.S.",0.0

ADVERTISING Overall, the cost of food bought to eat at home skyrocketed by the most in 46 years, and analysts caution that meat prices in particular could remain high as slaughterhouses struggle to maintain production levels while implementing procedures intended to keep workers healthy. While price spikes for staples such as eggs and flour have eased as consumer demand has leveled off, prices remain volatile for carrots, potatoes and other produce because of transportation issues and the health of workers who pick crops and work in processing plants. In short, supermarket customers and restaurant owners shouldn’t expect prices to drop anytime soon. “Our biggest concern is long-term food costs. I believe they will continue to go up,” said Julie Kalambokidis, co-owner of Adriano’s Brick Oven, a restaurant in Glenwood, Iowa. Trump postpones G7 meeting, seeks expansion of members ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he will postpone until the fall a meeting of Group of 7 nations he had planned to hold next month at the White House despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. And he said he plans to invite Russia, Australia, South Korea and India as he again advocated for the group’s expansion. Trump told reporters on Air Force One as he returned to Washington from Florida that he feels the current makeup of the group is “very outdated” and doesn’t properly represent “what’s going on in the world.” He said he had not yet set a new date for the meeting, but thought the gathering could take place in September, around the time of the annual meeting of the United Nations in New York, or perhaps after the U.S. election in November. Alyssa Farah, White House director of strategic communications, said that Trump wanted to bring in some of the country’s traditional allies and those impacted by the coronavirus to discuss the future of China. The surprise announcement came after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office said Saturday that she would not attend the meeting unless the course of the coronavirus spread had changed by then. US cities fear protests may fuel new wave of virus outbreaks LOS ANGELES — The massive protests sweeping across U.S. cities following the police killing of a black man in Minnesota have sent shudders through the health community and elevated fears that the huge crowds will lead to a new surge in cases of the coronavirus. Some leaders appealing for calm in places where crowds smashed storefronts and destroyed police cars in recent nights have been handing out masks and warning demonstrators they were putting themselves at risk. “If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Saturday evening. “There is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers.” Minnesota’s governor said too many protesters weren’t socially distancing or wearing masks after heeding the call earlier in the week. From wire sources But many seemed undeterred. US faith leaders wrestle twin traumas in protests, virus NEW YORK — American religious leaders across faiths are grappling with the heavy burden of helping to heal two active traumas: rising civil unrest driven by the police killing of George Floyd and the coronavirus pandemic. Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders have raised their voices to condemn racial bias in the justice system while discouraging violence in response to the killing of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck. Those words of solidarity, for many clergy, came as their worship routines remained upended by a virus that has forced them to rely on digital or outdoor gathering. At Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Minneapolis, which has provided relief and medical help to demonstrators this week as protests roiled the city, associate pastor Angela T. Khabeb said the shared pain caused by Floyd’s death was exposing the brutal double toll being exacted on people of color. ADVERTISING “There were other pandemics we didn’t always talk about that faced black communities, indigenous, Latinx” before the virus outbreak, Khabeb said, citing “institutionalized racism” and poverty. “And then we layer on COVID-19, which disproportionately affects black, indigenous, Latinx communities.” Khabeb acknowledged that she felt challenged by the task of tending to her congregation during the current crisis when the latest police killing of a black American had caused “a crisis of my own that’s very personal.”",0.0

The chaos reached into every corner of the country, and the scars extended even to buildings near the White House. Some elected officials prepared to deploy additional National Guard troops in anticipation of more turmoil. Tens of thousands of people marched peacefully to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. But many demonstrations sank into violence as night fell: Cars and stores were torched. The words “I can’t breathe” were spray-painted all over buildings. Police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. The scale of the protests, including nearly every part of the country and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam eras. And by Sunday morning, the fury had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We’re sick of it. The cops are out of control,” protester Olga Hall said in Washington, D.C. “They’re wild. There’s just been too many dead boys.” People set fire to squad cars, threw bottles at officers and broke storefront windows. They carried away TVs and other merchandise even as some protesters urged them to stop. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead after multiple shootings that happened during downtown violence. Those slayings added to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, police, state troopers and National Guard members moved in soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect to break up the demonstrations. The show of force came after three days in which police largely avoided engaging protesters, and after the state poured more than 4,000 National Guard troops into Minneapolis. Authorities said that number would soon rise to nearly 11,000. President Donald Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics, commending the National Guard deployment in Minneapolis and declaring “No games!” He said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!” Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden condemned the violence as he continued to express common cause with those demonstrating after Floyd’s death. “The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest,” Biden said in a late-night statement. Today, maintenance crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump and anti-police sentiments. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. County Commissioner Angela Conley showed up shortly after the curfew lifted, saying that police had trampled flowers and photos of Floyd. “The community needs healing, and what happened last night only exacerbated the pain that’s been felt,” she said of police action. Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who put his knee on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. “We’ll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,” Conley said. Meanwhile, a church located at the intersection set up chairs for an outdoor service. Tracy Gordon, of the Worldwide Outreach for Christ, said it was important “to bring some hope to the community and let everyone know that God is in control.” Few parts of America were untouched, from protesters setting fires inside Reno’s city hall, to police launching tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, including Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Seattle. At least 13 police officers were injured in Philadelphia, and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. In New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. Some leaders prepared to put more soldiers in the streets by evening. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to Athens, Savannah and any other cities where more demonstrations were planned. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. “The protesters need to know we’re going to support their efforts in a peaceful, nonviolent protest,” the Republican told television station WSB late Saturday. “The agitators need to know that we’ll be there … to take them to jail if they’re destroying lives and property.” In Virginia’s capital city, graffiti invoking Floyd or directing slurs at the police dotted downtown, including many of Richmond’s some prominent Confederate monuments. At the headquarters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which news outlets reported was vandalized and set ablaze, a few men with long guns were among a small crowd gathered outside. One man said they were there to protect the building. In Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown Jr. was shot and killed by a white police officer in 2014, sparking a wave of protests throughout the country, six officers were hurt after being hit with rocks and fireworks. Police have arrested nearly 1,700 people in 22 cities since Thursday, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Nearly a third of those arrests came in Los Angeles, where the governor declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to back up the city’s 10,000 police officers as dozens of fires burned across the city. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.",0.0

Mayor Bill de Blasio said today that city police showed “tremendous restraint overall,” but he said was concerned about video showing two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators on a Brooklyn street. He was appointing two city officials to conduct an independent review of how the protests unfolded and how they were handled by the police. “We all better get back to the humanity here,” de Blasio said at a briefing. “The protesters are human beings. They need to be treated with tremendous respect. The police officers are human beings. They need to be treated with tremendous respect.” The largely peaceful protests around the city Saturday gave way to scattered clashes between police and protesters later in the evening Demonstrators smashed shop windows, threw objects at officers, torched and battered police vehicles and blocked roads. New York City police said 345 people were arrested, 33 officers were injured and 27 police vehicles were damaged. There were no major injuries reported. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said some peaceful demonstrations were “hijacked” by a small number of people with violent intent. With more protests scheduled today, Shea said his officers will work with demonstrators. “We’re going to make sure that everyone has the right to peacefully protest and assemble,” Shea said said at a briefing with the mayor. “But we are not going to tolerate destruction of property, having our officers put into harm’s way or any civilians put into harm’s way. Similar protests flared around the nation in response to the Minnesota death of George Floyd. Floyd, who was black, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck until he stopped breathing. Cleanup was under way this morning in New York City, which is still under a lockdown enacted two months ago when it became the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. On the Brooklyn block where two police cruisers lurched into a crowd of demonstrators Saturday, knocking several to the ground, the only sign of the previous night’s disturbance was a small pile of glass shards in the street. Workers power washed the sidewalk and cleaned up graffiti outside the Barclays Center, the site of two nights of demonstrations. In another Brooklyn neighborhood, the burnt remains of a police van torched by protesters were removed. Soot and broken glass was all that remained. The independent review ordered by de Blasio will be conducted by New York city Corporation Counsel James Johnson, who is the city’s chief lawyer, and Margaret Garnett, commissioner of the Department of Investigation, which typically investigates suspected wrongdoing and fraud by city employees.",0.0
1621712062,2020-05-31 12:20:00,World alarmed by violence in U.S. as thousands march in London,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/05/31/breaking-news/world-alarmed-by-violence-in-u-s-as-thousands-march-in-london/,en,False,,39573,HonululuAdvertiser,http://www.staradvertiser.com/,"LONDON >> Nations around the world have watched in horror at the five days of civil unrest in the United States following the death of a black man being detained by police. But they have not been surprised. Racism-tinged events no longer startle even America’s closest allies, though many have watched coverage of the often-violent protests with growing unease. Burning cars and riot police in the U.S. featured on newspaper front pages around the globe today — bumping news of the COVID-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places. Floyd’s death on May 25 in Minneapolis was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in the U.S. Thousands gathered in central London today to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting “No justice! No peace!” and waving placards with the words “How many more?” at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn’t stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred milled around in the street and waved placards. Protesters in Denmark also converged on the U.S. Embassy on today. Participants carried placards with messages such as “Stop Killing Black People.” The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday under the motto: “Justice for George Floyd.” Several hundred more people took to the streets today in the capital’s Kreuzberg area, carrying signs with slogans like “Silence is Violence,” “Hold Cops Accountable,” and “Who Do You Call When Police Murder?” No incidents were reported. Germany’s top-selling Bild newspaper today carried the sensational headline “This killer-cop set America ablaze” with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The newspaper’s story reported “scenes like out of a civil war.” In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper’s senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd’s killing was “different” than previous cases of black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence. “There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,” Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor’s warning that “anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.” In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials’ criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China’s crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: “I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?” Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America’s racial unrest by tweeting “I can’t breathe,” which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed “a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters.” Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of “setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,” without offering any evidence. Russia accused the United States of “systemic problems in the human rights sphere.” It denounced Floyd’s death as the latest in a series of police violence cases against African Americans. “This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.” There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. In Brazil, hundreds of people gathered in front of the Rio de Janeiro state government palace to protest crimes committed by the police against black people in Rio’s working-class neighborhoods, known as favelas. The protest, called “Black lives matter,” was interrupted when police used tear gas to disperse people. “I can’t breathe”, said some of the demonstrators, alluding to the George Floyd´s death. Protesters called for an end to police operations inside favelas. In Canada, an anti-racism protest degenerated into clashes between Montreal police and some demonstrators. About three hours after a march that snaked its way through downtown Montreal had ended, police declared the gathering illegal after they say projectiles were thrown at officers who responded with pepper spray and tear gas. Some windows were smashed and some fires were set. Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to U.S. protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts. That’s a play on the slogan for Lebanon’s protest movement — Lebanon revolts — which erupted on Oct. 17 last year. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #Americanrevolts became the No. 1 trending tag in Lebanon. In another expression of solidarity with American protesters, about 150 people marched through central Jerusalem on Saturday to protest the shooting death by Israeli police of an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man earlier in the day. Israeli police mistakenly suspected that the man, Iyad Halak, was carrying a weapon. When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire.",0.0

Jay Inslee late today ordered a statewide activation of the National Guard following vandalism and thefts in stores and shopping malls in multiple cities following protests over the killing of George Floyd. And police in Portland, Oregon, deployed incendiary devices to disperse a large crowd in downtown late tonight after authorities said projectiles — including aerial mortars — were thrown at officers. Inslee had previously authorized 400 troops for Seattle and 200 troops for Bellevue. On Saturday night, people smashed downtown Seattle storefronts and stole items from many businesses, tossing mannequins into the street. Today, there were thefts in stores and shopping malls in Bellevue, Spokane, Tukwila and Renton. Inslee’s activation means more troops will be used to help control unrest. “We must not let these illegal and dangerous actions detract from the anger so many feel at the deep injustice laid so ugly and bare by the death of George Floyd,” Inslee said in a statement. “But we also will not turn away from our responsibility to protect the residents of our state.” Interstate 5 through downtown Seattle was closed this afternoon because of protest activity, the second day in arrow the main north-south freeway on the West Coast was shut down, and there was also widespread stealing in Bellevue, Washington. Portland also again saw large rallies, and police used tear gas to disperse crowds. Later tonight hundreds of people gathered outside the Multnomah County Justice Center in downtown. Police said protesters smashed windows at the federal courthouse and through loudspeakers authorities declared the late-night gathering a civil disturbance. Bellevue’s mayor declared an emergency this evening because of the violence and said she was enacting a 5:30 p.m. curfew for the downtown area of the city east of Seattle. Gov. Jay Inslee said late today he was sending 200 National Guard troops to Bellevue. Bellevue Police said dozens of people broke into Bellevue Square, a large shopping mall. Officers entered the facility and chased people out. Mayor Lynne Robinson said people were stealing merchandise from storefronts and that help was requested from other police agencies. Earlier, the Washington State Patrol said it was sending units to help quell the unrest there. Bellevue Police Chief Steve Mylett said at an evening news conference that authorities learned earlier that a criminal gang planned activity in the city this afternoon. He said there was widespread stealing and assaults, and the criminal element “swelled very quickly.” “”They were there to destroy,” chief said. “We welcome peaceful protest … this is something different.” Mylett said he was disgusted at what happened to Floyd, who was killed when a Minneapolis officer knelt on his neck, but that violence overshadows legitimate protests. Later tonight, police in Tukwila, Washington, said there were thefts at several stores around Southcenter Mall. Police fired tear gas and made several arrests. Stealing was also reported in nearby Renton, Washington. Washington State Patrol spokesman Rick Johnson said I-5 was closed for safety reasons, and all Interstate 405 ramps to downtown Bellevue were closed as well because of the mayhem there. I-5 in Seattle was reopened tonight. Hundreds of people gathered to rally today in downtown Seattle following unrest Saturday night that saw storefronts smashed and thefts. The first few hours of the Sunday demonstration were peaceful with the group taking a knee every so often in silence and chanting “Say his name, George Floyd.” People along nearby streets cleaned and boarded up windows while law enforcement officers on all corners observed. Dallas Dala, a black man who moved to Seattle from the Congo in 2008, said today that he had been at the protests to support and talk with people. “For me it was about every life matters no matter what, white, black yellow or red. I love everybody,” he said. However several people were later arrested, and police deployed incendiary devices to control the crowd. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan again imposed a 5 p.m. curfew for all of Seattle. At a Sunday evening news conference, Durkan said thousands of people have protested peacefully in the city over the weekend. But those who cause mayhem don’t honor concerns about racism and Floyd’s death and “came to, number one, purposely create violence and destruction,” she said. Inslee dispatched an additional 200 National Guard troops to Seattle to help maintain order after protests turned chaotic, with rioters smashing up storefronts and stealing clothes and other items from downtown shops. Inslee’s order means that up to to 400 National Guard personnel will be available to assist. Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said of today’s 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew: “We fully intend to enforce that curfew in the city.” However hundreds of mostly peaceful demonstrators marched between downtown and the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood. The mayor of Portland, Oregon, also imposed a Sunday curfew for 8 p.m. Portland, too, saw widespread mayhem Friday and Saturday. Other Northwest cities with Sunday curfews included Eugene and Salem in Oregon. There were protests and rallies in other Northwest cities today. In Spokane, hundreds marched through downtown carrying signs that said “Black Lives Matter” and chanting “no justice, no peace.” Later in the evening, police used tear gas to move crowds away from downtown stores after reports of thefts. Police in Seattle arrested at least 27 people Saturday on charges like assault and theft, while Portland police arrested 48 people after downtown storefronts were vandalized and fires were set overnight Saturday.This morning, hundreds of people of all ages turned out in downtown Seattle to help clean up the destruction, sweeping up broken glass and cleaning off graffiti. Durkan and Best walked through the area and spoke with business owners. “I visited downtown this morning. It wasn’t a downtown I recognized,” Durkan said today. “But what I did recognize were the hundreds of volunteers and residents who came because they love Seattle.” In Seattle, Durkan announced her curfew for Saturday and today after rioters torched police vehicles and spilled onto I-5, forcing the freeway’s temporary closure through the central part of the city. Thousands of people gathered in downtown Seattle in the rain to protest the killing of Floyd, a black man who died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death has prompted protests across the U.S. and Europe. A largely peaceful demonstration happened in Seattle on Saturday afternoon, while police later deployed flash bang grenades to disperse people they said had begun throw rocks and bottles at officers. Police also pepper-sprayed demonstrators who got close to police lines, and officers with bicycles pushed people to move back. News footage showed at least one destroyed police cruiser, other vehicle fires and people breaking into retail stores and other businesses. Video shot by a journalist from the Seattle news website Crosscut showed police arriving as storefronts were being smashed and broken into. As one officer restrained a person being arrested, the video showed the officer putting his knee on the man’s neck and the crowd yells for him to remove it. The video then shows a second officer pulling the knee off the neck and onto the detained man’s back.",0.0
1621727774,2020-05-31 15:03:00,Trump Lays Blame For Clashes On 'Radical-Left Anarchists',https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/trump-lays-blame-clashes-radical-left-anarchists,en,False,,332152,hawaiipublicradio.org,http://hawaiipublicradio.org/,"As overlapping crises convulsed an anxious nation, President Trump on Sunday sought to cast blame for widespread protests gripping cities on ""radical-left anarchists,"" while also adding that the media ""is doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy."" The president has said that members of the loosely defined far-left group Antifa — short for ""anti-fascists"" — have led clashes with police and looting in cities across the country since the killing of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis. It's unclear if any group or groups are primarily responsible for escalating protests that began following George Floyd's death on May 25 as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has told the press he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence. In one tweet Sunday, Trump said the United States ""will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" It's something he's previously floated, and last year two Republican senators introduced a resolution that sought to designate the group as a domestic terrorist organization. Trump's comments echo those of Attorney General William Barr, who said in a statement Saturday: ""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence."" The clashes, spreading to dozens of cities across the U.S., follow a series of racist incidents and deaths of black people, including Floyd's on Monday. Chauvin, now a former Minneapolis police officer, was seen on video kneeling on Floyd's neck while holding him in custody, as Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers present at the scene have been fired, but not arrested or charged. Protests and clashes that have since followed come at a time of unprecedented crisis for the country, with confirmed deaths from the coronavirus pandemic topping 100,000 and millions out of work as a result of broad business shutdowns. Minorities, including African Americans, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 deaths and pandemic-induced economic peril. ""The death of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis was a grave tragedy. It should never have happened. It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger, and grief."" pic.twitter.com/lirAMSv4Wo — The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 30, 2020 Trump addressed the demonstrations Saturday, striking a milder tone during prepared remarks following a manned space launch in Florida than he has on Twitter. He said Floyd's death ""has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger and grief."" He added that he ""understands the pain that people are feeling"" and supports peaceful protest, but that ""the memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists."" ""He should just sometimes stop talking"" Apart from Saturday's remarks, though, Trump has not often played a unifying role in recent days. His tweets about radical-left anarchists have also included criticism of Democratic leadership in Minnesota. In another tweet on Sunday he blamed the mainstream media for fomenting ""hatred and anarchy."" Time for a change! #2020 https://t.co/AECy2GBfys — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020 On Friday, Trump tweeted provocatively that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase with a racist history that Trump said he was not aware of. Later on, he said his intent was not to make a threat, but to register a statement of concern that armed violence can accompany looting. Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, said on Fox News Sunday that the president's tweets about demonstrations turning violent are ""not constructive."" Speaking on ABC's This Week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Sunday morning that she's not paying attention to Trump's inflammatory tweets. Instead, she said he ""should be a unifying force in our country. We have seen that with Democratic and Republican presidents all along. They have seen their responsibility to be the president of the United States, to unify our country, and not to fuel the flame."" Also Sunday, Keisha Lance Bottoms — mayor of Atlanta, one city that's seen protests and clashes with police — told CBS' Face The Nation that Trump's tweets are ""making it worse"" and ""he should just sometimes stop talking."" In his own statement Saturday, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, wrote that ""protesting [Floyd's killing] is right and necessary. It's an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not."" He added that as president, he'd lead the conversation about turning the nation's ""anguish to purpose."" ",0.0
1621763922,2020-05-31 15:15:00,Target Says It Will Temporarily Close Stores In Several States As Protests Continue,https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/target-says-it-will-temporarily-close-stores-several-states-protests-continue,en,False,,332152,hawaiipublicradio.org,http://hawaiipublicradio.org/,"Amid continuing protests over the death of George Floyd, Target has temporarily closed or adjusted hours at more than 200 stores nationwide. The announcement on Saturday from the nation's eighth-largest retailer came after Target stores in multiple cities became scenes of violence and unrest. Among the stores where aisles were ransacked was a Target in Minneapolis near the city's 3rd police precinct, where the four officers who were fired after Floyd's death worked. The 3rd Precinct police station was damaged by a fire last week. ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,"" the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. ""At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores."" A Target spokesperson said that the company is evaluating closures and limiting hours on a store-by-store basis. The majority of stores being closed are located in Minnesota and California, where protests in Los Angeles led the National Guard to be deployed. Stores will also close in Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Despite the violence that has hit its stores, the company has voiced support for demonstrators. ""The murder of George Floyd has unleashed the pent-up pain of years, as have the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote in a public letter on Friday. ""We say their names and hold a too-long list of others in our hearts."" It remains unclear whether the looting at Target stores was committed by demonstrators or whether they were the actions of unaffiliated bad actors. But the ongoing demonstrations have focused scrutiny on Target's past work with law enforcement — including partnerships with agencies in at least 2o cities. In Minneapolis, the company partnered with police on a program that helped install closed-circuit television cameras in the downtown area. A 2010 report released with support from the company said the ""genesis of the program was a widespread feeling some years ago in the city of Minneapolis that the downtown business district was not a pleasant place to work or visit.""

Doug Ducey declared a state of emergency today and announced a statewide, weeklong curfew after several nights of protests turned destructive and violent. The curfew will take effect Sunday night and last from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. each night until June 8, Ducey said in a statement, adding that the emergency declaration “authorizes an expanded National Guard mobilization to protect life and property throughout the state.” The Republican governor also said police “will be equipped to make arrests of individuals who are planning to riot, loot or cause damage and unrest.” Protests have erupted in U.S. cities and Europe in the days after the death of George Floyd, a black man who died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck until he stopped breathing. Phoenix’s first protest unfolded after a Friday vigil for Dion Johnson, a 28-year-old black man who was fatally shot during an encounter with state trooper along a city freeway. Downtown Phoenix has seen three consecutive nights of protests with damage done to 18 buildings that Police Chief Jeri Williams said will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to repair. On Saturday night, people knelt with their hands up in the streets outside Phoenix police and municipal buildings, chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot” and “Black lives matter.” Officers used flash-bang grenades to disperse the crowd. Police said 114 people were arrested on suspicion of rioting and unlawful assembly with five also accused of aggravated assault on a police officer. Seven juveniles were detained for curfew violations and charges of rioting and unlawful assembly, police said. In Tucson, protesters damaged some downtown buildings and vandalized the city’s police station over two nights leading to a handful of arrests. The upscale Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale was targeted by protesters for the first time Saturday night with some people smashing windows at a dozen stores in and around the city’s Fashion Square before grabbing goods. Scottsdale police said in a statement that 12 people were arrested on various charges and “at least one assault has been reported and millions of dollars in damages and theft occurred.” Volunteers used shovels and brooms today to clean up broken glass at the damaged Scottsdale stores and covered windows with plywood boards. “The looting and violence we saw last night, especially in Scottsdale, simply cannot be tolerated. And it won’t be,” Ducey said. “Destruction of property does not qualify as freedom of expression.”",0.0
1621782626,2020-05-31 18:09:00,"Officials see extremist groups, disinformation in protests",https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/05/31/breaking-news/officials-see-extremist-groups-disinformation-in-protests/,en,False,,39573,HonululuAdvertiser,http://www.staradvertiser.com/,"WASHINGTON >> U.S. officials sought to determine today whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media. As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work. Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort. The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations. The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said today that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. “Before our operation kicked off last night, a very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers was executed,” Walz said. “That’s not somebody sitting in their basement. That’s pretty sophisticated.” Walz did not offer details. President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Barr today said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to “identify criminal organizers,” and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group. Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists, too. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to hundreds of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized “Boogaloo” movement, which uses an ’80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war. She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some “boogaloo bois” in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear. “I think mostly they don’t want to hurt these protests. They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,” MacNab said. She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest. Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. “It’s very scattershot,” she said. “They are all talking about it, but they don’t seem to be able to translate that online fantasizing about what they’d like to do into real-world action, which is good.” Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump’s handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were “good people on both sides” of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia. America’s racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. “This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,” said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. “That’s one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don’t create new issues, you exploit existing issues.” There’s a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook. Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it’s not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a “child militia.” Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck even as he cried he couldn’t breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy. “They had tools to break windows and tools or a strategy to distribute materials, among them,” she said. “The thing that we’re struck by is that it was an organized group that appeared more bent on destruction on then on protest.”",0.0

To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: As we've heard, many cities saw protests this week. So has Washington, D.C., the nation's capital. There have been peaceful and angry protests set off by the death in police custody of George Floyd. Last night, those protests turned violent. As demonstrators were tear gassed and driven away from the White House. Nearby businesses were vandalized and some small fires set. Now there is another protest underway. Joining us from Washington, D.C., near the White House is NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. And, Danielle, you've been with this group for a few hours. How are things going? DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, HOST: Well, in short, things are tense. But they seem to have calmed down from where they were about an hour ago. Right now, the march had started at Howard University this afternoon. A historically black university here in D.C. It went down to Lafayette Park. North of the White House, and then since then has moved. The march went down near the Mall. It is now sort of looping back towards the White House. But along the way, there were some confrontations with police that I saw between protesters and police, yes. MARTIN: So it sounds like the mood has definitely shifted from when you started. KURTZLEBEN: Yes because, you know, it was a peaceful protest with chanting, you know, going from the university to the White House with a police escort. It was loud. It was enthusiastic, certainly not violent in any way. Then, down at Lafayette Park, what happened was the protesters were up against some barricade facing a long line of Secret Service members and also D.C. Park Police. And things just got progressively tenser - again, not out of control, not exactly violent. But there were times when you would see the Secret Service advance on the crowd as the crowd got louder and more agitated. And the crowd would run. The crowd would scream. The crowd would yell back at them. Things were getting more and more tense, yes. MARTIN: Now we hear that the mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser, has weighed in. KURTZLEBEN: Yes. She has put in place a curfew starting at 11:00 p.m. tonight. It will go until 6:00 a.m. in the morning. So the big question then is, you know, how quickly these protesters clear the streets because that is rapidly approaching. MARTIN: So what have people that you've been spending time with today told you about why they're there? KURTZLEBEN: They've told me they're fed up. They've told me that, you know, they keep seeing police violence against black men in particular, black women also, and that they're tired of seeing it. Aside from that, I've been watching people confront the police. I was there for a pretty tense confrontation between people and police. And especially a lot of black protesters going up to some black members of the D.C. police force, sometimes reaching out and saying, you're my brother, you're my sister, but sometimes asking them, hey, why are you doing this job? I am very sad and ashamed that you do this job. And, you know, in some cases, I was right there when they shot or threw I believe it was a smoke bomb into the crowd. There were some really loud booms, some very tense, scary moments for these protesters here in downtown D.C. today. Again, I will say I haven't seen anybody hurt. Nothing is out of control or anything like that that I have seen. MARTIN: That is NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. She is presently at Lafayette Park, which is near the White House. Danielle, thank you so much for your reporting. KURTZLEBEN: Yes, of course. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0
1621807081,2020-05-31 18:36:49,"US Cities Clean Up, Prepare For Another Night Of Unrest",https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/us-cities-clean-prepare-another-night-unrest,en,False,,332152,hawaiipublicradio.org,http://hawaiipublicradio.org/,"MINNEAPOLIS — America’s cities boarded up windows, swept up glass and covered graffiti Sunday as the country's most significant night of protests in a half-century spilled into another day of unrest fueled by killings of black people at the hands of police. The turbulence sparked by the death of George Floyd — a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes — shook not only the streets of New York and Los Angeles, but dozens of smaller communities such as Fargo, North Dakota, and Lincoln, Nebraska. The damage extended even to buildings near the White House. “They keep killing our people,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston on Sunday. “I’m so sick and tired of it.” Peaceful protests involving tens of thousands of people on Saturday gave way, in some places, to violence, with police vehicles torched, stores emptied and objects hurled at officers. The police response varied from restrained to aggressive, with officers at times firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Police and peaceful protesters alike pleaded for a stop to violence, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. “It only hurts the cause,” said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed the heart of the city. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Minneapolis, police, state troopers and National Guard members showed new force Saturday in breaking up demonstrations after three days of police largely avoiding engaging protesters. Dozens of protests were underway or expected Sunday, from Miami to Kansas City to San Francisco. They went forth largely without incident, but sparks of crime continued. In Philadelphia, people robbed stores in broad daylight, and at least one more police vehicle was set ablaze. Streets leading downtown were closed. Chicago likewise restricted downtown access and called in the National Guard. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out. Among those descending on Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said. County Commissioner Angela Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who held his knee on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired. “We’ll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,” Conley said. In tweets Sunday, President Donald Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. Few parts of America were untouched. Protesters set fires inside Reno’s city hall, and police launched tear gas at rock-throwing demonstrators in Fargo, North Dakota. In Salt Lake City, demonstrators flipped a police car and lit it on fire. Police said six people were arrested and an officer was injured after being struck in the head with a baseball bat. By Sunday, the fury had spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In New York, a video Saturday showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects. Several people were knocked to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses, and people need to stop killing black people,” Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. Buildings around the U.S. were defaced with spray-painted messages, from the facade of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd's gasped last words — “I can't breathe” — were repeated, alongside anti-police messages. Crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. Some leaders prepared to put more soldiers in the streets. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp authorized the deployment of up to 3,000 National Guard troops to Athens, Savannah and any other cities where more demonstrations were planned. Kemp had already approved up to 1,500 Guardsmen to help enforce a 9 p.m. Saturday curfew in Atlanta. This week’s unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd’s killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses have yet to approach the staggering totals LA saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.",0.0

City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters’ movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry — boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. >> PHOTO GALLERY: Protesters start fires near White House A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Secret Service agents had rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades. The president spent nearly an hour in the bunker designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to some of the demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the killing of George Floyd. >> PHOTO GALLERY: Protesters rally in Los Angeles At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. “They keep killing our people,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. “I’m so sick and tired of it.” But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, then pulling a woman out of the passenger seat and appearing to use a stun gun on a man who was driving. Police Chief Erika Shields called it “really shocking to watch.” In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. About 30 miles (48 kilometers) south, as hundreds of protesters gathered in Long Beach, scores of thieves swarmed into nearby outlet stores. A steady stream emerged from a Forever 21 store carrying armloads of clothing. Some hauled it away in garbage bags, and a few stopped outside to change into stolen items. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd’s neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol as state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers lined up in front of about a dozen military-style armored vehicles. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest both Saturday and today. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days. In tweets today, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” Among in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling.

1621864682,2020-05-31 21:45:00,George Floyd’s death opens old wounds for NBA player Thabo Sefolosha,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/05/31/sports/sports-breaking/george-floyds-death-opens-old-wounds-for-nba-player-thabo-sefolosha/,en,False,,39573,HonululuAdvertiser,http://www.staradvertiser.com/,"Thabo Sefolosha knows what it’s like to be a black man, on the ground, being beaten by police officers. Such was the scenario when George Floyd died in Minneapolis last week. And five years ago, Sefolosha found himself in a similarly frightening place. “I was just horrified by what I saw,” Sefolosha said. “That could have been me.” Time has not healed all wounds for Sefolosha, the NBA veteran who said he was attacked by a group of New York Police Department officers in April 2015 while they were arresting him outside a nightclub in the city’s Chelsea neighborhood. The leg that was broken in the fracas is fine now. The emotional pain roared back last week when he saw video of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air in the final moments of his life as a white police officer — subsequently charged with murder — pressed a knee on his neck. Sefolosha has seen the video. He hasn’t watched much news since. His experience with police in New York has left him with a deep distrust of law enforcement, the pangs of angst flooding back even when he walks into NBA arenas and sees uniformed officers. And the latest example of police brutality left him even more upset. “People talk about a few rotten apples,” Sefolosha said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But you know, in my experience and from what we’re seeing, I think it’s deeper than that as a culture that’s deeply rooted in it, to be honest. That’s just my honest opinion. I think it’s really … part of a culture where it’s deeper than just a few bad apples.” The four officers who were involved in the incident where Floyd died were fired; the one who knelt on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Massive protests have broken out in several cities in recent days, the country torn again over a black man dying at the hands of police. Sefolosha — a black man of Swiss descent who plays for the Houston Rockets — considered but decided against joining protests in Atlanta, where he is waiting for the resumption of the NBA season that was shut down in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. “I’m mad, for sure,” Sefolosha said. “That’s for sure. I mean, it’s 2020. Nobody should have to go through this in this time, especially after black people have given up so much for America. Black people have given up so much and done so much for this country. It’s hurtful to see it this way.” Sefolosha’s perspective changed forever on April 8, 2015. Chris Copeland, an NBA player at the time, was among three people stabbed outside the club where Sefolosha was that night; police arrived and ordered everyone to leave the area. Sefolosha says he complied but began getting harassed by officers anyway. Before long, he was on the ground. Sefolosha’s leg was broken and some ligaments were torn in the fracas, and he was arrested on several charges that a jury needed about 45 minutes to determine were unfounded. He wound up suing for $50 million, alleging his civil rights were violated, settled for $4 million and gave much of that money to a public defenders’ organization working in marginalized communities. “It changed me a lot, toward the way I see law enforcement in this country,” Sefolosha said. “And also toward the way I see the whole justice system. I went to court and I had to do all of this to prove my innocence. It really got me deep into the system and I’m really skeptical of the whole system.” NBA players have used their platforms often in recent years to protest racial inequality. Sterling Brown of the Milwaukee Bucks filed a federal civil rights lawsuit after police used a stun gun on him and arrested him over a parking incident in 2018. On Saturday, Malcolm Brogdon of the Indiana Pacers and Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics were among those taking part in Atlanta protests. “You see what happened in Minnesota where three human beings with a badge are watching another human being killing somebody,” said Sefolosha, who has played in the NBA since 2006 and intends to return to Switzerland when he retires. “And instead of saying, ‘OK, this is my duty as a human being,’ the duty was more toward not interfering with the other officer and saying, ‘We are clan, we stick together no matter what.’ It should be the other way around.” The NBA is closing in on finalizing a plan to resume the season in July at the Disney complex near Orlando, Florida. Sefolosha and the Rockets figure to be contenders for a championship when play resumes. For obvious reasons, Sefolosha’s mind isn’t there yet. “I’ll be happy to be with my teammates and reunited with basketball in general,” Sefolosha said. “But you know, we’re human beings, and the fight has been going on for too long and the same protests have been going on for too long. I think it’s definitely time for change and that should be a priority for all of us.”",0.0

And police killings of black men and women. Jimmy Mills’ life has been upended by both. His barbershop in Midtown Minneapolis was one of many small, black-owned businesses that have struggled to survive the pandemic. But Mills was hopeful because, after two months shut down, he was due to reopen next week. Then early Friday, the working-class neighborhood where Mills has cut hair for 12 years went up in flames as chaotic protests over the death of George Floyd and police killings of African-Americans engulfed Minneapolis and cities across the country. “To have corona, and then this — it’s like a gut shot,” Mills, 56, said. The upheaval sparked by a video capturing Floyd’s agonizing last minutes as a white police officer kneels on his neck is pulsing through an America already ragged with anger and anxiety. Emotions are raw over the toll of a pandemic that has killed more than 100,000 people across the country and cost millions of jobs. On Sunday, at least another 600 Americans were reported to have died from COVID-19. Minneapolis residents said outrage and protests in the aftermath of the killing of Floyd were a result of a community being tested repeatedly in recent weeks by both police violence and the virus — and in ways that put America’s deep racial inequalities in stark relief. The outbreak has inflicted disproportionate economic and health tolls on racial minorities and immigrants in Minneapolis and beyond. Black and Latino workers have been more likely to have lost their jobs. Many others are among the low-paid hourly workers who risk their health by going to work at grocery stores, nursing homes, factories, slaughterhouses and other jobs that cannot be done remotely. The black community in Minnesota has also been hit hard by cases of the virus, just as African-Americans across the country are being infected and dying at higher rates. By one estimate, black people accounted for at least 29% of known COVID-19 cases in Minnesota, despite making up about 6% of the state’s population. African-Americans make up 35% of coronavirus cases in Minneapolis, although they are less than 20% of the city’s population. “There are no words to describe what people are going through,” said state Rep. Mohamud Noor, who represents a district with many Somalis and other immigrants. His great-uncle died of the coronavirus a few days ago, and Noor said he is losing track of how many other relatives and constituents are dying. Noor said that the school closures had hurt poorer students without laptops or reliable internet access to take classes online, and that waves of job losses had sent local unemployment rates soaring. Now, with more than 200 businesses damaged or destroyed in the unrest, Noor said he was worried about new waves of foreclosures, job losses and business failures. “Many people who are poor who didn’t have much, this devastation will really impact them,” Noor said. Even before the pandemic, the Midtown neighborhood, where buildings were burned, damaged and looted, had been trying to rebuild itself after years of economic hardship. The area is in a historically segregated part of town where some residents had felt neglected. A railway was repurposed into a bike and walking trail that runs through the neighborhood. The Midtown Global Market had sprung up, attracting diners and shoppers to its Hmong, Indian, Moroccan and other international food and crafts. But now, next door to Mills, the barber, a dollar store and beauty-supply shop have been burned to rubble. The front windows of Mills’ barbershop were smashed, and looters stole his televisions, video equipment and his clippers. Now, with the power out, water seeping across the floor and phalanxes of police officers and National Guard troops blockading his neighborhood, he does not know when his J-Klips barbershop might reopen. “Half of the place is condemned,” he said. “Where do we go from here?” Phillipe Cunningham, a city council member, represents a poor ward in northern Minneapolis with a large black, Hmong and Native American population. He said had spent the past two months fighting to get a coronavirus testing site opened and fielding calls from laid-off workers falling behind on rent and black business owners unable to navigate the maze of federal relief programs. On Friday, Cunningham drove around surveying damaged buildings, helping some of the same business owners board up their storefronts and trying to prevent looters from breaking into stores. “We were already struggling,” Cunningham said. In many pockets of the city where the virus seemed to be more concentrated, residents have not had access to masks and hand sanitizer, even as the mayor ordered masks be worn when inside businesses as of last week, said Jia Starr Brown, pastor of First Covenant Church in downtown Minneapolis. Even healthy people in Minneapolis were feeling anxious after a long stretch of being holed up in their homes as spring arrived; a limited reopening of businesses was not set to begin until Monday. That loosening of restrictions came with a long list of social-distancing and sanitation rules. Brown spoke as she stepped away from a protest outside a county building Friday afternoon, saying she was heartened to see so many people attend rallies calling for justice for Floyd, even when doing so was a health risk. “This is about collective widespread grief, and how great must the grief be that people would risk their livelihoods?” she said. “Who we are as a people is greater than the risk to be out there. This is urgent. This isn’t about just our own individual lives as black people, but this is about our futures and children.” Many young people, especially minorities, were gig-economy workers holding two or three part-time jobs that evaporated when the outbreak hit, said Tyler Sit, pastor of the New City Church, which is blocks away from where Floyd died and from the Third Precinct that was burned in the protests. They were left jobless and worried about not having benefits should they become ill. Sitting at home during lockdown, with no work and no prospect of finding work for the foreseeable future, he said, they were more aware than usual of news reports and then had the time to react by taking to the streets. “I hear messages from community members trying to deliberate whether or not they’re going to show up. They don’t want to catch COVID-19 and spread COVID-19 if they happen to be an asymptomatic carrier,” he said. “But there’s a deep feeling of we have to do something because our city is burning.” In Atlanta, Denver, New York and beyond, protesters have also emerged despite the pandemic. They have slipped on face masks and bandannas to guard against the coronavirus, as well as tear gas. Anais Nunez, a 31-year-old community organizer from the Allerton neighborhood of the Bronx, said she braved the risk of coming to a crowded protest to show solidarity with others marching against police violence. “I’m from the Bronx, the epicenter of the epicenter,” she said about the borough that has the city’s highest rates of cases, hospitalizations and deaths from the coronavirus. “We’re already suffering. Having to do all of this, it makes the terrible even worse.” Rashawn Ray, a sociologist and fellow at the Brookings Institution, said one crucial difference between the two plagues is that the coronavirus, like past diseases, may one day dissipate with a vaccine or medical breakthrough. “We’ve never gotten to a place where racism is not a significant part of everyone’s life in the United States,” he said.",0.0

In more than 20 cities, thieves smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry — boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes and cellphones and TVs. Nearly 400 people were arrested in Los Angeles from unrest Saturday as protests have become increasingly violent over several nights because of outrage over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, Police Chief Michel Moore said. Moore said he hoped the National Guard and additional officers deployed would help. But before the sun set, there was brazen theft in Santa Monica and Long Beach even while nearby protests were mostly peaceful. Violence statewide include an arm wound suffered by a gunshot victim in Walnut Creek. >> PHOTO GALLERY: Protesters rally in Los Angeles In Sacramento, where no curfew was imposed, nightfall brought more violence and destruction at businesses in the city’s midtown area and near the Capitol after a largely peaceful daytime protest. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at those who ignored orders to leave. Across the state, devastated shop owners cleaned up. In Emeryville, across the bay from San Francisco, where thieves stormed malls late Saturday, Keyla Calderon swept up glass outside the medical scrubs shop Uniform Advantage. Calderon’s store had just reopened after being shuttered for six weeks under California’s orders to stem spread of the coronavirus. She said she had just returned home Saturday when she learned the burglar alarm was triggered. She turned on the news to see scenes of people breaking into her shop and others. “To hear the alarm ring and see people destroy the store before my eyes, it was heartbreaking,” Calderon said. “We’re all working hard to feed our family. We have nothing to do with these injustices, yet we’re paying the consequences.” Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed 1,000 members of the Guard to assist the 20,000 officers of the Los Angeles police and sheriff’s departments, Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The San Francisco police chief said about 200 outside officers were en route. Humvees lined up outside Los Angeles City Hall, and troops stood behind police on the steps of the building as protesters gathered despite a curfew. Unrest in Santa Monica happened not far from a peaceful demonstration near the city’s famous pier as looters targeted shops near the popular Third Street Promenade. They broke into a Gap store and a Vans sneaker store, walking out with boxes with no police in sight. A woman holding a sign saying “End All Violence” tried to block a man with a hammer from smashing the door of an REI store. The man yanked her from the door. She returned to the doorway and another protester joined her and the vandals eventually moved on. But others later made off with merchandise. As protesters gathered in Long Beach, thieves swarmed nearby stores at The Pike Outlets. A Forever 21 store was a favored target, and a steady stream emerged carrying armloads of clothing. Some stopped to change into stolen items. A bizarre scene unfolded about a half-mile away when people stealing from a clothing store became trapped inside as police gathered outside the mostly boarded-up store front. A woman screamed inside and then a man kicked his way out a window above the plywood and dropped to the sidewalk. He was followed by more than a half-dozen others, with one man throwing out an armload of clothes and then gathering them up and running off as police nearby didn’t attempt to make arrests. About 1,000 people marched through the streets of San Francisco, carrying signs and chanting “George Floyd,” “Black Lives Matter.” “We’re here because George Floyd was murdered in cold blood,” Aliasiah Allah said. In San Diego, a protest took an ominous turn after several hours when police said they fired tear gas to disperse a crowd pelting them with rocks and bottles. In Los Angeles, damage from Saturday’s violence included windows shattered at nearly every shop along a stretch of trendy Melrose Avenue. Alan Kokozian looked up through a hole in the roof of Tony K’s Shoe Store, where fire had burned and most of his inventory was stolen or damaged. He had pleaded for people to spare his establishment and was struck in the head with a bottle. “This was not a political protest,” Kokozian said. Officials acknowledged the anger of protesters over the death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee to Floyd’s neck, and affirmed their right to demonstrate. But they condemned the wave of crime by a small number that had overshadowed the protest message. “It breaks my heart, too, to think about the Angelenos protesting in peace and fighting for justice how this violence and looting clouds that picture,” Garcetti said. Yet it was hard to ignore images of police cars engulfed in flames in Los Angeles, people running out the broken door of an Alexander McQueen luxury clothing store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills or demonstrators tossing fireworks at officers in Santa Ana. There was also video of officers in skirmish lines in LA, some swinging clubs at protesters, others firing projectiles at people with their hands up and crowds running from a cloud of tear gas in Beverly Hills. Garcetti praised the 99.99% of officers he said had shown restraint. Moore, who was on the front lines Saturday, said officers had acted appropriately, though he acknowledged some “individual failures.” Five LAPD officers were injured in the clashes and two hospitalized, including one who required surgery after his skull was fractured by a brick, Moore said. San Francisco’s popular Union Square saw people stealing leather bags from the Coach store and shoes from the Salvatore Ferragamo location, The Mercury News reported. Streets were littered with bras from Victoria’s Secret and cushioned jewelry boxes from Swarovski. Mayor London Breed said the city’s 8 p.m. curfew would be extended indefinitely. Breed expressed sadness about the destruction and said she was not going to tolerate the violence. “I was extremely upset because unfortunately with some of the vandals, they thought this was a game, they thought this was funny,” Breed said. Protests also roiled the east San Diego suburb of La Mesa, where two adjacent banks burned to the ground. “I think people are hurting and they’re angry and they’re trying to be heard because there’s no other way to get anyone’s attention,” Ally Kaiahua said of the property damage in La Mesa.",0.0

Some cities, including Minneapolis, Atlanta and Louisville, saw clashes with police, buildings and cars set afire, and looting. By evening, many demonstrations had given way to another night of violence and destruction, with protesters ignoring curfews imposed in dozens of cities. Police used tear gas and stun grenades and fired rubber bullets in attempts to disperse the crowds. More than 17,000 National Guard troops have been activated in states across the U.S. due to civil unrest as of Monday, and that number is expected to grow. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody last Monday. Video shows that a Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes shortly before his death. Tensions were already simmering following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in February and Breonna Taylor in March. Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was jogging through a Glynn County, Ga., neighborhood when he was shot dead. Three white men were arrested last month after state investigators took over the case from local authorities. Protests also continued for a fourth straight night in Louisville, Ky., as activists called for justice for Taylor. Police shot and killed the 26-year-old black woman in her home. Truck barrels into Minneapolis protesters In Minneapolis, a semitrailer plowed through a crowd of protesters marching on an interstate highway near downtown that had been closed to traffic. Authorities say no one was injured when the truck drove into the crowd at a high speed, northbound on Interstate 35W. According to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the driver may have been unaware of the highway closure. ""It appears the semi was on I-35W as authorities were closing the road. It didn't appear to drive through any barricades,"" the department tweeted. Some protesters jumped on top of the truck, and as it stopped, they dragged the driver out of the front seat and started beating him. The driver, identified by police as Bogdan Vechirko of Otsego, Minn., is being held on probable cause for assault. He was taken to a hospital and is being treated for his injuries. ""He was driving a gas tanker,"" said Rhys Gailah, 39, who was in the middle of a sit-in listening to speakers when the truck came barreling through. ""He came driving at least 50 miles per hour through the crowd. Everyone was sitting. It was peaceful."" State Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington says authorities had shut down the freeway so that the protesters, who numbered from 4,000 to 5,000, could safely demonstrate. Before the incident, the protest had appeared peaceful. Tensions flare in the nation's capital Washington, D.C., authorities imposed a curfew after an evening of escalating demonstrations. Protesters threw bottles at police and set fires to cars and the basement of historic St. John's Church, which has been visited by every president since James Madison. ""Tonight's curfew will begin at 7 p.m. and will run for two days,"" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a late morning news conference on Monday. It's primary day in the nation's capital on Tuesday, and the curfew goes into effect an hour before polls close at 8 p.m., according to the District of Columbia Board of Elections website. The protests on Sunday began with peaceful marchers, along with a police escort, moving their way along a nearly 2-mile stretch from Howard University to Lafayette Square in front of the White House. Protesters chanted about the death of Floyd and other African Americans who have died following police violence. ""Even in the middle of a pandemic, cops are killing us,"" read a sign carried by protester Elizabeth Betts. ""It's crazy how even in the middle of a pandemic, black people have to protest like this,"" she said. ""We are at a point where it's the same story, the same things are happening. I'm tired of this."" But after clashes with law enforcement and the fires erupting, police pushed the crowds away from the White House with bursts of tear gas. Kentucky authorities investigate shooting death in Louisville Kentucky's governor said that one person died early Monday as security forces confronted a crowd in central Louisville. ""While working to disperse a crowd, [Louisville Metro Police Department] and the Kentucky National Guard were fired upon,"" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. ""LMPD and the Kentucky National Guard returned fire resulting in a death."" He announced that the Kentucky State Police will be investigating the matter. Statement from Governor Andy Beshear: pic.twitter.com/MyHxcE3Ntn — Governor Andy Beshear (@GovAndyBeshear) June 1, 2020 Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted his ""deepest condolences"" for the family of the man, whom he identified as David McAtee. Fischer also called for a Day of Reflection on Monday. He held a late morning virtual gathering on Facebook with faith leaders after another night of demonstrations in the city over the death of Breonna Taylor. On Sunday, law enforcement officers earlier fired tear gas into a crowd assembled in the Jefferson Square area of the city, NPR member station WFPL reported. At a Sunday evening news conference, Fischer again thanked those protesting peacefully but said others were ""hijacking"" their efforts. Tomorrow, Monday, June 1, 2020 I am declaring a Day of Reflection in our city. We will have a virtual gathering at 11:30 a.m. Monday on Facebook with local faith leaders. We’ll be talking about the events of the last few days & acknowledging the pain we’ve all felt. 2/2 — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) June 1, 2020 Atlanta officers terminated for excessive force Two Atlanta police officers have been terminated and three others placed on desk duty after a video of the arrest of two young African Americans leaving the protests Saturday night went viral. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the officers' firing on Sunday, saying the footage ""was disturbing on many levels."" ""We understand our officers are working very long hours, under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that veteran officers Mark Gardner and Ivory Streeter were terminated. The footage from Streeter's body camera shows the officers confronting the pair as the two were leaving the downtown protests after the 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. At roughly the 2:30 mark in the video, one of them is seen sitting in the driver's seat of a car, recording officers arresting someone else. An officer opens the car door and asks the driver if he wants to go to jail. Several minutes later, officers approach the car again. One uses a baton to smash the driver's side window. Police then use a stun gun on the driver, who has been identified by local media as Messiah Young. Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that Young suffered an epileptic seizure, according to Spelman College's Student Government Association. The second person, a woman who has since been identified as Taniyah Pilgrim, has been released from custody and charges against her dropped. Footage posted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows the passenger pleading with police to stop as they also use a stun gun against her. ''They haven't heard us"": Protests escalate in Southern California Vandalism and violence broke out after peaceful protests in Santa Monica and other parts of Southern California on Sunday — a sequence of events that has become familiar in many U.S. cities in the past week. The new round of destruction came despite a curfew and the presence of the National Guard. ""We tried kneeling,"" protester Jesus Guzman, 19, told NPR's Doualy Xaykaothao near the Santa Monica Pier. ""We tried putting on those T-shirts that said 'I can't breathe.' We tried those hashtags. We tried doing it all peacefully, but they haven't heard us — they haven't done nothing."" ""The violence, for him, is justified,"" Xaykaothao reported. With store windows smashed, some shop owners in Santa Monica started cleaning up the mess overnight — the latest setback after weeks of forced closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At their hair salon, Martha Padilla-Bruni and her family were sweeping up broken glass under the streetlights. ""I'm in shock. I don't know what's going to happen,"" Padilla-Bruni told NPR's Nathan Rott. Her son, Joe Franco, said he supports the protesters and those who were there earlier in the day. He said he understands that people are in pain. Franco said, ""But I was here across the street, and what I saw, the people that were doing this ... they were not here to protest. They were here to cause trouble."" Reporter in Long Beach, Calif., hit in throat by rubber bullet KPCC/LAist reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez was hit in the throat by a rubber bullet Sunday evening during protests in Long Beach, Calif. He believes the bullet was fired by Long Beach police, who had been firing the projectiles nearby. ""I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat,"" Guzman-Lopez said via Twitter, posting an image of his wound. ""I had just interviewed a man with my phone at 3rd and Pine and a police officer aimed and shot me in the throat, I saw the bullet bounce onto the street."" I just got hit by a rubber bullet near the bottom of my throat.

The reporter said he had just finished interviewing a man who had been kneeling in protest when he himself was hit. ""I talked to him for about a minute, and just as I was finishing talking to him — right after I said, 'Thank you' — I heard a pop and I felt something, you know, the bottom of my throat, and I saw something bounced onto the ground, and then I ran,"" he said. ""As I was running, I did start to feel its sting, and then I put my fingers to my throat and there was blood on my fingers."" A number of journalists have been hit with police projectiles during the protests, including MSNBC's Ali Velshi, who was shot in the leg by a rubber bullet in Minneapolis, and a Louisville TV reporter who was shot with pepper balls. NPR's Gerry Holmes contributed to this report. : 6/03/20 An earlier version of this story mistakenly said the truck drove into the crowd while westbound on Interstate 35.

A volunteer from the neighborhood walks out onto Lake Street. ""Is this your business?"" she asks. Safia and her daughter Saida Hassan nod silently. ""I'm sorry,"" the woman says. It's the first time they've seen it since fiery protests erupted in cries for racial justice and state troopers in riot gear blocked the road to this street. The walls are charred black, the kitchen reduced to rubble. Glass and water are swimming in puddles as community members around them work to sweep away the destruction. Safia looks around stunned. Hers is one of hundreds of businesses damaged or destroyed in protests Thursday and Friday night. ""Alhamdulillah,"" she repeats quietly. Praise God. ""Everyone is safe."" ""My heart is broken. My mind is broken,"" she says. ""I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice."" George Floyd is the African American man who died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee last Monday for several minutes. Protests started in Minneapolis early last week and quickly spread across the country. Floyd's pleading words to the officer, ""I can't breathe,"" are now a rallying cry for people protesting the many black people who have died in police custody. Safia, a Somali immigrant, opened the restaurant in December 2018 with her retirement savings. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic she closed the restaurant and had to choose between paying for insurance and paying staff. So Safia chose her staff. That means there were no funds to rebuild. A GoFundMe page was set up to help the family. This weekend she had planned to reopen as the city started easing stay-at-home orders. She spent over $4,000 on groceries and cleanup. Now that plan is gone. ""It's not just me,"" she says. ""It's all of Lake Street, all of Minneapolis."" Her daughter Saida nods. ""This is a city in pain,"" Saida says. Across the street a row of restaurants — all locally owned, black and immigrant-owned — are all gone. But the library is OK. In the rubble, Saida finds the sign she made for her mother when the restaurant first opened. Against the black ash the wood plaque is pristine. It reads ""Mama Safia's Kitchen. Seasoned with Love."" ""Because she always cooks with love,"" Saida says. She pulls a few more knickknacks that haven't burned. ""Most of the artifacts here, I got them from Africa,"" she says. ""This one is from Somalia."" She puts them into a tiny pile of what is salvageable. Outside is a tower of all that is lost. Her sister Bibi Abdullah walks in to help. She finds prayer rugs in the banquet room her mom would rent out for small wedding dinners and religious holidays. ""We can still use these,"" she says. ""We just have to wash them."" She searches for more things she can save. ""The truth is things like this happen when people feel powerless. Something has to change,"" Bibi says. Her voice catches. Her body seems to vibrate with a mix of anger and sadness. She says she hopes that these demonstrations translate to voters at the polls come November. ""It came to this because we have people that do not care in positions of power and it should not be that way,"" Bibi says. She and her sister start to clear the big debris together. Then Saida leads her mother, Safia, to the kitchen in the back so they can assess the damage. It's a tunnel of charred walls, ash and debris. Safia gets upset and pulls away, speaking to her daughter in Somali. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" Saida responds in English as her mother walks out. ""She's just saying, 'Why are you bringing me in here? I don't want to see this,' "" Saida says. Saida gets quiet. She stands in the kitchen alone for a moment, staring at the charred walls. Then she joins her family outside where dozens of Minneapolis residents from across the city are working in groups to clear the rubble. With everything unfolding, the pandemic has slipped many people's minds. ""I forgot. Have you seen me shake hands with people?"" Saida shakes her head. ""2020, we hear you, we see you. We went from one crisis to the next. What's next?"" Saida spends every night protesting, but also trying to protect other locally owned stores and restaurants. At night she cries herself to sleep. She understands the anger and desperation that are leading some to destroy buildings. ""I'm like emotionally torn,"" Saida says. She doesn't want destruction. ""But at the same time, people are crying for help. People are saying, 'Fix this.' "" She says she hopes, from all of this pain, finally there will be change. ",0.0
1622321209,2020-06-01 05:00:00,Trump Seems Likely To Use Law And Order As A Wedge Issue After George Floyd's Killing,https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/trump-seems-likely-use-law-and-order-wedge-issue-after-george-floyds-killing,en,False,,332152,hawaiipublicradio.org,http://hawaiipublicradio.org/,"Through days of unrest, dozens of American cities — from Minneapolis to Atlanta, from New York to Grand Rapids, Mich. — have been wracked by violent protests. Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Some health experts have warned that a resurgence in cases could take place if Americans don't adhere to strict social distancing, or take other precautions like wear masks. The White House has also said that cases could go down in the warmer summer months. Does that happen? And if so, do Americans get too comfortable and lapse into a false sense of security — only to see a spike in the fall? None of it's clear, but the U.S. is heading into a period of pandemic experimentation with no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus as yet. 3. Could Steve King lose? Steny Hoyer faces challenge: It's hard to believe, but there are elections on Tuesday. Two of the marquee races deal with well-known — and very different — political figures. Controversial Rep. Steve King, with a history of making racist remarks, is in a fight for his political life with state Sen. Randy Feenstra in Iowa's Republican primary. Conservative groups have lined up against King, but he can't be counted out. This district has a long history of voting for him, despite his pariah status within the party. In Maryland, Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, is facing a primary challenge from the left in 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes, inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's unlikely win in New York over Joe Crowley, a former congressional Democratic leader. Iowa, Maryland and several other states, plus Washington, D.C., hold primaries Tuesday. 4. Biden to get closer to officially clinching nomination: Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is on the ballot Tuesday, too. Remember, he still hasn't acquired the delegates needed to officially put him over the top for the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of doing that. With 500 at stake Tuesday, Biden needs 85% of them Tuesday to clinch. That's unlikely, so look at next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote — with their 133 delegates up for grabs — for Biden to hit the magic number of 1,991. (Follow all the math here with the NPR delegate tracker.) 5. Origins of Trump campaign investigation to be probed: In Congress, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into members of the 2016 Trump campaign. The Senate is also expected to vote on nominations, including for the Treasury Department's inspector general for the pandemic response. And action is possible on changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. Last week, the House, nearly unanimously, passed a bill that reduces the percentage of the loans that businesses have to use toward payroll and gives businesses more time to spend the money and to pay the loans back. Flashback quotation: ""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, 'Please don't be too nice.' When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head]. Like, 'Don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?'

After six straight days of unrest, a new routine was developing: residents waking up to neighborhoods in shambles, shopkeepers taking stock of ransacked stores, and police and political leaders weighing how to address the boiling anger. While many of the demonstrations around the country have been peaceful protests by racially diverse crowds, others have descended into violence, despite curfews in big cities across the U.S. and the deployment of thousands of National Guard soldiers over the past week. On Sunday, protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin, Texas, and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early today when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them first, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis. In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry, leaving shop owners, many of them just beginning to reopen their businesses after the coronavirus shutdowns, to clean up their shattered stores. In other places, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators. The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes. Racial tensions were also running high after two white men were arrested in May in the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and after Louisville, Kentucky, police shot Breonna Taylor to death in her home in March. The upheaval has unfolded amid the gloom and economic ruin caused by the coronavirus, which has killed over 100,000 Americans and sent unemployment soaring to levels not seen since the Depression. The outbreak has hit minorities especially hard, not just in infections and deaths but in job losses and economic stress. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests has rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. At least 4,400 people have been arrested for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count compiled by The Associated Press. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name!” At the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, police fired tear gas and stun grenades Sunday into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a street nearby. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the flames. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office was burned down. The district’s entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to Pentagon officials. As the unrest grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton, who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, talked to demonstrators and wrote a post online expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd’s killing. On Monday, Biden met with community leaders at a predominantly African American church. “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” said Sylvester Beaman, pastor of the Bethel AME church in Wilmington. In New York, thieves raided luxury stores, including Chanel, Rolex and Prada boutiques. In Birmingham, Alabama, a Confederate statute was toppled. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Thousands marched peacefully in Phoenix; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying the destruction weakens calls for justice and reform. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said two officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday and using stun guns on the man and woman inside. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. Scores of people swarmed into stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags. In Minneapolis, the officer who pinned Floyd to the pavement has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. “They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest, but thousands marching on a closed freeway were shaken when a tractor-trailer rolled into their midst. No serious injuries were reported. The driver was arrested on suspicion of assault. In tweets Sunday, Trump accused anarchists and the media of fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems.",0.0

The officer’s colleagues quickly pushed him away from the woman and down the street. Mayor Dean Trantalis told reporters the officer has been suspended pending an investigation. He was not named. “If it’s turned out that he acted inappropriately, then we will have swift discipline in response to what he did. We do not appreciate that kind of conduct, nobody in the department want to be disrespected, and we feel this should never have happened,” Trantalis said Sunday night. Police officers fired tear gas on demonstrators who made their way onto Interstate 4 in downtown Orlando on Sunday night as several cities and counties across Florida issued nighttime curfews to curb the large crowds gathering to protest the latest killings of black people by police. Orlando Police officials tweeted that demonstrators threw rocks, bottles and construction equipment, and they were forced to temporarily close a section of the main highway that goes through the metro area Sunday night. In Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county, Mayor Carlos Gimenez said he would postpone the reopening of the county’s beaches, which had been scheduled to reopen today for the first time since March when they were closed to stem the spread of the new coronavirus. Officials said nightly curfews would continue until the threats of protests turning violent subside. In Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa, peaceful protests turned more violent at times over the weekend, with some people throwing objects at law enforcement officers dressed in riot gear. At times, police used tear gas to back the crowds up. In West Palm Beach, protesters briefly blocked Interstate 95 on Sunday. Protesters were demanding justice for George Floyd, a black man who died after pleading for air as a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed a knee on his neck last week. The officer was charged, but that hasn’t stemmed the protests happening in cities nationwide. Many protests were largely peaceful across the state Sunday with thousands gathering in Daytona Beach, Jacksonville, Stuart and Tampa. Some organizers intensified efforts to contain their demonstrations and prevent the violence.",0.0

David McAtee, known for offering meals to police officers, died early today while police officers and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew amid waves of protests over a previous police shooting in Kentucky’s largest city. Police said they were responding to gunfire from a crowd that had gathered there. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer revealed that authorities lacked body camera video for the investigation just hours after Kentucky’s governor demanded the release of police video. “This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,” Fischer said. “Accordingly, I have relieved Steve Conrad of his duties as chief of Louisville Metro Police Department.” Conrad had previously announced his resignation, which was to take effect at the end of June. Deputy police chief Robert Schroeder will step in as acting chief immediately, Fischer said. Police did retrieve video from crime center cameras that show how the shooting unfolded, Schroeder said. “It is taken from a distance, but it gives an overview of the scene and clearly shows the officers reacting to gunfire,” he said. Two Louisville officers and two Guard soldiers returned fire, he said. The two officers violated policy by not wearing or activating body cameras, Schroeder said, and have been placed on administrative leave. “That is completely unacceptable,” he said. McAtee, whose YaYa’s BBQ Shack is near where the shooting occurred, was mourned by hundreds of people who returned to the site hours afterward. Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist and executive director of the group Game Changers, said McAtee was well liked, adding: “I’ve never known him to be aggressive in any kind of way.” Schroeder agreed that McAtee was friendly to police officers. “Over the years he’s been a good friend to the police officers … frequently making sure our officers had a good meal on their shifts,” he said. Gov. Andy Beshear, who had pressed Louisville police to release video from the shooting, authorized state police to independently investigate or oversee the probe into the shooting, “It’s really important for the truth to get out there,” he said. “But I think it’s also really important in ensuring that we don’t have violence, if people can see it and know that – good, bad or ugly – we’re being absolutely transparent about it.” Before his dismissal, Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. today outside a food market on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a group of people violating the city’s curfew. Someone fired a shot at law enforcement officials, and both soldiers and officers returned fire, he said. Several “persons of interest” were being interviewed, he said. News outlets showed video taken by someone in a car parked at a gas station. It recorded the sound of bullets being fired as groups of police and National Guard soldiers crouched behind cars. Kris Smith said he was at a restaurant — “just outside having a good time, having drinks, eating barbecue” — when the soldiers arrived. “As soon as I walk to my car they jump out with the sticks, the police jump out with their sticks and their shields and stuff on,” Smith said. “It looked like something out of a movie. It looked like a freaking war zone.” He heard a loud noise, and a few minutes later gunfire erupted, he said. Smith, who is black, said the group had nothing to do with the protests. “Never thought I would experience that here in America,” he said. Last week, before the Kentucky National Guard was mobilized, seven people were wounded when gunshots erupted during a protest in downtown Louisville. Police said none of the seven, who are recovering, were shot by police. They have not announced any arrests. Protesters have been demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home. Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, pleaded for peace while demanding justice for her daughter.",0.0

Biden, the former vice president who will represent Democrats on the ballot against President Donald Trump this fall, has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his basement television studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, the 77-year-old Democrat gathered with roughly a dozen local black leaders during an intimate meeting in his hometown ahead of a virtual meeting with mayors from Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Paul, Minnesota. That low-key, high-touch approach marked a sharp contrast to that of Trump in recent days, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president was scheduled to speak to governors and law enforcement officials today, but he spent much of the weekend using Twitter as a bullhorn to urge “law and order” and tougher action by police against protesters around the country. He warned Friday that, “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump also lashed out at Biden today, tweeting that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.” In the early moments of today’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Biden’s hometown of Wilmington, the former vice president listened quietly and took notes in a spiral notebook. All of the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks. “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” said Pastor Sylvester Beaman, before Biden and those present bowed their heads in prayer. Biden’s softer approach may foreshadow how the presumptive Democratic nominee presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by the much louder, more persistent voice of Trump. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.” Reassurance requires presence, though, and that has been a hurdle for the former vice president, driven inside by the coronavirus pandemic, still working to adapt to the power of social media as a substitute and without the natural platform of a public office. Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden. Today marked just his third public appearance since the pandemic exploded in mid-March. Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veteran’s memorial near his Wilmington home last week, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in another part of the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd. “The only way to bear this pain is to turn all that anguish to purpose,” Biden wrote in a message attached to the Sunday photo. “And as President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen.” This morning’s gathering featured 15 invited religious, political and educational leaders, including Delaware Democratic Rep. Blunt Rochester. They all wore masks and spaced out among the wooden pews. Pasted notices on the main entrance cautioned people from entering if they had a cough or other symptoms that could indicate they were suffering from coronavirus. Much of Biden’s campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He’s called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump’s handling of moments of racial tension. Democrats believe the former vice president draws a contrast with Trump in such moments that works in his favor. They note that while Biden didn’t appear on television all weekend, he spoke about Floyd’s death before Trump addressed it and has shown compassion for the protesters. Trump has alternated between expressing alarm over Floyd’s death and sympathy for his family and issuing tweets antagonizing protesters and disparaging his political enemies. And in an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. And some Democrats who have criticized Biden in the past for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. “I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That’s not who he is,” said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”",0.0

For several journalists across the country, the demonstrations were taking an ominous, dangerous turn. A television reporter in Columbia, S.C., was hurt by a thrown rock Saturday and a journalist in Minneapolis was shot in the thigh by a rubber bullet. A television news photographer in Pittsburgh said he was beaten by demonstrators, and police in Louisville, Kentucky, apologized after an officer fired what appeared to be pepper bullets at a television news crew. Fox’s Leland Vittert was rattled following the Washington attack that he said was clearly targeted at his news organization. “We took a good thumping,” he told the Associated Press. A live shot he was doing was interrupted by a group of protesters who shouted obscenities directed at Fox. Flanked by two security guards, he and photographer Christian Galdabini walked away from Washington’s Lafayette Park trailed by an angry group before riot police dispersed them. Vittert said there were no markings on him or the crew’s equipment to identify them as from Fox. But he said during the demonstration, one man continually asked him who he worked for. He didn’t answer, but the man found a picture of Vittert on his cell phone and shouted to other protesters that he was from Fox. “The protesters stopped protesting whatever it was they were protesting and turned on us,” he said, “and that was a very different feeling.” He compared it to when he was chased away from a demonstration in Egypt during the Arab Spring of 2011 by a group that shouted, “Fox News hates Muslims.” A correspondent from the website The Daily Caller followed Vittert and the demonstrators as they left the park. At one point, someone took Vittert’s microphone and threw it at his back. One woman chasing him wore a t-shirt that said, “I can’t breathe,” a reference what Floyd said earlier this week when a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck. Vittert said he was “extremely grateful” to the Daily Caller for documenting the scene; Galdabini’s camera was smashed. “They were putting themselves at risk,” he said. “It makes me proud to do my job and to be a journalist,” he said. “I’m proud to be an organization that is unyielding in our coverage. We’re going to keep on telling our story and doing exactly what we’re doing.” Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media, said in a memo on Saturday that Fox was taking all necessary security precautions to protect its journalists covering the story. “We are truly living in unprecedented and transformative times and freedom of the press is a vital element to the foundation of our society,” Scott wrote. On Friday, CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his two-person crew were arrested while covering overnight protests in Minneapolis. They were quickly released, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized to CNN. CNN’s headquarters in Atlanta was damaged later Friday by a group of protesters who also fought with police and set cars afire. While police tried to keep them away from the CNN Center, demonstrators broke windows there and scrawled obscene graffiti on the network’s logo. Ian Smith, a photographer for KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh, said that he was attacked by protesters who stomped and kicked him at a demonstration there. Smith, who said other protesters jumped in to save him, posted a picture on Twitter showing him with a bruised face and bloody hand. In Louisville, WAVE-TV was on the air covering a demonstration when video showed a police officer aiming a rifle at reporter Kaitlin Rust and her crew. She was heard yelling, “I’ve been shot! I’ve been shot!” and described them as pepper bullets. Louisville Police spokeswoman Jesse Halladay apologized for the incident, and said police would review the video for potential discipline. Two Associated Press photographers have been hit by projectiles while documenting protests, one in Minneapolis on Thursday and another in Los Angeles on Friday. Neither was seriously injured. Demonstrators surrounded the police department headquarters in Columbia, S.C. on Saturday and a scuffle broke out with someone wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat. Rocks were thrown and Miranda Parnell, a television reporters from WIS-TV, was injured and taken to the hospital, according to a tweet from network anchor Judi Gatson. It was not clear who threw the rock that hit Parnell. In Minneapolis on Saturday, a Swedish journalist was shot in the thigh with a rubber bullet, apparently from a police gun, while covering a protest, according to the Norwegian newspaper VG. Later Saturday night, a CNN crew said some of its members were hit with rubber bullets.",0.0

But, he wrote in a post on Medium on Monday, the ""the small minority of folks who've resorted to violence"" at many demonstrations are ""putting innocent people at risk, compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause."" He recounted seeing an interview, where he said, ""I saw an elderly black woman being interviewed today in tears because the only grocery store in her neighborhood had been trashed. If history is any guide, that store may take years to come back. So let's not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."" The country's first African American president weighed in after the nation experienced a sixth night of protests — which in some cities turned violent — following the death of Floyd, a black man, after being kneeled on by at least one Minneapolis police officer, who has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The Democratic former president, who often admonishes people to vote, said ""we should be fighting to make sure that we have a president, a Congress, a U.S. Justice Department, and a federal judiciary that actually recognize the ongoing, corrosive role that racism plays in our society and want to do something about it."" But he wrote that the officials ""who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system"" work at the state and local levels. Mayors and county executives, Obama wrote, appoint police chiefs and negotiate with police unions, while district attorneys and state's attorneys ""decide whether or not to investigate and ultimately charge those involved in police misconduct."" All are elected positions, Obama said, which usually suffer from ""pitifully low"" voter turnout, ""especially among young people — which makes no sense given the direct impact these offices have on social justice issues, not to mention the fact that who wins and who loses those seats is often determined by just a few thousand, or even a few hundred, votes."" Obama established a task force on ""21st century policing"" in 2014 after the shooting death of Michael Brown by police in Ferguson Mo., which led to violence there. Many police and criminal justice reforms outlined by Obama and his Justice Department have been abandoned during the Trump administration. President Trump has called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" and urged state and local governments to take aggressive action to quell any violent unrest. ",0.0

Barr has directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to dispatch riot teams to the nation's capital and to Miami to assist local authorities in responding to protests there, according to a senior Justice Department official. The attorney general also sent an FBI hostage rescue team to help authorities Sunday in Washington with demonstrations, the official said, adding that the federal law enforcement presence will be ""maximized"" in the city on Monday evening. The moves come as protesters continue to take to the streets in cities across the country in outrage and grief over Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis while in police custody. Video of Floyd's arrest shows him handcuffed and pinned facedown on the street. A Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, is shown kneeling on top of him with his knee pushing on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Barr has called the outrage over Floyd's death ""real and legitimate"" but said the criminal justice system must be the venue to hold those responsible to account. And he argues that is already happening. Chauvin and three other officers involved have been fired from the police force. Minnesota authorities also have charged Chauvin with third-degree murder and manslaughter. On a parallel track, the FBI and Justice Department are conducting a separate investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated. Some of the protests against Floyd's death have turned violent and destructive. Shops in Washington, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and elsewhere have been looted, burned and destroyed. Police stations and police vehicles have been attacked. It is unclear at this point who exactly is behind the violence, but Barr and President Trump put the blame squarely on what they have labeled far-left radicals and extremists. ""Unfortunately, with the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements,"" Barr said over the weekend. ""Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda."" He said that in many places, the violence appears to be driven by ""anarchistic and far-left extremists, using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence."" It is unclear what Barr meant by ""antifa-like tactics,"" and he did not offer any evidence to support his assertions. A Justice Department official later said it was based on information provided by state and local authorities. On Sunday, the president went a step further and threatened to designate antifa a terrorist group, although experts said there is no legal authority that allows a domestic entity to be labeled a ""terrorist organization."" On top of that, antifa, short for anti-fascist, isn't an organization but rather a diffuse movement of activists on the far left. While Barr and Trump have put the blame on them, some state authorities, such as Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, have blamed white nationalists. He, too, did not offer evidence to support his assertion. For now, state and local police and other authorities are leading the law enforcement response to the protests. They make the arrests, although the FBI is conducting interviews to determine whether any federal laws — such as crossing state lines to conduct violence —have been violated. ",0.0

City and state officials deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers, enacted strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems to slow protesters’ movements, but that did little to stop parts of many cities from again erupting into mayhem. ADVERTISING Protesters in Philadelphia hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, officials said, while thieves in more than 20 California cities smashed their way into businesses and ran off with as much as they could carry — boxes of sneakers, armloads of clothes, and cellphones, TVs and other electronics. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck driver drove into a massive crowd of demonstrators nearly a week after the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. No protesters appeared to be injured, and the driver was arrested. Tensions spiked outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran away and piled up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames and people broke into banks and jewelry stores. As demonstrations persisted past curfew, Washington police said they were responding to multiple fires set around the capital. The entire Washington, D.C., National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. At least 4,100 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from looting and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. “They keep killing our people,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others in a peaceful protest through downtown Boston. “I’m so sick and tired of it.” But as night fell that demonstration also descended into violence, with some protesters throwing rocks, bricks and glass bottles at officers and lighting a police vehicle on fire. ADVERTISING In downtown Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. The pair got up and ran onto the sidewalk. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, a group broke into a Gap and a Vans sneaker store, where people walked out with boxes of shoes. Others shattered the windows of an REI outdoor supply store and snatched folding chairs, a bike and backpacks.",0.0

Following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week, more than 200 protestors created rows of slow-moving traffic on the stretch of road just south of the Henry Street intersection, accompanied by a symphony of supportive car horns and scores of signs decrying racism, injustice and police violence. “We’re in a really unique position here where we’re a minority-majority state, so we don’t experience it the same way as a lot of the rest of America does, but I think it’s important to show up and show our support no matter what,” said Ashley Lake, of Kailua-Kona. Protestors were technically in violation of COVID-19 measures, based on social distancing requirements set forth by an emergency proclamation from Gov. David Ige and adopted as part of the current Hawai‘i County policy. However, police made no arrests, wrote no citations, and gave no orders to disperse. SPONSORED VIDEO Nearly everyone lining the highway wore a face mask out of respect for current rules, and the Kailua-Kona protest was entirely peaceful — neither of which can be said for many demonstrations in mainland cities where violence and chaos have led to arson, looting, and police measures of crowd control that have included deploying tear gas and the firing of rubber bullets into groups of civilians. Reporters have also suffered through arrests and physical altercations with police in multiple instances. State and federal authorities have voiced suspicions that most of the destruction and violence characterizing protests in cities like Minneapolis, Atlanta and New York can be attributed to a small group of people who have “infiltrated” the ranks of protestors with the intent to escalate tensions — namely members of white supremacist groups and far left-wing radical political organizations. President Donald Trump painted state governors with a broad brush in a conference call Monday, calling them “weak” and telling them to “dominate” interactions with protestors, whom he referred to as “terrorists,” lest the state leaders look like “jerks” in the eyes of the public. West Hawai‘i demonstrations were subject to no such drama Sunday, as protestors spoke loudly, but respectfully, for three gray afternoon hours. Police did arrive on the scene after reports that protestors were blocking bike lanes. Reports from those in attendance varied on how many police vehicles arrived to the demonstration, with some estimating as few as six or seven and others saying it was as many as 12. “The tone definitely shifted,” Lake said of the mood upon the arrival of police. “I don’t think anybody expected the cops to show up here. The tone always shifts when people in authority show up.” Interactions between authorities and police were amicable, however, according to eye witness reports. All police vehicles had departed before, or as of, 3 p.m. Sunday. “This is just how it is in Hawai‘i,” said Yvette Kay, an organizer with the Hawai‘i chapter of the activist group Matriarchy Rising. “We don’t do violent protests here. That’s just a difference in culture.” Still, protestors in Kona said some of the outward expressions of anger seen on the mainland are understandable considering hundreds of years of racial oppression and discrimination, as well as a decades-long history of minorities dying in police custody. Derek Chauvin, one of four arresting officers, has been charged with 3rd Degree Murder and 2nd Degree Manslaughter in the death of 46-year-old George Floyd on May 25, 2020. “I think it’s not surprising, given what’s happened,” Kona protestor Lianne Yu said of the volatile developments involving mainland protests. “I also think people are frustrated with nothing changing, and they’re frustrated by the message coming from the very top — the President not addressing what’s happening and blaming all others. We need leadership that will understand and fix the problem and get to the bottom of systemic racism in our country.” Kay added that the context of COVID-19 has injected the situation with an infusion of frustration and helplessness surrounding more than 100,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the United States already, as well as a booming unemployment rate and stay-at-home orders that limited most aspects of life in parts of the country for months. She, too, criticized federal leadership decisions, namely to focus on the looting and violence that’s occurred over the last week of protests instead of what protestors believe to be the heart of the problem — the racial injustice that fueled, and ultimately lit, the social powder keg now exploding nationwide and reverberating across three continents. Big Island Now spoke to roughly a dozen protestors Sunday, but it remained unclear who specifically was responsible for organizing one of the largest protest turnouts in Kailua-Kona in years. Everyone questioned said they were made aware of the demonstration via social media, typically on Instagram or Facebook, after news of the pending protest began making the rounds online during the middle of last week. “I’m impressed with our little town for showing up as we have today,” Lake said. “I really think it’s a show of support and saying ‘not here,’ either.”",0.0

Police have cited concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. The rally has been held each year since 1990 to commemorate the lives lost in the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The Chinese military opened fire on citizens who were calling for economic and democratic reforms. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil, told the South China Morning Post that alliance members still planned to enter Victoria Park to observe a moment of silence that night. The alliance also asked the public to join an online gathering and light candles across the city. NPR's Emily Feng reported that the move to deny the demonstration comes amid controversy surrounding China's proposed national security law that could limit Hong Kong's autonomy. The potential law has concerned pro-democracy advocates, and as Feng noted, ""Legal scholars question whether Beijing has the authority to impose this law on Hong Kong."" In justifying an earlier extension of restrictions to June 4, police cited a lingering threat of the spread of the coronavirus, The Guardian reported. ""Police believe the event will not only increase participants' chances of contracting the virus, but also threaten citizens' lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others,"" police said, according to the newspaper. Lee Cheuk-yan, who chairs the alliance that organized the event, told the South China Morning Post that he believes the government was using the pandemic to shut down the demonstration. ""We believe this is totally unreasonable and unscientific, because everything is normal in Hong Kong. They are just using this excuse to suppress our rally,"" he said, adding that many other facilities had already reopened. ",0.0

Those sparks have landed in a tinderbox assembled over decades of economic inequality, now made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. Minneapolis police officers initially confronted the man — George Floyd — on suspicion that he'd used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The viral video of what followed captured an individual tragedy. But it's set against a backdrop of poverty and discrimination that have long colored relations between law enforcement and the African American community. African Americans are worse off than whites by almost every economic measure. And that divide has only deepened during the pandemic that's sent the country into its worst economic downturn in generations. A survey by the Federal Reserve last year found that even in good times, African Americans are less able to pay their monthly bills than whites or Latinos. That's hardly surprising, since median income among African Americans is 41% lower than that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks are also 40% less likely to own their homes than whites — depriving many African American families of an opportunity to build wealth. The gap in homeownership is particularly stark in Minneapolis. A study by Zillow, the online real estate company, found black homeownership in the city lags more than 50 percentage points below the white rate. ""It tells us that there's racism baked in to the housing market,"" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities. Income disparity, segregation, and racial redlining have all contributed to low national levels of homeownership among African Americans. Although blacks made housing gains in the 1990s and early 2000s, that was reversed by the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a wave of foreclosures. Before the pandemic struck, African Americans were enjoying a strong job market. The black unemployment rate in February was 5.8% — near a 50-year low, though still higher than the white rate. Since then, unemployment for all racial groups has soared to double-digits. But the black-white gap has not noticeably worsened. Loading... African Americans who are working, however, are more likely to hold jobs that put them at risk of infection. A survey by the Labor Department found that in 2018, less than 20% of African Americans held jobs they could do from home, compared to about 30% of whites. Higher risk of on-the-job exposure to the coronavirus is compounded by African Americans' higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and other conditions that are thought to contribute to more severe cases of COVID-19. ""There have been epidemics in the black community that have existed for generations before COVID,"" Perry said. ""COVID accentuated and exposed those epidemics."" Just as the pandemic puts unequal health outcomes under a microscope, the video of George Floyd's last moments illuminates the frustration brought about by generations of economic hardship. Four police officers have been fired over the incident. One — Derek Chauvin — has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin is shown pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. ""That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters,"" Perry said. ""It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities."" He suggested the demonstrations taking place across the country, five months before a national election, provide an opportunity for candidates to spell out how they would deal with these challenges. ""If we don't address the structural inequality,"" Perry said, ""we'll be right back in the same place when the next inevitable crisis hits."" : 6/03/20 A previous version of this Web story incorrectly said all four police officers present at the death of George Floyd are white. Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. AILSA CHANG, HOST: The viral video that sparked nationwide protests this weekend captured an individual tragedy - the death of a black man at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis. But George Floyd's death is set against a backdrop of economic inequality that has long shadowed race relations in this country. We're going to talk about that now for a few minutes with NPR's Scott Horsley. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: So we've been hearing an enormous amount of frustration in the last week about yet another black man dying in police custody. Can you just break down for us how economics plays into that frustration? HORSLEY: There is certainly frustration with the deadly tactics of police. But there's also frustration about the underlying circumstances that in the richest country on Earth, a man could lose his life because he's suspected of passing a counterfeit 20-dollar bill. We know that African Americans are worse off than whites in this country by almost every economic measure. Andre Perry, who studies race and inequality at the Brookings Institution, says that means blacks in general are more vulnerable to any kind of economic downturn. ANDRE PERRY: Black folk live in communities where a single economic shock can really send the entire economic hopes astray. HORSLEY: And, of course, right now, we're all living through a giant economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. CHANG: Right. HORSLEY: People throughout the country are on edge. And that has just added more dry kindling to the woodpile where this match has landed. CHANG: Well, about the pandemic - I mean, we know that African Americans have suffered disproportionate health problems during this entire outbreak. But economically, how are they faring, relatively speaking, during this time? HORSLEY: Not well. Of course, workers of all races have seen a spike in unemployment during the pandemic. The black unemployment rate has jumped into double digits, as have other rates. But the black-white gap hasn't gotten noticeably worse during the last couple of months. CHANG: Interesting. HORSLEY: We do know, however, African Americans who are working are more likely to be in essential frontline jobs. And that puts them at greater risk of infection. CHANG: So how does Minneapolis, where this all started, stack up when it comes to inequality or when it comes to discrimination? HORSLEY: The racial divide in Minneapolis is pretty stark both in terms of income and homeownership. In fact, the gap between white and black homeownership in Minneapolis is one of the largest in the country. And that matters because for a lot of families, owning a home is the main building block of wealth and stability. If blacks aren't able to buy homes, they're missing out on an important stepping stone. Nationwide, African Americans did make some gains in homeownership in the '90s and early 2000s. But those were really wiped out by the subprime mortgage crisis. And Andre Perry says that kind of structural inequality feeds into the frustration of the people who are protesting George Floyd's death. PERRY: That action really symbolized the knee on the neck of black homeowners and renters. It represents the employers who don't provide the kind of benefits and wages that will lift African American communities. HORSLEY: Now, Perry notes these demonstrations are taking place five months before a national election. And he says this is a good opportunity for policymakers to talk about how they see policing and how they would address these longstanding economic challenges. CHANG: That is NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",0.0

But some health experts, even as they urge caution, said they support the demonstrations — because racism also poses a dire health threat. Tens of thousands of people, masked and unmasked, have thronged the streets of Minneapolis, Atlanta, Louisville, Ky., and other cities in the week since George Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. They are the largest public gatherings in the U.S. since the pandemic forced widespread shutdowns, and many local officials warned of a possible spike in new cases in one or two weeks. ""Risk of transmission is lower in open spaces, but wherever there is a gathering there is still the risk of transmitting the virus,"" said Dr. Elaine Nsoesie, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University. Health experts urged protesters not to sing and shout to reduce the threat of person-to-person transmission. And they cautioned that police tactics such as tear gas and pepper spray could exacerbate the situation by prompting people to cough and gasp for air. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a list of tips for demonstrators to lower their risk of contracting COVID-19, such as covering their faces and staying in small groups. ""Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead,"" the department advised. Nsoesie said that while she agrees with the sentiment, ""I can see how some of these tips can be difficult to follow. For example, if you are angry or frustrated about an issue, you want to express that feeling, and speaking is one way of doing that."" She added, ""It's also hard to keep 6 feet of distance at a protest."" Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she's worried about how consecutive days of protests could trigger an influx of COVID-19 cases. Huge demonstrations began in the nation's capital on Friday — the same day Bowser lifted stay-at-home orders and eased shutdown rules. The city is still limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people. But in the streets around the White House, that cap is regularly exceeded by orders of magnitude. ""I'm so concerned about it that I'm urging everybody to consider their exposure if they need to isolate from their family members when they go home and if they need to be tested, because we have worked very hard to blunt the curve,"" Bowser said on NBC's Meet the Press. But the risks of congregating during a global pandemic shouldn't keep people from protesting racism, according to dozens of public health and disease experts who signed an open letter in support of the protests. ""White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19,"" the letter said. Initially written by infectious disease experts at the University of Washington, the letter cited a number of systemic problems, from the disproportionately high rate at which black people have been killed by police in the U.S. to disparities in life expectancy and other vital categories — including black Americans' higher death rate from the coronavirus. ""Data is showing that blacks and Latinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in many states,"" said Nsoesie, who was not among the letter's signatories when NPR contacted her. ""Racism is one of the reasons this disparity exists."" She continued, ""Racism is a social determinant of health. It affects the physical and mental health of blacks in the U.S. So I wouldn't weigh these crises separately."" Local governments should not break up crowded demonstrations ""under the guise of maintaining public health,"" the experts said in their open letter. They urged law enforcement agencies not to use tear gas, smoke and other irritants, saying they could make people more susceptible to infection and worsen existing health conditions. The medical professionals also acknowledged the potential for COVID-19 cases to rise in the days to come, and they called for public health agencies to boost access to care and testing in affected communities.

The competing messages — one conciliatory, one bellicose — came as the U.S. braced for another round of violence at a time when the country is already buckling because of the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. “We are a country that is scared. We are a country that is angry,” said Sam Page, county executive in St. Louis County, Missouri, where the city of Ferguson has been synonymous with the Black Lives Matter movement since the 2014 death of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old, in a clash with a white officer. “And we are a country that is holding out for the promise of justice for all.” In Minneapolis, Floyd’s brother, Terrence, made an emotional plea at the site where Floyd was pinned to the pavement by an officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck until he stopped breathing. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,"" Terrence Floyd said. The crowd chanted, “What’s his name? George Floyd!” and “One down, three to go!” in reference to the four officers involved in Floyd's arrest. Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. The gathering was part rally and part impromptu eulogy as Floyd urged people to stop the violence and use their power at the ballot box. “If I’m not over here messing up my community, then what are you all doing?” he said. “You all are doing nothing. Because that’s not going to bring my brother back at all.” The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred in part by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump's comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” Meanwhile, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. That distinguishes it from the official autopsy, which said he died from the effects of being restrained along with underlying health problems and potential intoxicants in his system. The official autopsy found nothing “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” The second autopsy was done by a doctor who also examined the body of Eric Garner, a New York man who died in an officer’s chokehold six years ago. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man, Matthew Lee Rupert, saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. The video also showed him attempting to light a business on fire, and looting, according to an FBI affidivit. Early Sunday, he posted more videos of himself in and around Chicago, saying “let’s start a riot.” He was arrested in Chicago for violating the city's curfew. As they girded for more violence, Washington and New York joined other cities in announcing curfews. The move followed a chaotic Sunday night in New York, where groups broke into Chanel, Prada and Rolex boutiques and electronics stores. Hours before Washington's 7 p.m. curfew was to go into effect, nearly a dozen National Guard vehicles rumbled through the White House grounds and exited opposite Lafayette Park, where crowds had gathered for another night of protests. On Sunday, police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of protesters in the park. They scattered to light fires in nearby streets. At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis. While police in places tried to ease tensions by kneeling or marching in solidarity with the demonstrators, officers around the country were accused of treating protesters with the same kind of heavy-handed tactics that contributed to the unrest in the first place. Cities struggled to keep police in line. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an officer was suspended for pushing a kneeling woman to the ground during a protest. In Atlanta, two officers were fired after bashing in the window of a car and using a stun gun on the occupants. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters, knocking two people to the ground. In New York, the police commissioner said about six incidents were being investigated by the department’s internal affairs bureau, including a weekend confrontation in Brooklyn in which two police vehicles appeared to plow through a group of protesters. In another incident, an officer pointed a gun at protesters, drawing condemnation from the mayor. “I think some of the actions of the NYPD have exacerbated the anger,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. “There are videos of some NYPD actions that are very disturbing. There are videos of NYPD cars driving into a crowd that are very disturbing. Pulling a mask down off a person to pepper spray them. Throwing a woman to the ground. It’s on video! It’s on video!”",0.0

Trump's Rose Garden remarks came as just across the street, law enforcement officers deployed tear gas and shot rubber bullets to forcefully disperse peaceful protesters. Washington, D.C., had set a curfew Monday of 7 p.m. ET. The protesters were removed from the Lafayette Square area across from the White House, apparently to clear the way for the president to walk to St. John's Church, where he posed briefly for photographers, holding a Bible. Parts of the church compound were damaged by rioters on Sunday night. In a statement, Judd Deere, the White House's deputy press secretary, said: ""The perimeter was expanded to help enforce the 7 p.m. curfew in the same area where rioters attempted to burn down one of our nation's most historic churches the night before. Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police."" Trump's remarks, which lasted less than seven minutes, came after days of protests in dozens of cities across the U.S. following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis a week ago. During the remarks, Trump declared himself ""a law-and-order president"" and ""ally of all peaceful protesters,"" but he called violent unrest that has accompanied many demonstrations ""acts of domestic terror."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life, and the spilling of innocent blood, is an offense to humanity and a crime against God,"" Trump said. He added: ""Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence."" Trump said he had mobilized ""thousands and thousands"" of ""heavily armed"" military personnel to put an end to the protests, which were born from criticisms of excessive force by law enforcement. It was not immediately clear, however, what precise changes might be in store for the personnel who have been responding to the demonstrations across the country. The Justice Department said in a statement that beginning Monday night, it had deployed all of its law enforcement components and is coordinating with the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and local authorities to ""maximize federal security presence throughout the District [of Columbia]."" Threatening state governors who have declined to deploy the National Guard, Trump said he would dispatch the U.S. military to ""quickly solve the problem for them."" After the stop at St. John's Church, Trump and a retinue of advisers and staffers then returned to the secure enclave within the White House complex. Nation in crisis Protests, which have at times broken out into violence and looting, continued from the weekend into Monday, following the video-recorded death of Floyd, who died after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protesters — many of whom have worn masks because of the coronavirus pandemic — have demanded that the officers involved be held accountable for Floyd's death. Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers who were involved in the incident have been fired but have not been charged. Several major cities, including Washington, D.C., were placed under curfews following the unrest. Trump's walk to the nearby church, which he does not typically visit, technically violated the District of Columbia's Monday curfew for a little time. The National Guard has been deployed in many states, and the president on Monday called for governors to ""dominate"" in their states to put an end to the protests. His remarks Monday stand in stark contrast to the position he took toward heavily armed majority-white protesters last month, who stormed the Michigan statehouse in defiance of stay-at-home orders to demand a reopening of the state economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump described those protesters as ""very good people"" and called on the governor to ""give a little"" to appease them. The protests against police violence come against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S., with black Americans disproportionately affected.

As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the White House's idyllic Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Those peaceful demonstrators were cleared so Trump could walk across the park to St. John’s Episcopal Church, known as “The Church of the Presidents,” which suffered fire damage in a protest this week. Holding a Bible, he then stood with several of his Cabinet members as the cameras clicked. “We have the greatest country in the world,"" Trump declared. “We're going to keep it safe."" Trump said he would mobilize “thousands and thousands"" of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park. The escalation came just after Attorney General William Barr came to the park to to survey the demonstrators. According to senior defense officials, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were being sent to Washington to provide assistance. Those troops were either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people. In extreme cases, however, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, also from the Civil War, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement. The officials said that some of the National Guard in D.C. will be armed and others will not. They said that the D.C. guard members do not have non-lethal weapons. The military police that are visible in the city are members of the Guard. ——————- THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's original story is below. —————————————— President Donald Trump on Monday derided many governors as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on burning and stealing among some demonstrations in the aftermath of violent protests in dozens of American cities. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference that also included law enforcement and national security officials, telling the state leaders they “have to get much tougher."" “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” The days of protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. The demonstrations turned violent in several cities, with people trashing stores, smashing and burning police cars and igniting fires in historic Lafayette Park across from the White House. Accused by critics of doing too little to defuse the crisis, Trump was to address the nation early Monday evening. The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again,” said Trump. “We’re doing it in Washington, D.C. We’re going to do something that people haven’t seen before."" The president told the governors they were making themselves “look like fools” for not calling up more of the National Guard as a show for force on city streets. Attorney General Bill Barr, who was also on the call, told governors that a joint terrorist task force would be used to track agitators and urged local officials to “dominate” the streets and control, not react to crowds. He urged the governors to “go after troublemakers.” Trump's angry exhortations at the nation's governors came after a Sunday night of escalating violence, images of fires and looting and clashes with police filling the nation's airwaves and overshadowing the largely peaceful protests. The protests had grown so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground bunker previously used during terrorist attacks. On Monday, Trump also spoke of trying to criminalize flag-burning. The Supreme Court has conservative new members since it last ruled on that issue, and Trump said that “I think it's time to review that again.” He continued his effort to project strength, using inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks. As cities have burned night after night and images of violence have dominated television coverage, Trump’s advisers have discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president’s own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity. Trump did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to on Monday either. The demonstrations in Washington appeared to catch officers by surprise. They sparked one of the highest alerts at the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service. Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening. Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force. “This isn’t going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,” Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president. In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police. The Justice Department deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",0.0

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump’s bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. >> PHOTO GALLERY: Trump visits St. John’s Church as protests continue near White House If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters today to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House tonight appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John’s Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” “It’s all just a reality TV show for this president,” he said on Twitter. “Shameful.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. Today, police fired tear gas at hundreds of protesters who spilled onto an interstate highway in the heart of Philadelphia just before a 6 p.m. curfew took effect. >> Democratic governors reject Trump’s call to send in military Today, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. today, rioters got through the doors of the city’s flagship Macy’s store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier today, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd’s brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also today, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But today, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press.",0.0

The employees, who said they refused to work in order to show their support for demonstrators across the country, added an automated message to their digital profiles and email responses saying that they were out of the office in a show of protest. The protest group — conducting a virtual “walkout” of sorts because most Facebook employees are working from home because of the coronavirus pandemic — was one of a number of clusters of employees pressing Facebook executives to take a tougher stand on Trump’s posts. Inside the company, staff members have circulated petitions and threatened to resign, and a number of employees wrote publicly about their unhappiness on Twitter and elsewhere. More than a dozen current and former employees have described the unrest as the most serious challenge to the leadership of Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, since the company was founded 15 years ago. “The hateful rhetoric advocating violence against black demonstrators by the US President does not warrant defense under the guise of freedom of expression,” one Facebook employee wrote in an internal message board, according to a copy of the text viewed by The New York Times. The employee added: “Along with Black employees in the company, and all persons with a moral conscience, I am calling for Mark to immediately take down the President’s post advocating violence, murder and imminent threat against Black people.” Zuckerberg has argued on a number of occasions that Facebook should take a hands-off approach to what people post, including lies from elected officials and others in power. He has repeatedly said the public should be allowed to decide what to believe. That stand was tested last week when Twitter added fact-check and warning labels to two tweets from the president that broke Twitter’s rules around voter suppression and glorification of violence. But as Twitter acted on Trump’s tweets, Facebook left them alone. Zuckerberg said Trump’s posts did not violate the social network’s rules. “Personally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric,” Zuckerberg said in a post to his Facebook page Friday. “But I’m responsible for reacting not just in my personal capacity but as the leader of an institution committed to free expression.” In response to the walkout, Zuckerberg has moved his weekly meeting with employees to Tuesday, rather than Thursday. The meeting will be a chance for employees to question Zuckerberg directly on his decision. A Facebook spokeswoman said this morning that executives welcomed feedback from employees. “We recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our black community,” said Liz Bourgeois, the spokeswoman. “We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership.” Zuckerberg’s post last week explaining his decision on Trump’s tweets frustrated many inside the company. More than a dozen Facebook employees tweeted that they disagreed with Zuckerberg’s decision, including the head of design of Facebook’s portal product, Andrew Crow. An engineer for the platform, Lauren Tan, posted about the situation Friday. “Facebook’s inaction in taking down Trump’s post inciting violence makes me ashamed to work here,” Tan wrote in a tweet. “Silence is complicity.” Two senior Facebook employees told The New York Times that they had informed their managers that they would resign if Zuckerberg did not reverse his decision. Another person, who was supposed to start work at the company next month, told Facebook they were no longer willing to accept a position at the company because of Zuckerberg’s decision. Over the weekend, several petitions circulated among Facebook employees calling for the company to make personnel changes and for more diversity of voices among Zuckerberg’s top lieutenants. In private online chats, employees have called for the resignation of Joel Kaplan, Facebook’s vice president of global policy. Kaplan is seen as being a strong conservative voice within the company. In 2018, he upset some employees when he sat in the front row of the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was a close friend. Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist who was an early investor in Facebook but in recent years has turned into an aggressive critic of the company, said Facebook’s decision to leave Trump’s posts alone was typical of a longtime pattern of behavior among big social media companies. “Internet platforms that are pervasive — as Facebook and Google are globally — must always align with power, including authoritarians. It is a matter of self-preservation,” McNamee said. “Facebook has been a key tool for authoritarians in Brazil, the Philippines, Cambodia and Myanmar. In the U.S., Facebook has consistently ignored or altered its terms of service to the benefit of Trump. Until last week, Twitter did the same thing.” Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the company’s chief operating officer, planned to host a call Monday evening with civil rights leaders who have lashed out publicly against Facebook’s protection of Trump’s posts. The call was expected to include Vanita Gupta of the National Leadership Conference, Rashad Robinson of Color of Change and Sherrilyn Ifill of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. The civil rights leaders said they would push back on Zuckerberg’s position on Trump’s posts, which they see as violations of Facebook’s community standards that do not permit voter suppression or the incitement of violence, even by political figures. “It’s really important for Mark Zuckerberg to contend with the fact that he is prioritizing free expression while our democracy is literally burning,” said Gupta, who organized the call with the executives. On Sunday, Zuckerberg wrote that he would be donating $10 million to groups working on racial justice. The move, coupled with his earlier post expressing solidarity with the demonstrators, did little to quell the internal protest. Robinson, the civil rights group leader, said Facebook’s financial pledge was “one of the most insulting things I’ve ever seen.” The donation of money, he said, doesn’t change Facebook’s policy of protecting Trump’s comments that contain falsehoods and appear to violate the company’s policies against hate speech and inciting violence. Facebook executives have long acknowledged that the company has failed to attract a diverse workforce. “There’s a long history of Facebook, as a company, not seeing or being responsive to black employees,” said Mark Luckie, who quit the company in 2018 and published a memo titled “Facebook is failing its black employees and its black users.” Like many Silicon Valley companies, Facebook had a severe lack of diversity, especially among executives, Luckie said in an interview. “When you don’t have a diverse group of people at the top of the company you don’t understand the issues involved or why your employees are upset.” In 2014, 2% of Facebook’s employees were black. In 2019, that number had increased to 3.8%, according to the company’s diversity report.",0.0

The crowds on Interstate 676 also led to the closure of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, the main link from downtown Philadelphia to New Jersey suburbs. Some climbed a steep embankment and scaled a fence as police acted. More than two dozen were arrested as a few hundred other protesters moved to block the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, a grand thoroughfare leading from downtown to the city’s imposing art museum. The confrontation came after the National Guard stationed vehicles outside City Hall and other downtown buildings, officials curtailed public transit, and city leaders put a curfew in effect for a third day today after a weekend of destruction that led to over 400 arrests. A few hundred protesters were forced down Benjamin Franklin Parkway toward City Hall after the interstate demonstration. Many went to the Police Department headquarters known as the Round House on Arch Street, where a line of National Guard members and police officers stood watch on the stairs. Shortly before 7 p.m., a little more than half decided to take a knee as a sign to protesters. Many cheered and video taped the officers on one knee at the top of the stairs. Afterward, many of the protesters left, but others unsure of what to do, slowly milled about outside the station. Today’s curfew was 6 p.m., the same as the day before and two hours earlier than Saturday. The city closed most services and business in the center city, including a noon shutdown of all downtown bus, trolley and subway stops. Protesters — like others across the country, inspired by the death last week of George Floyd, a black man who was pinned by a Minneapolis officer who put his knee on the handcuffed man’s neck — chanted “Let him go” after an arrest that was captured in videos posted online as relations between a crowd and police near Philadelphia’s convention center grew tense. On a call with governors today before the confrontation on the interstate, President Donald Trump singled out Philadelphia, where as of this morning destruction had been on par with that in some other major cities. “Philadelphia is a mess. Philadelphia, what happened there is horrible. And that was on television. They’re breaking into stores and nobody showed up to even stop them,” Trump said. Mayor Jim Kenney responded, saying Trump has not been helpful during the protests. Kenney also said he wasn’t prepared to speculate on whether the protests and their aftermath would change the city’s plan to ease restrictions on businesses and other stay-at-home-orders by entering into the state’s “yellow phase” of coronavirus recovery Friday. “I’m not saying no, but I’m not saying yes either,” Kenney said. About 50 National Guard members arrived in the city early today, and about 50 more were expected soon, U.S. Attorney William McSwain said. Protests also erupted across the state, including in Lancaster, Erie, Reading, Chambersburg and Bethlehem. Lancaster officials said today that they had evidence white nationalists had instigated the violence at a weekend rally there that had a few instances of bottles of cayenne pepper and other projectiles thrown at police. McSwain’s office is investigating whether any crimes would fall under his federal jurisdiction, he and U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican, said at a news conference. “We are looking into who are the real agitators,” McSwain said. Police in Erie charged eight people after attacks on police and attempts to set fires at three downtown businesses Saturday. The Erie Times-News reported that assaults or attempted assaults on police involved bricks, frozen water bottles, fireworks and a Molotov cocktail. In Philadelphia, a fire late Sunday that appeared to have started at a Rent-A-Center in the Kensington neighborhood caused parts of several stores and apartment buildings to collapse, Fire Commissioner Adam Thiel said. Nearly two dozen police officers were injured over two nights, including one who was hit by a fleeing vehicle and is hospitalized with broken ribs and a broken arm, said John McNesby, president of a Philadelphia police union. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said police made 429 arrests from Saturday to early today, a number expected to grow. The city normally gets about 3,000 calls for police service, Kenney said, but got about 18,000 on Sunday. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” Outlaw said.",0.0

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he doesn’t believe the federal government can send military troops into his state. He accused the president of creating an “incendiary moment” by threatening to do just that to quell violence that has arisen as demonstrators have taken to the streets in reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois,” Pritzker said on CNN after Trump urged governors to deploy the Guard. If they did not, he said he would send in “thousands and thousands” of soldiers. Pritzker was among the first governors to react to Trump’s comments, which came hours after the president called governors “weak” and urged them to take a more aggressive response to weekend violence. It came as Americans gathered to protest police brutality against black Americans following the killing of Floyd, who was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with people breaking into and stealing from businesses, smashing car windows and setting fires. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not deployed the state’s National Guard to New York City, although he said earlier today the state had 13,000 troops that “we can use at any moment.” “I say thank you but no thank you,” Cuomo said on CNN about Trump’s call to send military troops to the states. At least 23 states and the District of Columbia had already deployed guard troops as of this morning, according to a statement from the National Guard. It wasn’t clear whether the action would be enough to satisfy the president. Trump took no questions from reporters and did not say how he would decide whether a state’s response was sufficient. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has activated the state’s guard, said in a statement he prays “no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.” “This president has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office,” Inslee said in a statement. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat, said any suggestions the state’s National Guard is ill equipped to handle the states needs is “misinformed.” “As the Commander In Chief of the Nevada National Guard I can state, categorically, that they have done their duty to protect all Nevadans, and will continue to do so.” In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of demonstrators. She refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation, but today activated 50 unarmed guard members in support roles. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” Brown, a Democrat, said earlier today in reaction to Trump’s comments about governors being weak in their response. “Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform.” She didn’t immediately comment on Trump’s remarks about deploying the U.S. military. Nor did California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has deployed thousands of guard troops to Los Angeles and other cities. He called Trump’s morning comments “noise” and avoided addressing them directly, although he said the nation is desperate for leadership. Guard members can assist law enforcement and perform duties such as traffic control, communications support and extinguishing fires.",0.0
1622831852,2020-06-01 23:29:00,Misinformation about George Floyd protests surges online,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/06/01/breaking-news/misinformation-about-george-floyd-protests-surges-online/,en,False,"politics and government, computers and the internet, finances, news and news media, media, demonstrations and riots",39573,HonululuAdvertiser,http://www.staradvertiser.com/,"On Twitter and Facebook, hundreds of posts are circulating saying that George Floyd is not actually dead. Conspiracy theorists are baselessly arguing that George Soros, the billionaire investor and Democratic donor, is funding the spreading protests against police brutality. And conservative commentators are asserting with little evidence that antifa, the far-left antifascism activist movement, coordinated the riots and looting that sprang from the protests. Untruths, conspiracy theories and other false information are running rampant online as the furor over Floyd, an African American man who was killed last week in police custody in Minneapolis, has built. The misinformation has surged as the protests have dominated conversation, far outpacing the volume of online posts and media mentions about last year’s protests in Hong Kong and Yellow Vest movement in France, according to the media insights company Zignal Labs. At its peak Friday, Floyd and the protests around his death were mentioned 8.8 million times, said Zignal Labs, which analyzed global television broadcasts and social media. In contrast, news of the Hong Kong protests reached 1.5 million mentions a day and the Yellow Vest movement 941,000. “The combination of evolving events, sustained attention and, most of all, deep existing divisions make this moment a perfect storm for disinformation,” said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “All of it is toxic, and make our very real challenges and divisions harder to address.” The collision of racial tensions and political polarization during the coronavirus pandemic has supersized the misinformation, researchers said. Much of it is being shared by the conspiracy group QAnon and far-right commentators as well as by those on the left, Brookie said. President Donald Trump himself has stoked the divisive information. Over the last few days, he posted on Twitter that antifa was a “Terrorist Organization” and urged the public to show up for a “MAGA Night” counterprotest at the White House. Along with that, people are experiencing high levels of fear, uncertainty and anger, said Claire Wardle, executive director of First Draft, an organization that fights online disinformation. That creates “the worst possible context for a healthy information environment,” she said. Twitter and Facebook did not immediately have a comment. Here are three significant categories of falsehoods that have surfaced on social media platforms about Floyd’s death and the protests. George Floyd’s ‘Fake’ Death The unfounded rumor that Floyd is alive is emblematic of the misinformation narrative that a newsworthy event was staged. This has become an increasingly common refrain over the years, with conspiracy theorists saying, among other examples, that the 1969 moon landing and the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School were hoaxes. On Friday, the YouTube conspiracy channel JonXArmy shared a 22-minute video that falsely asserted Floyd’s death had been faked. The video was shared nearly 100 times on Facebook, mostly in groups run by QAnon, reaching 1.3 million people, according to data from CrowdTangle, a tool that analyzes interactions across social media. Jon Miller, who runs the JonXArmy channel, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. YouTube said on its site that it had removed the video, citing its policy on hate speech. On Twitter, posts stating that “George Floyd is not dead” were also tweeted hundreds of times over the last week, with the phrase peaking at 15 mentions in a 10-minute span this morning, according to Dataminr, a social media monitoring service. In thousands of other posts on Facebook and Twitter, people falsely stated that Derek Chauvin, the Minnesota police officer who was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death, was an actor and that the entire incident had been faked by the deep state. The George Soros Conspiracy The false idea that Soros funded the protests spiked on social media over the last week, showing how new events can resurrect old conspiracy theories. Soros has for years been cast as an anti-conservative villain by a loose network of activists and political figures on the right and has become a convenient boogeyman for all manner of ills. On Twitter, Soros was mentioned in 34,000 tweets in connection with Floyd’s death over the last week, according to Dataminr. Over 90 videos in five languages mentioning Soros conspiracies were also posted to YouTube over the last seven days, according to an analysis by The New York Times. On Facebook, 72,000 posts mentioned Soros in the last week, up from 12,600 the week before, according to The Times’ analysis. Of the 10 most engaged posts about Soros on the social network, nine featured false conspiracies linking him to the unrest. They were collectively shared over 110,000 times. Farshad Shadloo, a YouTube spokesman, said that the Soros conspiracy videos did not violate the company’s guidelines but that the site was not recommending them. A spokeswoman for Soros said, “We deplore the false notion that the people taking to the streets to express their anguish are paid, by George Soros or anyone else.” Antifa Misinformation The unsubstantiated theory that antifa activists are responsible for the riots and looting was the biggest piece of protest misinformation tracked by Zignal Labs, which looked at certain categories of falsehoods. Of 873,000 pieces of misinformation linked to the protests, 575,800 were mentions of antifa, Zignal Labs said. The antifa narrative gained traction because “long-established networks of hyperpartisan social media influencers now work together like a well-oiled machine,” said Erin Gallagher, a social media researcher. That began when Trump tweeted Sunday that “ANTIFA led anarchists” and “Radical Left Anarchists” were to blame for the unrest, without providing specifics. Then he called antifa “a Terrorist Organization.” Dan Bongino, a conservative political commentator who has unsuccessfully run for a House seat several times, then took up the call. On the “Fox and Friends” television show today, Bongino said antifa activists were responsible for a “sophisticated” attack on the White House and called it an “insurrection.” He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Those assertions soon spread around social media.

And then it became clear. President Trump wanted to walk from the White House through the park to the Episcopal church. Camera crews scrambled to keep up with him as he strode through the park, followed by his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, along with Attorney General William Barr and other administration officials. Trump stopped briefly outside the church and held up a Bible. ""We have the greatest country in the world,"" he said. ""Keep it nice and safe."" The visit came just after Trump delivered remarks at the White House, declaring himself ""your president of law and order"" and demanding that governors deploy National Guard units and ""dominate the streets."" St. John's Church opened in 1816 and is known as ""the Church of the Presidents,"" having hosted every U.S. president since James Madison. On this occasion, however, the president's visit was unannounced, and church authorities were furious that the White House did not bother to alert them. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" said the Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, Episcopal bishop of Washington, with oversight responsibilities for the church. When the president held up the Bible, without praying or quoting a verse appropriate for the moment, Budde was further incensed. ""It almost looked like a prop,"" she told NPR. ""That is the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition. It speaks messages of love, of God, love of neighbor. I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way."" The church has long been known for its support of social justice causes, and in the hours before the president showed up, clergy and lay volunteers had been ministering to the protesters in the plaza. Protests, some of them violent, had occurred around the church on previous nights, and the church was briefly in danger on Sunday after a fire started in the church basement. The Bible teaches us to love God and our neighbor; that all people are beloved children of God; that we are to do justice and love kindness. The President used our sacred text as a symbol of division. — Mariann Budde (@Mebudde) June 2, 2020 A former St. John's minister, Gini Gerbasi, was among those attending to the protesters in front of the church when the police moved in. ""We were literally DRIVEN OFF of the St. John's, Lafayette Square patio with tear gas and concussion grenades and police in full riot gear,"" she wrote in a Facebook post. ""PEOPLE WERE HURT SO THAT [President Trump] COULD HAVE A PHOTO OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH!!! HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO STEP OVER THE MEDICAL SUPPLIES WE LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE WE WERE BEING TEAR GASSED!!!!"" In a statement Monday evening, the Episcopal Church Presiding Bishop Michael Curry joined in the criticism of Trump's visit. ""This evening, the President of the United States stood in front of St. John's Episcopal Church, lifted up a bible, and had pictures of himself taken,"" Curry said. ""In so doing, he used a church building and the Holy Bible for partisan political purposes. This was done in a time of deep hurt and pain in our country, and his action did nothing to help us or to heal us."" The church visit was praised, however, by a member of Trump's Evangelical Advisory Board, the Rev. Johnnie Moore. ""I will never forget seeing @POTUS @realDonaldTrump slowly & in-total-command walk from the @WhiteHouse across Lafayette Square to St. John's Church defying those who aim to derail our national healing by spreading fear, hate & anarchy,"" Moore tweeted.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he doesn't believe the federal government can send military troops into his state. He accused the president of creating an “incendiary moment” by threatening to do just that to quell violence that has arisen as demonstrators have taken to the streets in reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “I reject the notion that the federal government can send troops into the state of Illinois,"" Pritzker said on CNN after Trump urged governors to deploy the Guard. If they did not, he said he would send in “thousands and thousands” of soldiers. Pritzker was among the first governors to react to Trump's comments, which came hours after the president called governors “weak” and urged them to take a more aggressive response to weekend violence. It came as Americans gathered to protest police brutality against black Americans following the killing of Floyd, who was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. Some demonstrations have turned violent, with people breaking into and stealing from businesses, smashing car windows and setting fires. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not deployed the state's National Guard to New York City, although he said earlier Monday the state had 13,000 troops that “we can use at any moment.” “I say thank you but no thank you,"" Cuomo said on CNN about Trump's call to send military troops to the states. At least 23 states and the District of Columbia had already deployed guard troops as of Monday morning, according to a statement from the National Guard. It wasn't clear whether the action would be enough to satisfy the president. Trump took no questions from reporters and did not say how he would decide whether a state's response was sufficient. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has activated the state's guard, said in a statement he prays “no soldier and no civilian is injured or killed by this reckless fit.” “This president has repeatedly proven he is incapable of governing and shown nothing but false bravado throughout the chaos that has accompanied his time in office,"" Inslee said in a statement. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat, said any suggestions the state's National Guard is ill equipped to handle the states needs is “misinformed.” ""As the Commander In Chief of the Nevada National Guard I can state, categorically, that they have done their duty to protect all Nevadans, and will continue to do so.” In neighboring Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown said the violence is being perpetrated by a small segment of demonstrators. She refused to deploy the National Guard on Sunday at Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler’s request because she was concerned it would escalate a tense situation. “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” Brown, a Democrat, said earlier Monday in reaction to Trump's comments about governors being weak in their response. “Trump wants governors to deploy the National Guard as a show of force to intimidate the public. I want to ensure that the public can safely raise their voices in this much-needed call for reform.” She didn't immediately comment on Trump's remarks about deploying the U.S. military. Nor did California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has deployed thousands of guard troops to Los Angeles and other cities. He called Trump's morning comments “noise” and avoided addressing them directly, although he said the nation is desperate for leadership. Guard members can assist law enforcement and perform duties such as traffic control, communications support and extinguishing fires.",0.0

Some showed up only hours after taking part in demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, a black man pinned to the ground by a white Minneapolis police officer who pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes. Many said cleaning felt cathartic during a dark period for a nation battling the coronavirus pandemic, the job losses that followed and now the worst racial unrest in half a century. Bill Stuehler donned a mask Sunday and marched with a fellow nurse and other activists in Los Angeles, later trying to stop young people from breaking into stores and stealing. At home, he kept watching the violence on live feeds and fell deeper into despair. So before sunrise, the 66-year-old grabbed brooms, a rake and a trash shovel and drove to nearby Long Beach to clean up the mess. Soon, more than 2,000 people were working side by side, scrubbing, filling trash containers and repairing what they could in the hard-hit city south of Los Angeles. “It was pretty amazing to see the number of people turn out for the community,” Stuehler said. “It restored the faith in humanity that I had lost last night.” Throngs of people nationwide volunteered to help businesses — from small shops to major chains — bounce back from the damage, though some stores had burned to the ground and another night of unrest was expected. In New Jersey, Chris DeLeon, broom in hand, arrived at 8 a.m. with dozens of other people to sweep up broken glass in the capital of Trenton. The 34-year-old had protested Sunday, then decided to help clean up after seeing videos of people smashing windows. “It just goes to show there’s at least as many good people as there are other folks out there,” DeLeon said. In Wisconsin, volunteers in Milwaukee and Madison turned up for a second day to clean up damage from the night before. Countless businesses already had taken a hit from restrictions designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus and were starting to reopen just as the protests led to more expensive setbacks: vandalism and stolen merchandise. The owner of the Laugh Factory’s club in Long Beach discovered broken windows and doors, computers smashed and memorabilia stolen, including Three Stooges posters and autographed photos of Redd Foxx and other late comedians. Workers boarded up windows and swept up broken glass Monday. Owner Jamie Masada was offering an unspecified reward to anyone who returns the memorabilia. “It is not worth anything to them but it means a lot to me,” Masada said, because it’s tied to those who represent “the height of comedy.’” In Sacramento, two-thirds of the capital city’s 600 downtown properties took a hit, with more than 200 broken windows, 330 pieces of graffiti, and more than 50 cases of “significant property damage,” said Michael Ault, executive director of the Downtown Sacramento Partnership. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said she didn’t recognize downtown when she walked through it Sunday, “but what I did recognize were the hundreds of volunteers and residents who came because they love Seattle.” Stuehler found the same community spirit in Long Beach. A nurse who had been treating COVID-19 patients, Stuehler took the month off when he joined the protest. He said a small percentage of people vandalized businesses but “the horror of the opportunism, the rage, the disregard for logic and reason — it was shocking.” They had an outsize impact that detracts from the message of overhauling police agencies, Stuehler said. But he said he’s feeling revived after seeing so many people work together. Alycia Barber also was moved to help after watching from her Long Beach apartment as people smashed windows and police doused the crowds with pepper spray Sunday. The 22-year-old got up early and joined others organizing clothing and jewelry strewn inside a Forever 21 store, hours after thieves made off with armloads of merchandise. Few of the volunteers knew each other; they just showed up, she said. There were parents with children, senior citizens, college students. One woman brought paint and brooms so people could paint over graffiti on the outside wall of a parking garage. “I just feel so helpful today,” Barber said, adding that she supports the fight against racial injustice. “But now we also want to get up and make the world a beautiful place for people.” ——— Watson reported from San Diego.

1622920825,2020-06-01 15:05:00,‘Hate just hides’: Biden vows to take on systematic racism,https://www.thegardenisland.com/2020/06/01/news/hate-just-hides-biden-vows-to-take-on-systematic-racism/,en,False,"politics and government, united states politics and government, elections, presidents and presidency (us), blacks, election issues",67509,thegardenisland.com,http://thegardenisland.com/#spider,"WILMINGTON, Del. — Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support. “Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke. Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he’d be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital” and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.” Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March. His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.” Biden’s softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump’s much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.” Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer. Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans’ memorial near his Wilmington home last week, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd. In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke. “The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer. Biden’s standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden’s flailing primary campaign, but it’s unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,” Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.” Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he’s going to send the military into our communities but hadn’t mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden’s campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump’s handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in. Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now. “I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That’s not who he is,” said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.” ——— Jaffe reported from Washington; Peoples reported from Montclair, New Jersey. ——— Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, “Ground Game.”",0.0

The civil unrest combined with the COVID-19 crisis that’s disproportionately striking African Americans sparked an urgent plea for understanding from some leaders as the world watches a nation in turmoil. Notably, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell read into the Senate record the names of black people who have died at the hands of the police. George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery. Breonna Taylor. “To me,” McConnell, R-Ky., said in a speech in the Senate chamber, and to “millions of outraged Americans, these disturbing events do not look like three isolated incidents. They look more like the latest chapter in our national struggle to make equal just and equal protection under the law a fact of life for all Americans.” As protesters gathered outside the Capitol, still partly locked down due to the coronavirus, the dual crises tested Washington. Some lawmakers urged comity and federal aid to prevent the country from slipping into further conflict. Others sided with President Donald Trump’s threat to use military force if necessary to end the protests. House and Senate lawmakers swiftly began drafting legislation to address police violence and confront the inequities facing black Americans. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., proposed a sweeping overhaul of law enforcement procedures. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., pushed to establish the first U.S. Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation, backed by a civil rights icon, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. “The murder of George Floyd and the current COVID-19 crisis illustrate once again the painful and dangerous legacy that white supremacy has had in our country,” Lee said in introducing the measure. “This inequality is at the heart of every crisis we’re dealing with right now.” Even some conservatives who in the past have countered “Black Lives Matter” protests with “Blue Lives Matter” support for law enforcement acknowledged the concerns. After countless incidents of police being called to investigate black people doing ordinary things — most recently when a white woman in New York summoned 911 over an African American bird watcher in Central Park — many lawmakers agreed public attitudes and police tactics need review. Yet, some Trump allies pushed for a show of military action to quell the protests now stretching into their sixth day. “Anarchy, rioting, and looting needs to end tonight,” tweeted Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. He suggested bringing in the 101st Airborne — an elite Army unit — to confront outside agitators influencing the protests. “We need to have zero tolerance,” he said. McConnell also suggested the civil unrest “has to end.” “If state and local leaders cannot or will not secure the peace and protect citizens and their property, I hope the federal government is ready to stand in the breech,” McConnell said. The protests hit a nation already in crisis over the virus outbreak and economic shutdown that has left 41 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits as Congress struggles to respond. State and local leaders pleaded for more federal aid as they stare down red ink due to the rising costs of addressing the COVID-19 crisis and plummeting revenues as Americans stay home. The House approved a new $3 trillion rescue package from Democrats, but the Senate had no immediate plans to consider a fresh round of relief. Instead, Senate Republicans focused on kick-starting the economy and eliminating a $600 unemployment benefit to push Americans back to work when jobs return. They also want to develop a liability shield to protect businesses that do reopen from lawsuits related to COVID-19. A bipartisan group of economists called on Congress Monday to provide $1 trillion in additional aid to states and cities, on par with the House-passed bill. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said roughly 3 million state and local government employees could lose their jobs in the next year — in addition to the nearly 1 million that have already been laid off. “This is about as close to a no-brainer that you could do as possible,” Glenn Hubbard, an economist at Columbia University and a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, said on the conference call organized by the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Deadlines were fast approaching. Most states have budget deadlines with the new fiscal year starting July 1. The $600 boost to unemployment benefits approved in the CARES Act aid package was set to expire July 31. Small businesses that tapped the Paycheck Protection Program will start seeing loans come due without adjustments by Congress. The Senate chaplain, Barry Black, opened the chamber with a prayer over lawmakers. “May they strive to find a vaccine to inoculate our nation against hate, sin and despair,” he said. ——— Associated Press writer Chris Rugaber contributed to this report.",0.0

Trump said he was recommending that governors deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets.” If governors fail to take action, Trump said, he will deploy the United States military and “quickly solve the problem for them.” As Trump spoke in the Rose Garden, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding as police and National Guard soldiers aggressively forced back hundreds of protesters who gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, and chanted peacefully against police brutality and the death of George Floyd. Trump deplored the violence that broke out in the nation’s capital Sunday night and warned that Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew would be strictly enforced. But in Minneapolis, Floyd’s brother, Terrence, made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was pinned to the pavement by an officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said. The crowd chanted, “What’s his name? George Floyd!” and “One down, three to go!” in reference to the four officers involved in Floyd’s arrest. Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. The gathering was part rally and part impromptu eulogy as Floyd urged people to stop the violence and use their power at the ballot box. “If I’m not over here messing up my community, then what are you all doing?” he said. “You all are doing nothing. Because that’s not going to bring my brother back at all.” The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred in part by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. On Monday, police fired tear gas at hundreds of protesters who spilled onto an interstate highway in the heart of Philadelphia just before a 6 p.m. curfew took effect. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” Meanwhile, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. That distinguishes it from the official autopsy, which said he died from the effects of being restrained along with underlying health problems and potential intoxicants in his system. The official autopsy found nothing “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” The second autopsy was done by a doctor who also examined the body of Eric Garner, a New York man who died in an officer’s chokehold six years ago. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man, Matthew Lee Rupert, saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. The video also showed him attempting to light a business on fire, and looting, according to an FBI affidivit. Early Sunday, he posted more videos of himself in and around Chicago, saying “let’s start a riot.” He was arrested in Chicago for violating the city’s curfew. As they girded for more violence, Washington and New York joined other cities in announcing curfews. The move followed a chaotic Sunday night in New York, where groups broke into Chanel, Prada and Rolex boutiques and electronics stores. Hours before Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew was to go into effect, nearly a dozen National Guard vehicles rumbled through the White House grounds and exited opposite Lafayette Park, where crowds had gathered for another night of protests. On Sunday, police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of protesters in the park. They scattered to light fires in nearby streets. At least 4,400 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis. While police in places tried to ease tensions by kneeling or marching in solidarity with the demonstrators, officers around the country were accused of treating protesters with the same kind of heavy-handed tactics that contributed to the unrest in the first place. Cities struggled to keep police in line. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an officer was suspended for pushing a kneeling woman to the ground during a protest. In Atlanta, two officers were fired after bashing in the window of a car and using a stun gun on the occupants. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters, knocking two people to the ground. In New York, the police commissioner said about six incidents were being investigated by the department’s internal affairs bureau, including a weekend confrontation in Brooklyn in which two police vehicles appeared to plow through a group of protesters. In another incident, an officer pointed a gun at protesters, drawing condemnation from the mayor. ——— Associated Press journalists across the U.S. contributed to this report.",0.0

In recent years, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the face of the movement. In 2016, he began kneeling before games, during the playing of the national anthem, to protest police treatment of minorities and social inequality. Since last week's death of George Floyd, an African American man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck, there's been a surge of sports figures speaking out. Some have even joined demonstrations that have swept the nation. True to its status as the most politically progressive of this country's major sports, the NBA has had many players and officials lend their voices – from Commissioner Adam Silver to Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James to legendary Lakers center and longtime political activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who wrote about what he believes is the motivation behind the widespread protests. ""The black community is used to the institutional racism inherent in education, the justice system and jobs,"" Abdul-Jabbar said in a Los Angeles Times essay last weekend. ""And even though we do all the conventional things to raise public and political awareness ... the needle hardly budges."" He added, ""Yes, protests often are used as an excuse for some to take advantage, just as when fans celebrating a hometown sports team championship burn cars and destroy storefronts. I don't want to see stores looted or even buildings burn. But African Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you're choking on it — until you let the sun in."" Even Michael Jordan weighed in publicly, which to many was a surprise. The recent 10-part ESPN documentary, The Last Dance, lionized the legendary Chicago Bulls star, although it touched on a few perceived shortcomings, including what some see as Jordan's unwillingness to speak out on political issues. ""I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in,"" Jordan said in the documentary, adding, ""but I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player. ""I wasn't a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That's where my energy was."" But now Jordan is speaking out, an indication of how deeply Floyd's death has resonated. ""I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry,"" Jordan said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""I see and feel everyone's pain, outrage and frustration. I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough."" There have been other heartfelt, and perhaps surprising, shows of solidarity. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz also has been largely apolitical in his four years in the NFL. But last week, Wentz was one of the first prominent white athletes to speak out. ""Being from North Dakota, I've spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I'm never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through,"" Wentz said on Twitter. ""I'll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color. ... ""I don't understand the society we live in that doesn't value all human life. It's heartbreaking and disturbing. My prayers go out to every man, woman and child that has to endure the effects of the racism in our society."" Former and current African American teammates praised Wentz. ""You didn't have to say a thing but you did,"" former Eagles receiver Torrey Smith tweeted, adding, ""Love you bro."" Traditionally, Major League Baseball has, as a sport, avoided politics. Not now. A number of big leaguers have weighed in, including Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Doolittle. He's white, and he offered historical context in a tweet with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. ""Racism is America's Original Sin,"" Doolittle wrote. ""It was here before we even forged a nation, and has been passed down from generation to generation. And we still struggle to acknowledge that it even exists, much less atone for it. The generational trauma of racism and violence is killing black men and women before our eyes. ... ""We must not look away from the racism and violence. ... We must take action and call it out for what it is. We must recognize our shared humanity and atone for our Original Sin, or else we will continue to curse future generations with it. ""RIP George Floyd."" Still silence Even though the current environment seems to encourage sports figures to speak out, there's also notable silence coming from the sports world. So says LeVelle Moton. Moton is the men's basketball head coach at North Carolina Central University. He said white basketball and football coaches from the most prominent college conferences in the nation — the Power Five — are not speaking up. And he said he believes they should be. In fact, he said, they're obligated to do so. ""The reality is, a lot of these coaches have been able to create generational wealth,"" Moton told ESPN Radio. ""Their grandkids' kids are gonna be able to live a prosperous life because athletes who were the complexion of George Floyd were able to run a football, throw a football, shoot a basketball or whatever have you, so they have benefited greatly from athletes that look like George Floyd and many more. But whenever people the complexion of George Floyd are killed, assassinated, murdered in the street in broad daylight, they're silent."" Not all. Prominent white college basketball coaches have spoken out against Floyd's death, including the University of Kentucky's John Calipari, Roy Williams of the University of North Carolina and Michigan State University head coach Tom Izzo. Nick Saban is the most famous active head coach in Division 1 college football. He also released a statement about Floyd. ""We're at an important moment for our country,"" the University of Alabama coach said in a message that cited civil rights icons Rosa Parks and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., ""and now is the time for us to choose kindness, tolerance, understanding, empathy, and most importantly ... it's time to love each other. Every life is precious, and we must understand we have so many more things that unite us than divide us."" Still, the complexity of Kaepernick Sunday's Houston Chronicle sports section went beyond the myriad athlete and coach statements of grief and resolve. It took a strong stand with a full-page editorial statement. The page had a picture of Floyd at the top and a kneeling Kaepernick at the bottom. In between, a section read, ""Imagine, if we had embraced Colin Kaepernick's peaceful protest and paid attention to the issue he was trying to address."" It wasn't the only connector between Floyd and Kaepernick. A dramatic meme circulating since Floyd's death shows a picture of the Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, next to a picture of Kaepernick kneeling in protest. The visuals have stirred up the not-too-distant memory of Kaepernick's protest, which began in 2016, and was politicized from the beginning. And it's prompting harsh criticism of the NFL, even as the league joins the massive sports outpouring of grief and anger. Last weekend, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement offering condolences to Floyd's family as well as those of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, young African Americans also killed in recent high-profile cases. ""These tragedies inform the NFL's commitment and our ongoing efforts,"" Goodell said, adding, ""There remains an urgent need for action. We recognize the power of our platform in communities and as part of the fabric of American society. We embrace that responsibility and are committed to continuing the important work to address these systemic issues together with our players, clubs and partners."" Critics blasted Goodell for what they called hypocrisy. ""Colin Kaepernick asked the NFL to care about the lives of black people and they banned him from their platform,"" said Michael-Shawn Dugar, an NFL writer for The Athletic. Instead of prompting a discussion about police treatment of minorities and social inequality, Kaepernick's protests prompted a debate about patriotism and the flag, fueled by President Trump, who used an expletive to describe Kaepernick and other players who joined the pregame protests. Even though the NFL ultimately endorsed social justice initiatives, Kaepernick still is considered a pariah — no NFL owner has hired him. And with the league dealing with a significant lack of diversity in important head coaching and general manager positions, Goodell's critics said his reference to the league's ""commitment and our ongoing efforts"" is insincere. On their face, Goodell's words seemed in lockstep with much of the rest of the sports world as it grapples with and grieves over Floyd's death. But for many, the renewed attention on Kaepernick and his experience present just as powerful a message about the powerful NFL, where, in the volatile realm of race and justice, words appear louder than actions.

But several states and the District of Columbia have primaries up and down the ballot: Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail by one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He went into the day 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to get. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote, with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary, with its 186 delegates). Rep. Steve King on the ropes. The controversial Iowa conservative faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who has painted King as ineffective in the House, given that he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. Former state Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face either state Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks or ex-Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling, who moved to Iowa in 2017. Miller-Meeks got the backing of Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, have backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces a challenge from the left. A veteran lawmaker from Maryland's 5th Congressional District and No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, Hoyer faces a progressive primary challenge from 29-year-old Mckayla Wilkes. Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment has remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He has outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET Loading... Spy games in New Mexico. The announced retirement of New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall set off a domino effect. Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Luján declared for Udall's Senate seat, leaving open his seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Enter: Valerie Plame, the ex-CIA agent. She has raised and spent more than any candidate in this race and gained national attention with her glossy campaign ad showing her racing backward in a Chevy Camaro on a dusty road. But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take on Torres Small this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It has been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase has outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... Senate matchups to be set in Iowa and Montana. Democrats are hoping to take back the Senate this fall. They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired Adm. Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach who has spent the second most — $1.4 million — on this primary. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... When Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock changed his mind and decided to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, it suddenly put this race on the map for Democrats in a big way. Three other Democrats are on the ballot Tuesday, but Bullock has been expected to win easily, raising more than 10 times what his next opponent has. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Indiana openings. The retirements of moderate Democrat Pete Visclosky in Indiana's 1st District and Republican Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in Congress, in the 5th District has opened up both of these ideologically divergent seats. More than half a dozen Democrats are competing in the 1st District, which is suburban and exurban Chicago, a place that went for Hillary Clinton with 54% of the vote in 2016. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET Loading... In the 5th District, a handful of Republicans have duked it out, including state Sen. Victoria Spartz, who raised and spent the most and got the backing of the Club for Growth, and Beth Henderson, a local businesswoman with the endorsement of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun. Democrats have rallied around one candidate, Christina Hale. This district has been in GOP hands for a long time, but it could be one to watch this fall. The Cook Political Report lists it as only ""lean Republican."" Trump won it with 53% in 2016. Polls close at 6 p.m. ET : 6/01/20 An earlier version of this story mistakenly said Rita Hart is an Iowa state senator. She is a former Iowa state senator. Copyright 2020 NPR.

People have the absolute right to protest and express their feelings toward the city, state and federal authorities regarding Floyd’s death. Peaceful protest does not mean anarchy, vandalism and looting. Citizens are destroying their own cities and impacting the economy and welfare of all individuals. The chaos needs to stop! Outside groups that are entering large cities around the country with the intent of causing destruction and possible death under the guise of protesting for Floyd would be better served if they directed their anger and passions in other more constructive and impactful ways. Justice needs to be done absolutely, but because it is not as swift as people desire does not mean it will not happen. Calm needs to be the way forward if justice for Floyd is going to happen. David Biacan Wahiawa Packed demonstrations risk exposure to virus Any fair-minded person empathizes with the protesters who saw one of their brothers abused and killed by police for insufficient reason in Minneapolis. But I wonder if the protesters realize that by ignoring social distancing and other safeguards, and gathering in most major cities in the country, including at the Hawaii State Capitol, that they are exposing themselves to a deadly virus, which may be what the racists want. Smoky Guerrero Mililani Call them riots, looting, violence — not protests Why don’t you do CNN and other media outlets a favor and write an editorial about the media being able to call a riot a riot (“Fiery Atlanta rally among widespread U.S. protests of George Floyd death,” Star-Advertiser, Top News, May 29)? You’ll be doing a valuable public service by helping to educate the public that a protest can be had in our nation, but rioting, looting and violence are not “protests,” nor should society, let alone the media, tolerate or encourage such. Just imagine if your building or any other media outlet’s building was being attacked as pictured in the article about CNN headquarters. Yet in the reporting, you tolerated attacks on Target and Wendy’s and lawful citizens’ businesses by calling them protests. Gary Wentz Kailua Is America better or worse than 3 years ago? Is our country and the world better off now than 3-1/2 years ago? I think deep down we all know the answer. Joseph Leonardo Diamond Head Public services often are taken for granted Most of us rely heavily on essential things like clean water, functioning roadways, safe parks, beaches and other public spaces, but we rarely think about what it takes to provide our community with the services many of us have come to expect. The work that goes into making a city habitable is endless, and the workers who do those jobs are often the unsung and under-appreciated heroes of our community. COVID-19 has strained many of us, but we can’t let it break us. It’s easy to take public services for granted, but our lives would be very different without them and the workers who provide them. We need to support our local heroes and urge Congress to pass the Heroes Act for state and local aid so we can continue serving our community and work our way toward a new normal. Pamela Mitsumura Aina Haina State must divulge clear timeline for reopening I saw a news report showing bar owners protesting not being allowed to open their businesses, and describing the economic hardship this is causing. I sympathize with the concerns of businesses struggling to survive. The state has not come up with a clear strategy, rationale and timeline for opening up the economy. Businesses often have been given vague dates as to when they might be allowed to open up, and this has caused confusion for businesses and the public. The survival of businesses depends on clearer timelines. Even if the incidence of new COVID-19 cases drops to zero over a month’s period, the state will face the eventuality of having to reduce restrictions on outside visitors and returning residents. I would like to see a strategic plan, rather than what has seemed to be a meandering process, without clear direction, rationale and timelines. Minoru Taniguchi Salt Lake Hawaii is lucky to have Jones Act to bring goods The people of Hawaii are lucky to have a loyal Jones Act U.S. Merchant Marine supporting the islands during these times of coronavirus. The ships have arrived as scheduled, with no disruptions of service. These Jones Act vessels will continue to deliver the goods to the people of Hawaii regardless of decreased cargo volumes. Would you trust a foreign shipping company with an international crew to continue serving Hawaii when cargo volumes and profits fall? The people of Hawaii do not fully grasp how fragile our supply line is. Costco, Foodland, Safeway, Home Depot — none have warehouses. The ships and shipping containers are their warehouses. The goods go from the container to the showroom floor. If we were to go even one week with no ship arrivals, the shelves would be empty. Jack Lutey Haleiwa Choose better cartoon to promote reconciliation I condemn the editorial cartoon, “Taking a knee in America” (Star-Advertiser, May 31), as being extremely distasteful. Anyone who watches television or reads the news is certainly familiar with the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police officers. It is a sad state of affairs that at this time in our history, so many people quite legitimately have the need to protest such police misbehavior. It is unfortunate that at this time, your editorial staff chose not to provide an illustration promoting reconciliation, understanding and empathy.

The brutal restraint of George Floyd ending in his death a week ago at the hands of Minneapolis police seems to have broken through the floodgates of racial tensions, unleashing torrents of angry protest in urban uprisings across the nation, continuing through Monday. Read more The brutal restraint of George Floyd ending in his death a week ago at the hands of Minneapolis police seems to have broken through the floodgates of racial tensions, unleashing torrents of angry protest in urban uprisings across the nation, continuing through Monday. It is only the latest blow, culminating weeks of racially tinged shootings. A woman in Louisville, Ky., and a male jogger in southern Georgia were killed. And the fact that all this is happening in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic, which also has ravaged minority communities most cruelly with fatal illness and financial ruin, merely makes the wound of this tragedy even more painful. Every city has responded differently, responses running the gamut from the small but fervent expression of solidarity in Honolulu’s sign-waving event, to the mammoth marches in metropolitan centers from Atlanta and Washington, D.C., to Seattle and Los Angeles. Overall, the organized daytime demonstrations unfolded peacefully; but as night fell, the protest gave way to looting, vandalism and violence, fires burning, businesses wrecked. It’s impossible to extricate the violence from the lawful protests in the minds of many Americans. This, too, is part of the tragedy. They are two different facets of social upheaval that should be considered separately. The righteous cause of the demonstrators — the striving for social justice — does not excuse the criminality of the opportunists taking advantage of the chaos. The violence is something law enforcement needs to head off. Various city efforts to do so through curfews ultimately failed, with firepower and force sometimes turned against the marchers rather than the marauders. The nation hopes that it won’t witness that play out repeatedly as the protests persist. But that mayhem must not obscure the real importance of the quest for social justice. The black community, joined by a diverse contingent of supporters, cries out to get the assurance of fair treatment under the law. There surely have been gains in racial equality in the past 50 years, but from the vantage point of 2020, that progress appears pathetically weak. African-American men in particular still get disproportionately harsh treatment. Floyd died with his head pressed to the pavement, the police officer’s knee on his neck for more than eight minutes, past the point when he was unresponsive. All four police officers at the scene as Floyd was suffocated must be prosecuted to the fullest extent. All have been fired, and charges, including murder in the third degree, have been filed against Derek Chauvin, the former officer who aggressively subdued Floyd. The police in Minneapolis and elsewhere must be pressed to reform the way they interact with the communities they serve. Honolulu Police Department has its own challenges, but its police officers generally share the same socioeconomic makeup as that of the public. That is a key asset lacking in many other cities. And at this time in particular, America needs to hear voices of calm and reason — traditionally the role of the president. Sadly, President Trump so far has adopted a wartime footing, on Monday pledging to call on the military to “dominate the streets” at future protests. Hawaii’s governor and top leaders on Monday afternoon rightly rejected this “arming up” playbook, vowing instead to work collaboratively with U.S. military entities here to resist stoking heated, divisive rhetoric. Law and order, while necessary for every community, won’t be achieved without a measure of empathy. These grievances simply won’t heal without addressing poverty, educational disparities and the racial bias that persists in American society. These are people who deserve the certainty that they will receive the promises of “justice for all,” that they are ordinary citizens — not enemies to be subdued.",0.0

The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death due to asphyxiation a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General Bill Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you, you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement, if you don't put it down it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president urged in a Rose Garden address that the governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" In the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" Pritzker, speaking later on CNN, remarked: ""Well, it's illegal. He can't do it. We won't request military assistance here in the state of Illinois. I can't imagine why any governor is going to do that. This is, it's ridiculous,"" he said. Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a ""no knock"" warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them."" ",0.0

In the days following George Floyd's homicide at the hands of Minneapolis police, reporters have been covering the protests in more than 140 cities across the country, trying to make sense of this tumultuous moment. Here are some of the most illuminating stories that we've read this week to help us understand how we got here, and the larger issues driving the protests. Minneapolis in context This is hardly the first time that Minneapolis has erupted into protests about police brutality and the killings of black people. In 2016, people took to the streets after police shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in a nearby suburb, Falcon Heights. And in 2015, Minneapolis police shot and killed Jamar Clark, which ignited two weeks of protests. In The Boston Review, Elizabeth Stinton relates the current protests in Minneapolis to the ones that followed the deaths of Clark and Castile. She also looks at the nationwide unrest that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Similar to the uprisings that took place over half a century ago, she writes, Minneapolis residents are fed up with the ""buildup of unanswered grievances and the lack of concrete changes to their immediate living conditions."" ""Rather than responding to violent political rebellion with policy—such as addressing mass unemployment, failing public schools, and inhumane housing conditions—policymakers and officials, from Richard Nixon's War on Crime to the bipartisan War on Drugs to Donald Trump's embrace of 'Law and Order' politics, have consistently sought to manage the material consequences of socioeconomic problems (e.g., urban decay and drug abuse) with more police, more surveillance, and, eventually, more incarceration. We as a nation still fail to reckon with the wisdom King prophetically offered toward the end of his life: that only 'social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention. There is no other answer. Constructive social change will bring certain tranquility; evasions will merely encourage turmoil.'"" Policing Over at Slate, Joel Anderson writes that while many police chiefs are condemning the excessive use of force by the police officer who killed Floyd, it's important to pay attention to what police are doing during protests: ""The initial response of police leaders may have felt like progress, but video footage of police and protesters clashing in the streets reveals the truth: Officers are much closer to what we see in viral videos documenting their brutality than in the well-intentioned words of their leaders. Despite the shift in public statements, police haven't changed since the protests of 2014 and 2015."" Many protesters, including journalists, have captured police on tape pointing guns, shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at them. Michael Dessam compiled a list at Slate of the ways police incited violence: ""Police all over the country tear-gassed protesters, drove vehicles through crowds, opened fire with nonlethal rounds on journalists or people on their own property, and in at least one instance, pushed over an elderly man who was walking away with a cane."" Existing while black The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging during the protests, and as we've reported, black people are dying from the virus at disproportionate rates. And as Annelisa Merelli at Quartz writes, police brutality is also a public health crisis that affects black people at a much higher rate than others: ""To give a sense of the magnitude of the crisis, the APHA reported that in 2016 alone (the latest year for which the organization could get reliable data, in itself a telling sign of the lack of priority accorded to the issue) at least 1,019 people were killed due to police intervention, and 76,440 were injured. This resulted in nearly 55,000 years of life lost, and had a large price tag, too: Police brutality costs $1.8 billion per year, according to the Centers for Disease Control's most recently available data (2010)."" Many argue that these two crises for the black community—police brutality and the coronavirus—aren't independent of each other. In fact, in both cases the extent of the death toll stems from systematic discrimination, and in both cases, the solution may require a deep rethinking of the overall system. In The Atlantic, Ibram X. Kendi examines a 1896 document by a statistician that says black people were naturally selected for disease and death, and would gradually become extinct. Kendi goes on to write that ""too many Americans have been waiting for black extinction since Hoffman,"" and that black Americans are ""living in a nightmare"" rather than the elusive American Dream: ""A nightmare is essentially a horror story of danger, but it is not wholly a horror story. Black people experience joy, love, peace, safety. But as in any horror story, those unforgettable moments of toil, terror, and trauma have made danger essential to the black experience in racist America. What one black American experiences, many black Americans experience. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the toil and terror and trauma of other black Americans. Black Americans are constantly stepping into the souls of the dead. Because they know: They could have been them; they are them. Because they know it is dangerous to be black in America, because racist Americans see blacks as dangerous."" Stories of solidarity Our NPR colleague Leila Fadel wrote about a Somali immigrant, Safia Munye, who opened a restaurant in Minneapolis more than two years ago—only to close her doors due to COVID-19. However, the community rallied behind her business and raised more than $180,000 to re-open this weekend—that is, until it was burned down during the protests. But despite her loss, Munye says she wants justice for George Floyd and change for Minneapolis. ""'My heart is broken. My mind is broken,' she says. 'I know I can't come back from this. But this can be replaced. George's life cannot. George's life was more important. That man that got killed in the most inhumane way. I hope he gets justice.'"" And The New York Times brought us another story about resilience and solidarity, about a Bangaldeshi family in Minneapolis who also lost their restaurant after it was burned down during one of the protests. Yet they support the uprising, and even opened the restaurant's doors as a medical haven for protesters. "" 'We were just trying to do what we could to help our community,' said [Hafsa] Islam, who helped treat wounded protesters. 'Sure, we had our business. Sure, we were trying to keep our kitchen open. But more than anything, we were concerned for our people.' ""The tension in [Ruhel] Islam's adopted city reminds him of his childhood in Bangladesh, when he lived through a dictatorship. Two of his fellow students were killed by the police, he said. 'We grew up in a traumatic police state, so I am familiar with this type of situation,' he said.""

Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful. But looting and vandalism in some areas along Van Nuys Boulevard prompted a response from officers, who fired bean bags. Authorities also responded to a fire at a strip mall, according to the Los Angeles Times. San Francisco Bay Area Some 15,000 people marched peacefully in downtown Oakland, according to a police spokesperson quoted in the East Bay Times. Most dispersed prior to the start of the city's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. More than 40 people were arrested for violating the curfew, according to the Oakland Police Department. The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said. Police said some protesters had vandalized a handful of vehicles, according to NPR member station KQED. More than a dozen San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions have imposed curfews in the wake of protests sparked by Floyd's death. Corrections: 6/02/20 A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that 15,000 people marched on Interstate 680 in Walnut Creek, Calif., and were dispersed by police. The correct figure is several hundred. The march by 15,000 people was peaceful and took place in Oakland, Calif.",0.0
1623234113,2020-06-02 06:05:00,"Amid protests, Trump talks of war — and reelection",https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2020/06/02/nation-world-news/amid-protests-trump-talks-of-war-and-reelection/,en,False,"politics and government, united states politics and government, elections, blacks, demonstrations and riots",225040,westhawaiitoday.com,http://westhawaiitoday.com/,"WASHINGTON — Embracing the language of confrontation and war, President Donald Trump declared himself the “president of law and order” and signaled he would stake his reelection on convincing voters his forceful approach, including deploying U.S. troops to U.S. cities, was warranted in a time of national tumult and racial unrest. Trump made his Rose Garden declaration on Monday evening to the sound of tear gas and rubber bullets clearing peaceful protesters from the park in front of the White House. It created a split screen for the ages, with his critics saying the president was deepening divisions at a time when leadership was crucial to help unify a fractured country. ADVERTISING The president’s forceful turn to a partisan posture was reminiscent of the us-vs.-them rhetoric he has often used when under pressure, including in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. He has responded to the violence with a string of polarizing tweets, one starkly laying out the political stakes by underscoring the approach of Election Day. “NOVEMBER 3RD,” was all it said. Trump vowed to deploy the U.S. military to America’s own cities to quell a rise of violent protests, including ransacking stores and burning police cars. He offered little recognition of the anger coursing through the country as he demanded a harsher crackdown on the mayhem that has erupted following the death of George Floyd. Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed his neck with his knee as the man pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Violent demonstrations have raged in dozens of cities across the nation, marking a level of widespread turmoil unseen for decades. The political ground beneath Trump has greatly shifted in the spring of this election year. He was supposed to be running on a strong economy, but now he’s facing a pandemic, an economic collapse and civil unrest not seen since the 1960s. Indeed, some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots and captured the White House. But Trump is the incumbent and, despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, he risks being held responsible for the violence. Trump emerged after two days out of public view in the White House to threaten to deploy “thousands and thousands” of U.S. troops. Then he made a surprise walk through Lafayette Park to a Washington house of worship known as “The Church of the Presidents” that suffered fire damage in the protests. That brought a quick condemnation from Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. But he had his campaign moment. In a video teleconference Monday morning, Trump scolded governors. “Most of you are weak,” he said. “It’s like a war. And we will end it fast. Be tough.” “You have to dominate” and “if you don’t dominate you’re wasting your time,” Trump said, demanding the protests be swiftly crushed, even as some warned that such an aggressive law enforcement response could lead to an escalation of violence. The president urged governors to make more use of the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced spasms of violence, including New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. “You’re going to arrest all those people and you’re going to try them. And if they get five years or 10 years, they have to get five years or 10 years,” the president said. “So I say that, and the winners dominate.” Trump’s exhortations came after a night of escalating violence, with images of chaos overshadowing largely peaceful protests. The disturbances grew so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground White House bunker previously used during terrorist attacks. Some West Wing officials and political advisers have acknowledged that some of the president’s tweets have not been helpful, and they have been pushing Trump to acknowledge the pain of the peaceful protesters without lumping them in with the agitators he says are responsible for the violence. But another faction within the administration, including longtime law-and-order proponent Attorney General William Barr, has encouraged Trump’s instincts to focus on the group violence. The hope is such a posture can help Trump draw a contrast with Democrats who have been less vocal in their condemnation of the unrest. The West Wing had been mostly empty over the weekend. Many staffers were told to stay home to avoid the protests, chief of staff Mark Meadows was out of town celebrating his daughter’s wedding and senior adviser Jared Kushner was marking a Jewish holiday. Among the options being discussed in the White House: a new criminal justice reform package, a task force that would include Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and a listening tour of African American communities, according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because nothing had been finalized. Democrats hammered Trump, accusing him of stirring the unrest. “Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” said the party’s presumptive presidential nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, speaking at a church in Wilmington, Delaware. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump “struggles to summon even an ounce of humanity in this time of turmoil.” “The president has reacted to the pain and anger in the country by playing politics and encouraging police to be tougher on protesters by bragging about his reelection prospects and his personal safety inside the White House,” Schumer said. Long drawn to displays of strength, Trump and his advisers believe that the combative rhetoric and promises to send the military into cities will reassure voters, including senior citizens and suburban women, concerned by the lawlessness. Eager to change the narrative of the election, just five months away, from a referendum on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump and his aides see a cultural war issue that could captivate his base. Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith &Freedom Coalition and a close ally of the president, said, “In the same way that he became the unlikeliest of champions for evangelicals and the faith community, he has it in him to do the same thing for the minority community.” ADVERTISING Much as he has with the pandemic, Trump has tried to scapegoat the nation’s Democratic governors and mayors, much to their dismay. During the teleconference, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker bluntly told Trump that “the rhetoric that’s coming out of the White House is making it worse.”",0.0

Such was the scenario when George Floyd died in Minneapolis last week. ADVERTISING And when Sefolosha watched that video, his memories came flooding back. “I was just horrified by what I saw,” Sefolosha said. “That could have been me.” Time has not healed all wounds for Sefolosha, the NBA veteran who said he was attacked by a group of New York Police Department officers in April 2015 while they were arresting him outside a nightclub in the city’s Chelsea neighborhood. The leg that was broken in the fracas is fine now. The emotional pain returned last week when he saw video of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air in the final moments of his life as a white police officer — subsequently charged with murder — pressed a knee on his neck. Sefolosha has not watched much news since. His experience with police in New York has left him with a deep distrust of law enforcement, the pangs of angst flooding back even when he walks into NBA arenas and sees uniformed officers. And the latest example of police brutality left him even more upset. “People talk about a few rotten apples,” Sefolosha said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But you know, in my experience and from what we’re seeing, I think it’s deeper than that as a culture that’s deeply rooted in it, to be honest. That’s just my honest opinion. I think it’s really … part of a culture where it’s deeper than just a few bad apples.” The four officers who were involved in the incident where Floyd died were fired; the one who knelt on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Massive protests have broken out in several cities in recent days. Sefolosha — a black man and Swiss citizen who plays for the Houston Rockets — considered but decided against joining protests in Atlanta, where he is waiting for the resumption of the NBA season that was shut down in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. “I’m mad, for sure,” Sefolosha said. “That’s for sure. I mean, it’s 2020. Nobody should have to go through this in this time, especially after black people have given up so much for America. Black people have given up so much and done so much for this country. It’s hurtful to see it this way.” Sefolosha’s perspective changed forever on April 8, 2015. Chris Copeland, an NBA player at the time, was among three people stabbed outside the club where Sefolosha was that night; police arrived and ordered everyone to leave the area. Sefolosha says he complied but began getting harassed by officers anyway. Before long, he was on the ground. Sefolosha’s leg was broken and some ligaments were torn in the fracas, and he was arrested on several charges that a jury needed about 45 minutes to determine were unfounded. He wound up suing for $50 million, alleging his civil rights were violated, settled for $4 million and gave much of that money to a public defenders’ organization working in marginalized communities. “It changed me a lot, toward the way I see law enforcement in this country,” Sefolosha said. “And also toward the way I see the whole justice system. I went to court and I had to do all of this to prove my innocence. It really got me deep into the system and I’m really skeptical of the whole system.” NBA players have used their platforms often in recent years to protest racial inequality. Sterling Brown of the Milwaukee Bucks filed a federal civil rights lawsuit after police used a stun gun on him and arrested him over a parking incident in 2018. On Saturday, Malcolm Brogdon of the Indiana Pacers and Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics were among those taking part in Atlanta protests. “You see what happened in Minnesota where three human beings with a badge are watching another human being killing somebody,” said Sefolosha, who has played in the NBA since 2006 and intends to return to Switzerland when he retires. “And instead of saying, ‘OK, this is my duty as a human being,’ the duty was more toward not interfering with the other officer and saying, ‘We are a clan, we stick together no matter what.’ It should be the other way around.” The NBA is closing in on finalizing a plan to resume the season in July at the Disney complex near Orlando, Florida. Sefolosha and the Rockets figure to be contenders for a championship when play resumes. ADVERTISING For obvious reasons, Sefolosha’s mind isn’t there yet. “I’ll be happy to be with my teammates and reunited with basketball in general,” Sefolosha said. “But you know, we’re human beings, and the fight has been going on for too long and the same protests have been going on for too long. I think it’s definitely time for change and that should be a priority for all of us.”",0.0

PC: Max Dible Protestors lined the Queen Ka‘ahumanu Highway bottleneck in the heart of Kailua-Kona Sunday afternoon, standing in solidarity with those across the country demonstrating against police violence and the killing of black and brown individuals while in police custody. Following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week, more than 200 protestors created rows of slow-moving traffic on the stretch of road just south of the Henry Street intersection, accompanied by a symphony of supportive car horns and scores of signs decrying racism, injustice and police violence. “We’re in a really unique position here where we’re a minority-majority state, so we don’t experience it the same way as a lot of the rest of America does, but I think it’s important to show up and show our support no matter what,” said Ashley Lake, of Kailua-Kona. Protestors were technically in violation of COVID-19 measures, based on social distancing requirements set forth by an emergency proclamation from Gov. David Ige and adopted as part of the current Hawai‘i County policy. However, police made no arrests, wrote no citations, and gave no orders to disperse. SPONSORED VIDEO Nearly everyone lining the highway wore a face mask out of respect for current rules, and the Kailua-Kona protest was entirely peaceful — neither of which can be said for many demonstrations in mainland cities where violence and chaos have led to arson, looting, and police measures of crowd control that have included deploying tear gas and the firing of rubber bullets into groups of civilians. Reporters have also suffered through arrests and physical altercations with police in multiple instances. State and federal authorities have voiced suspicions that most of the destruction and violence characterizing protests in cities like Minneapolis, Atlanta and New York can be attributed to a small group of people who have “infiltrated” the ranks of protestors with the intent to escalate tensions — namely members of white supremacist groups and far left-wing radical political organizations. President Donald Trump painted state governors with a broad brush in a conference call Monday, calling them “weak” and telling them to “dominate” interactions with protestors, whom he referred to as “terrorists,” lest the state leaders look like “jerks” in the eyes of the public. West Hawai‘i demonstrations were subject to no such drama Sunday, as protestors spoke loudly, but respectfully, for three gray afternoon hours. Police did arrive on the scene after reports that protestors were blocking bike lanes. Reports from those in attendance varied on how many police vehicles arrived to the demonstration, with some estimating as few as six or seven and others saying it was as many as 12. “The tone definitely shifted,” Lake said of the mood upon the arrival of police. “I don’t think anybody expected the cops to show up here. The tone always shifts when people in authority show up.” Interactions between authorities and police were amicable, however, according to eye witness reports. All police vehicles had departed before, or as of, 3 p.m. Sunday. “This is just how it is in Hawai‘i,” said Yvette Kay, an organizer with the Hawai‘i chapter of the activist group Matriarchy Rising. “We don’t do violent protests here. That’s just a difference in culture.” Still, protestors in Kona said some of the outward expressions of anger seen on the mainland are understandable considering hundreds of years of racial oppression and discrimination, as well as a decades-long history of minorities dying in police custody. Derek Chauvin, one of four arresting officers, has been charged with 3rd Degree Murder and 2nd Degree Manslaughter in the death of 46-year-old George Floyd on May 25, 2020. “I think it’s not surprising, given what’s happened,” Kona protestor Lianne Yu said of the volatile developments involving mainland protests. “I also think people are frustrated with nothing changing, and they’re frustrated by the message coming from the very top — the President not addressing what’s happening and blaming all others. We need leadership that will understand and fix the problem and get to the bottom of systemic racism in our country.” Kay added that the context of COVID-19 has injected the situation with an infusion of frustration and helplessness surrounding more than 100,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the United States already, as well as a booming unemployment rate and stay-at-home orders that limited most aspects of life in parts of the country for months. She, too, criticized federal leadership decisions, namely to focus on the looting and violence that’s occurred over the last week of protests instead of what protestors believe to be the heart of the problem — the racial injustice that fueled, and ultimately lit, the social powder keg now exploding nationwide and reverberating across three continents. Big Island Now spoke to roughly a dozen protestors Sunday, but it remained unclear who specifically was responsible for organizing one of the largest protest turnouts in Kailua-Kona in years. Everyone questioned said they were made aware of the demonstration via social media, typically on Instagram or Facebook, after news of the pending protest began making the rounds online during the middle of last week. “I’m impressed with our little town for showing up as we have today,” Lake said. “I really think it’s a show of support and saying ‘not here,’ either.”",0.0

Health experts need newly infected people to remember and recount everyone they’ve interacted with over several days in order to alert others who may have been exposed, and prevent them from spreading the disease further. But that process, known as contact tracing, relies on people knowing who they’ve been in contact with — a daunting task if they’ve been to a mass gathering. ADVERTISING And the process relies on something that may suddenly be in especially short supply: Trust in government. “These events that are happening now are further threats to the trust we need,” said Dr. Sandro Galea, dean of the Boston University School of Public Health. “If we do not have that, I worry our capacity to control new outbreaks becomes more limited,” he said. Government officials have been hoping to continue reopening businesses, churches and other organizations after months of stay-at-home orders and other infection-prevention measures. But health experts also hoped that any reopening would be accompanied by widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation to prevent new waves of illness from beginning. Over the past week, protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned a knee to his neck, have involved thousands of people gathered tightly together in large crowds in more than 20 cities nationwide. It’s unclear if the protests themselves will trigger large new outbreaks. The protests were outside, where infections don’t spread as readily as indoors. Also, many of the protesters were wearing masks, and much of the contact was likely less-hazardous “transient” moments of people moving around, passing each other, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. But, still, experts worry that public efforts to contain the disease in the future could be undermined. In Los Angeles, the city’s mayor announced Saturday that COVID-19 testing centers were being closed because of safety concerns related to violent protests. Testing in Minneapolis will be affected because some of the clinics that provide the service have been damaged in the protests, according to a city government spokesperson. Reduced testing could “be giving the virus another head start,” Schaffner said. And contact tracing, which is only just getting going in several states, is an even bigger concern. It involves people who work for or with health departments asking intimate questions about where a person has been and who they’ve been talking to — and getting full, truthful answers in return. “In this current environment which has enhanced or brought forth a mistrust of governmental authority, it might make them disinclined to speak with anyone in government,” Schaffner said. That is especially true in black communities trying to cope with episodes of police violence and longstanding frustrations with how they have been marginalized and mistreated by people who work for government agencies. And those are the communities that have been hardest hit by the coronavirus in the U.S. and most in need of public health measures to help control it. Protests in Salt Lake City that drew several thousand people are a setback for contact tracers already struggling to contain the spread of the coronavirus, said Tair Kiphibane, infectious disease bureau manager for the Salt Lake County Health Department. She became concerned as she watched hundreds of protesters go by her downtown Salt Lake City office Saturday afternoon where she and her staff were working another weekend day after seeing increases in COVID-19 cases last week. She sent contact tracers home three hours early Saturday as protests grew violent near the office. She expects further increases in cases because so many people were close to one another during the protest. Tracing the web of infected people that may have been exposed will be daunting since protesters likely won’t have names and phone numbers for many of the people they were around. “It is going to make it so much harder,” Kiphibane said. “It could be anybody. They don’t know most of those people … It is just too many people.” In a press conference Saturday, Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington used the term “contact tracing” when describing an investigation into arrested protesters there. He said the goal is to “see if there are crime or white supremacy organizations that have played a role” and “to understand how do we go after them, legally,” Harrington said. But Harrington’s use of “contact tracing” by law enforcement may complicate the job of health workers as they try to track the virus’s spread, some experts said. “That was an abuse of the word ‘contact tracing.’ That is not what contact tracing is,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ADVERTISING “Contact tracing is a service to patients and their contacts to provide services for patients and warning for contacts. It has nothing to do with police activity. Nothing,” said Frieden, who is now president of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit that works to prevent epidemics. Galea said he hopes many people will separate in their minds the contact tracing done by public health workers from crime investigations by the police. But, he added, “I do think sometimes it’s difficult to make a distinction when you feel marginalized by, and targeted by, the entire government.”",0.0

ADVERTISING So too have Washington’s adversaries in Iran and elsewhere. Long the target of American criticism, these nations have used the protests over the killing of George Floyd as an opportunity to hit back at the country held up by U.S. leaders for decades as “the shining city upon a hill.” By putting forth images of the unrest, they portray the U.S. as a hypocritical superpower unable to secure its own people, as well as normalizing the violence and repression they visit on their own citizens. “To be clear, though they are trying to sympathize with protesters in the U.S., their aim is to leverage the internal divisions in America, … not to advance the debate on this,” said Ariane Tabatabai, a Middle East fellow who studies Iran at the Washington-based German Marshall Fund. “Regime officials particularly like the theme of racial tensions in the U.S. because it allows them to point the finger at Washington, which is often front and center condemning human rights abuses by the regime,” she said. That’s particularly valuable to Iran, which has violently put down recent nationwide economic demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access. The Islamic Republic has seen its already-ailing economy crater since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers, cutting off its oil sales. “The American regime is pursuing violence and bullying at home and abroad,” Mousavi said. That criticism has extended to Twitter, which Iranian officials use extensively despite the website being banned since the mass protests and crackdown surrounding its disputed 2009 presidential election. Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose disputed re-election sparked the 2009 unrest, called Floyd’s killing “disturbing & upsetting.” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif offered a rewritten statement earlier issued by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, crossing out Iran and replacing it with America. Pompeo responded by tweeting: “You hang homosexuals, stone women and exterminate Jews.” State-controlled media in China saw the protests through the prism of American views on Hong Kong’s anti-government demonstrations, which China has long said the U.S. encouraged. In a commentary, the ruling Communist Party newspaper Global Times said Chinese experts had noted that U.S. politicians might think twice before commenting again on Hong Kong, knowing “their words might backfire.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian offered his own criticism at a Beijing news conference. The protests “once again reflect the racial discrimination in the U.S., the serious problems of police violent enforcement and the urgency of solving these problems,” Zhao said. He added that China hopes the U.S. will “safeguard and guarantee the legal rights of ethnic minorities.” That’s as China continues a yearslong, massive crackdown that has locked away more than 1 million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslims. In North Korea, the country’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported about the demonstrations, saying that protesters “harshly condemned” a white policeman’s “lawless and brutal murder” of a black citizen. Three large photos showed protests from recent days from Minneapolis, where Floyd died May 25 after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. The officer was fired and charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted. Rodong Sinmun noted hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting, “No justice, no peace.” It did not make any direct comments about Trump, whom North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has met three times in high-profile summits. Russia said the United States had systemic human rights problems, criticism that followed a pattern dating to the Cold War. The 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School by nine African American students supported by bayonet-carrying soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division saw one Soviet newspaper use the headline: “Troops Advance Against Children!” That information warfare continues today in the cyber-realm, as U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia meddled America’s 2016 presidential election. Tabatabai said she and her colleagues had been tracking Chinese, Iranian and Russian social media accounts using the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd. U.S. allies as well have been expressing their own opinions on the unrest. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the arrests and assaults on journalists were “very concerning.” Zimbabwe summoned the U.S. ambassador over U.S. national security adviser Robert O’Brien’s allegation this weekend that Harare could be one of several foreign adversaries taking advantage of the demonstrations. Meanwhile, Germany’s center-left Social Democratic Party, which is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition, on Monday described itself as “157 (years old) and Antifa. Naturally.” The tweet appeared to be a response to Trump’s assertion that he would designate Antifa, an umbrella description for the far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events, “a terrorist organization.” Across from the U.S. Embassy in Paris, dozens of people knelt in silent protest, urging the French government to take racism and police violence more seriously. Despite a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people because of the coronavirus, they held signs reading “I Can’t Breathe” in English, or “Racism is suffocating us” and “We are all George Floyd” in French. Thousands of people packed Dam Square in central Amsterdam and spilled into several side streets in an unexpectedly large protest to denounce police brutality in the U.S. and Europe. They chanted “Black lives matter!” raising their fists and holding anti-racism signs. In Perth, Australia, the hundreds of demonstrators who peacefully protested Floyd’s death also sought to highlight injustices against indigenous Australians. “I believe it’s important as a young indigenous woman to vocalise that this isn’t just an American issue, this is a black people issue and indigenous people fit into that category,” organizer Tanesha Bennell told Nine Network television. Protesters carried banners with messages including “No Pride in Genocide” and tears appeared as the names of indigenous people who have died in Australian police custody were read to the crowd.

Some showed up only hours after taking part in demonstrations over the death of George Floyd, a black man pinned to the ground by a white Minneapolis police officer who pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes. Many said cleaning felt cathartic during a dark period for a nation battling the coronavirus pandemic, the job losses that followed and now the worst racial unrest in half a century. ADVERTISING Bill Stuehler donned a mask Sunday and marched with a fellow nurse and other activists in Los Angeles, later trying to stop young people from breaking into stores and stealing. At home, he kept watching the violence on live feeds and fell deeper into despair. So before sunrise, the 66-year-old grabbed brooms, a rake and a trash shovel and drove to nearby Long Beach to clean up the mess. Soon, more than 2,000 people were working side by side, scrubbing, filling trash containers and repairing what they could in the hard-hit city south of Los Angeles. “It was pretty amazing to see the number of people turn out for the community,” Stuehler said. “It restored the faith in humanity that I had lost last night.” Throngs of people nationwide volunteered to help businesses — from small shops to major chains — bounce back from the damage, though some stores had burned to the ground and another night of unrest was expected. In New Jersey, Chris DeLeon, broom in hand, arrived at 8 a.m. with dozens of other people to sweep up broken glass in the capital of Trenton. The 34-year-old had protested Sunday, then decided to help clean up after seeing videos of people smashing windows. “It just goes to show there’s at least as many good people as there are other folks out there,” DeLeon said. In Wisconsin, volunteers in Milwaukee and Madison turned up for a second day to clean up damage from the night before. Countless businesses already had taken a hit from restrictions designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus and were starting to reopen just as the protests led to more expensive setbacks: vandalism and stolen merchandise. The owner of the Laugh Factory’s club in Long Beach discovered broken windows and doors, computers smashed and memorabilia stolen, including Three Stooges posters and autographed photos of Redd Foxx and other late comedians. Workers boarded up windows and swept up broken glass Monday. Owner Jamie Masada was offering an unspecified reward to anyone who returns the memorabilia. “It is not worth anything to them but it means a lot to me,” Masada said, because it’s tied to those who represent “the height of comedy.’” In Sacramento, two-thirds of the capital city’s 600 downtown properties took a hit, with more than 200 broken windows, 330 pieces of graffiti, and more than 50 cases of “significant property damage,” said Michael Ault, executive director of the Downtown Sacramento Partnership. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said she didn’t recognize downtown when she walked through it Sunday, “but what I did recognize were the hundreds of volunteers and residents who came because they love Seattle.” Stuehler found the same community spirit in Long Beach. A nurse who had been treating COVID-19 patients, Stuehler took the month off when he joined the protest. He said a small percentage of people vandalized businesses but “the horror of the opportunism, the rage, the disregard for logic and reason — it was shocking.” They had an outsize impact that detracts from the message of overhauling police agencies, Stuehler said. But he said he’s feeling revived after seeing so many people work together. Alycia Barber also was moved to help after watching from her Long Beach apartment as people smashed windows and police doused the crowds with pepper spray Sunday. The 22-year-old got up early and joined others organizing clothing and jewelry strewn inside a Forever 21 store, hours after thieves made off with armloads of merchandise. Few of the volunteers knew each other; they just showed up, she said. ADVERTISING There were parents with children, senior citizens, college students. One woman brought paint and brooms so people could paint over graffiti on the outside wall of a parking garage. “I just feel so helpful today,” Barber said, adding that she supports the fight against racial injustice. “But now we also want to get up and make the world a beautiful place for people.”",0.0

His announcement came as police under federal command forced back peaceful demonstrators with tear gas so he could walk to a nearby church and pose with a Bible. Trump’s bellicose rhetoric came as the nation convulsed through another round of violence over the death of George Floyd at a time when the country is already buckling under the coronavirus outbreak and the Depression-level unemployment it has caused. The president demanded an end to the heated protests in remarks from the White House Rose Garden and vowed to use more force to achieve that aim. ADVERTISING If governors throughout the country do not deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” Trump said the U.S. military would step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Yet the message Trump appeared to be sending with the brazen pushback of protesters outside the White House was that he sees few limits to what he is willing to do. Some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of a summer of riots, capturing the White House. But despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider, Trump is an incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence. Minutes before Trump began speaking, police and National Guard soldiers began aggressively forcing back hundreds of peaceful protesters who had gathered in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, where they were chanting against police brutality and Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. Floyd died last week after he was pinned to the pavement by a police officer who put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing. His death set off protests that spread from Minneapolis across America. His brother Terrence pleaded with protesters on Monday to remain peaceful. Five months before Election Day, the president made clear that he would stake his reelection efforts on convincing voters that his strong-arm approach was warranted to quell the most intense civil unrest since the 1960s. He made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. The scene in and around the White House on Monday night appeared to be carefully orchestrated. As the crowd of protesters grew, Attorney General William Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to look over at the demonstrations and the swarm of law enforcement. The sudden shift in tactics against the protesters was initially a mystery. Then, after finishing his Rose Garden remarks, Trump emerged from the White House gates and walked through the park to St. John’s Church, where an office had been set on fire the previous night. Trump, who rarely attends church, held up a Bible and gathered a group of advisers — all white — to pose for photos. The moment was quickly decried by Trump’s critics, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying the president “used the military to push out a peaceful protest so he could have a photo op at a church.” “It’s all just a reality TV show for this president,” he said on Twitter. “Shameful.” Federal law permits presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But Trump’s statements also set up an immediate conflict with officials in New York and other states who asserted that the president does not have the unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred largely by Floyd’s death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding that three of his colleagues be prosecuted, too. All four were fired. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, others have descended into violence, leaving neighborhoods in shambles, stores ransacked, windows broken and cars burned, despite curfews around the country and the deployment of thousands of National Guard members in at least 15 states. On Monday, demonstrations erupted from Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, to Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators, to Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard soldiers put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s state Capitol to honor Floyd. Two people were killed during protests in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, authorities said, but provided no details. In Louisville, Kentucky, riot police firing tear gas scattered several hundred protesters from downtown, violently capping a day of mostly peaceful protests. A vehicle plowed through a group of law enforcement officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two. Video from the scene showed the vehicle accelerating through an intersection shortly after officers apparently tackled a protester and handcuffed him. The officers were hospitalized in stable condition, authorities said. In New York City, where nightfall has brought widespread scenes of destruction, large crowds rallied peacefully in Times Square and Brooklyn during the day. Then, in early evening, looters rushed into a Nike store in Manhattan and protesters smashed storefront windows near Rockefeller Center. Video posted on social media showed some protesters arguing with people breaking windows, urging them to stop. The city has already endured immense commercial damage from the unrest. On Monday, rioters got through the doors of the city’s flagship Macy’s store, famous for its Thanksgiving Day parade, and police later pulled at least two handcuffed men out of the store and put them into a van. By that time, most of the the street was littered with broken glass. In Washington, protesters continued marching peacefully through Washington hours after being forced from Lafayette park and past the 7 p.m. curfew. Eventually, within sight of the Capitol building, the marchers were turned back by law enforcement officers using tear gas, pellets and low-flying helicopters kicking up debris. As they dispersed, some protesters smashed windows at a nearby office building. Earlier Monday, Trump told the nation’s governors in a video conference that they “look like fools” for not deploying even more National Guard troops. “Most of you are weak,” he said. He added: “You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, dismissed Trump’s comments as the “rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office. He met in person with black leaders in Delaware and also held a virtual meeting with big-city mayors. Biden said hate emerges “when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate.” In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd’s brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested. “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please,” Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to use their power at the ballot box. Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said. Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up. ADVERTISING But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by the Associated Press.",0.0

""He used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington tells NPR's Morning Edition. ""He held up his Bible after speaking [an] inflammatory militarized approach to the wounds of our nation."" ""He did not pray,"" the bishop continued. ""He did not offer a word of balm or condolence to those who are grieving. He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate ... represent."" Every president since James Madison has visited St. John's Church, which opened in 1816 and sits across the park from the White House. Despite that longstanding relationship, Budde says her diocese had no warning of Monday's visit. ""There was no reaching out, no sense that it would require some sort of authorization before using the church as a backdrop in that way,"" Budde told NPR's Tom Gjelten hours after the incident. The president had used the Bible, and her church, as a prop, she said. ""I was outraged that he felt that he had the license to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,"" the bishop told Gjelten. Within hours, the White House had assembled footage of the brief outing into a triumphant video that shows the president pumping his fist as he strides past a row of riot police, culminating in him standing in front of the church. Set to swelling orchestral music, the video shows nearly no sign of the destruction and debris that days of intense protests have wrought near the White House. The president, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, several Cabinet members and Secret Service agents, walked to St. John's a few minutes after Washington's just-installed 7 p.m. curfew began. The federal force used against the demonstrators nearly 30 minutes before the curfew began incensed Mayor Muriel Bowser. ""Shameful!"" Bowser said via Twitter, saying that after ""federal police used munitions on peaceful protestors in front of the White House,"" the city's police force's job of keeping the peace would be made more difficult.

""Despite that as I ran away, clearly stating that we were media, with my cameraman with a camera on his shoulders, I was hit across the back with the baton,"" she says. ""We were then fired upon by the National Guard with those rubber bullets, who are the exact people I had shown my media pass to ... and then we ended up getting tear-gassed."" The situation, she said, was ""absolutely terrifying."" ""I also managed to get a rubber bullet to the backside, and Tim got one in the back of the neck, so we'll have a few bruises tomorrow — but we're feeling perfectly safe,"" Brace says. Shock and anger over the incident led U.S. Ambassador to Australia Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr. to issue a statement saying, ""Freedom of the press is a right Australians and Americans hold dear. We take mistreatment of journalists seriously, as do all who take democracy seriously."" Trump's use of force to allow him to walk across the park has also prompted Arlington County, Va., to pull its police officers out of the nation's capital. The county had sent a police contingent to help keep peace in Washington. But it says the officers were put in a dangerous position that exposed them and others to risk ""for a purpose not worthy of our mutual aid obligations."" ""All ACPD officers left the District of Columbia at 8:30 p.m. Monday,"" Arlington County says. The church has suffered damage during the unrest in Washington against police violence, including a fire that was lit in its basement. While Budde is thankful to first responders who put out that fire, she says she wants the focus to remain on the death of George Floyd and others who have died at the hands of police.

""More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that's what the presidency is: the duty to care — to care for all of us."" On Monday evening, Trump walked from the White House across Lafayette Square to hold a Bible in front of St. John's Church, after peaceful protesters were forcibly cleared from the park. (The U.S. Park Police say they used smoke canisters, not tear gas, though it's not clear if another law enforcement agency engaged there used other munitions.) The forceful dispersal began before the Washington, D.C., curfew had begun, and the bishop overseeing the church has harshly criticized Trump for appearing for photos without praying or addressing the racial issues at the heart of nationwide protests. Trump made the trip after making a speech in which he threatened to deploy the military to states and cities that do not quell violence. ""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while instead of brandishing it,"" Biden said. ""If he opened it, he could have learned something: that we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump isn't interested in doing that work."" Biden echoed the words spoken by George Floyd, the black man whose death while in custody of Minneapolis police has led to the widespread unrest. The words ""I can't breathe,"" Biden said, ""are a wake-up call for our nation."" Biden addressed police abuses and economic disparities that affect what he called ""communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time"" — alluding to the since-charged police officer who had his knee on Floyd's neck before he died. ""The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic racism,"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said. He asked Congress to take up measures he called ""a down payment on what is long overdue,"" including police reform bills outlawing chokeholds, banning the transfer of military weapons to police forces and establishing a uniform use of force standard. He said he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president. Biden also called for expanding the Affordable Care Act to millions more Americans, saying that Trump, who has long opposed the law, is ""consumed with his blinding ego when it comes to [former President] Barack Obama."" Obama's former vice president reiterated what he has long said on the 2020 campaign trail, that there is a ""battle for the soul of America."" ""Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears,"" Biden said. ""He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well-being that he leads. ""The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won't either,"" Biden said. ""But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate."" In a statement following his remarks, Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign adviser, said Biden has ""obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy."" She added: ""Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has used the politics of racial division when they suited his needs and he is doing it again."" On Monday, Biden held his first in-person campaign event since the coronavirus took hold in the United States in mid-March. He met with African American faith leaders in Wilmington, Del., listening to at-times critical feedback from the group. Many of the invited guests chided Biden for a political system that has delivered ""hopelessness"" to young African Americans. They told him the Obama administration had not done enough to economically lift black Americans, something Biden then promised would be a centerpiece of any recovery plan from the administration.

Another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,” a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest. They are among the people who have been killed as protests roiled American cities in the week since 46-year-old George Floyd died when a white officer jammed his knee into the back of the black man’s neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of chaos engulfing cities across America, from heavy-handed riot police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black families to lose more members of their community amid the unrest. Dozens more have been hurt in various altercations — vehicles plowing into crowds, police officers suffering head injuries and broken bones and protesters ending up in emergency rooms with a variety of injuries from the melees. The death toll and circumstances surrounding the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know about the cases so far: LOUISVILLE As local police and the National Guard sought to disperse a crowd early Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing the owner of a barbecue restaurant, David McAtee. The mayor has since terminated the city’s police chief after finding out that officers on the scene did not activate their body cameras. The state police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. The 53-year-old McAtee was an African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by. “We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known Barbecue man.” The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd’s killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home. OAKLAND A federal law enforcement officer was providing security at the federal courthouse in Oakland during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically injured in the shooting. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers and employed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service; they were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional district north of Los Angeles. INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed over the weekend amid unrest in Indianapolis, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as “Mr. Indianapolis” and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after his graduation. He also was a prominent businessman in the city and ran multiple nightclubs. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.” The circumstances of his shooting weren’t immediately clear but some media reports said it happened near an apartment where he lived. It also occurred the same night that an 18-year-old man also was fatally shot as protests broke out in the city. MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, a 43-year-old black man was fatally shot outside a pawn shop as rioting broke out last week in Minneapolis and then spread nationally. The owner of the pawnshop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Calvin L. Horton Jr. Police say they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during unrest. OMAHA, NEBRASKA A 22-year-old black man was killed after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two bars in downtown Omaha. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including James Scurlock, approach bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people are seen on the video tackling Gardner, who ended up on his back and fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen tackling Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges, calling the shooting self-defense. DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot. CHICAGO SUBURB Two people were killed during unrest Monday in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania did not provide details about those who were killed but said it happened amid protests there.",0.0
1623505105,2020-06-02 11:15:00,U.S. cities erupt in more violence amid threats from Trump,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/06/02/breaking-news/u-s-cities-erupt-in-more-violence-amid-threats-from-trump/,en,False,"politics and government, united states politics and government, demonstrations and riots",39573,HonululuAdvertiser,http://www.staradvertiser.com/,"WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump today turned up the pressure on governors to quell the violence set off by the death of George Floyd, demanding New York call up the National Guard to stop the “lowlifes and losers.” As cities around the U.S. witnessed a seventh straight night of both peaceful demonstrations and bursts of theft, vandalism and attacks on police, the president amplified his hard-line calls of a day earlier, in which he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast! Don’t make the same horrible and deadly mistake you made with the Nursing Homes!!!” In New York on Monday night, people smashed shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breached the doors of Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street despite the first curfew in the city in decades. Police said nearly 700 people were arrested and several officers injured in the overnight violence. New York and other cities braced for more trouble after nightfall Tuesday, with Mayor Bill de Blasio extending an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He said he would do that with the help of community leaders, urging them to step forward: “Create peace. … Stand up.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them. De Blasio has said he does not want the Guard, and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said he will not send it into the city against the mayor’s wishes. During the violence that gripped communities from coast to coast again on Monday night, police officers were shot, run over and showered with rocks and bottles. In Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city, Mayor Jim Kenney described a chaotic night in which one person was killed attempting to use explosives to open an ATM, a gun shop owner fatally shot a would-be thief, and a 19-year-old died of injuries during looting. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. In Atlanta, police fired tear gas at demonstrators. In Nashville, more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters. And at a demonstration in Buffalo, New York, an SUV plowed into a group of officers, injuring three. An officer was shot and gravely wounded as police tried to disperse a crowd outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “I fear for my safety every time I get in the car to go for a drive. I fear of getting pulled over. I fear for all 10 of my brothers’ and sisters’ lives, for my parents’ lives!” 19-year-old Amari Burroughs of Parkland, Florida, said Tuesday as she prepared for another protest. “My goal is to use my voice and my leadership to make this world safer so that one day I can bring children here and won’t have to fear for their safety.” More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Democratic governors and mayors rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, questioning whether the federal government has such authority and warning that such a step would be incendiary. De Blasio said military troops would create “a dangerous scenario,” while Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock likewise warned such a move would just lead to more violence and destruction. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” they said in a statement. A senior White House official said Tuesday that despite Trump’s threats, the goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. The president is not rushing to use the Insurrection Act to send in the military, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The unrest in Minneapolis, meanwhile, appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes, even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired. Floyd’s family was expected to join a march in Houston today. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. In Atlanta, six officers were charged Tuesday after a video showed authorities dragging two young people from a car during protests. Sending the military into the states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But some state officials asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

By the time the workers paused Tuesday morning, little was left of a spire that had become a lightning rod for controversy in recent years and a focal point for local protesters outraged by George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis. On Sunday, the obelisk — known formally as the Confederate Sailors and Soldiers Monument — was the site of a speech from Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, who pleaded with the crowd. Some protesters had already vandalized the monument and toppled another statue in the park, that one of former Confederate officer Charles Linn. Woodfin asked that demonstrators refrain from trying to tear down the much larger monument — so that his government could do it instead. ""Allow me to finish the job for you,"" the mayor told a crowd behind his mask and a megaphone. And he persuaded them to give him until midday Tuesday to pull the monument down. ""I wanted you to hear it directly from me. But I need you to stand down."" On Monday, Woodfin declared a state of emergency and implemented a curfew for the city, citing the previous night's protests during which police arrested at least two dozen people. Birmingham isn't the only city reckoning with its Confederate past in the aftermath of Floyd's death. Since the release of a video showing the black man's arrest in Minneapolis, during which a white officer plants a knee on Floyd's neck, protesters in several cities and towns below the Mason-Dixon Line have directed their frustration — and sometimes vandalism — toward local Confederate monuments. In Alexandria, Va., a statue commemorating Confederate soldiers came down Tuesday morning. It was removed a month earlier than scheduled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy due to fears of vandalism, according to The Washington Post. Alexandria, like all great cities, is constantly changing and evolving. pic.twitter.com/CZTjlOkpfT — Justin Wilson (@justindotnet) June 2, 2020 This week's move likely isn't the final chapter in the Birmingham monument's story, which was knotty well before the latest spasm of unrest trained attention back on it. Woodfin's predecessor, William Bell, ordered the memorial partly hidden with plywood screens in 2017 following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued the city, citing a violation of a state law, the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, which protects against the relocation or alteration of Confederate symbols that have been up for more than four decades. A unanimous state Supreme Court decision last fall sided with the monument's supporters, bringing the plywood down and assessing a fine of $25,000 against the city of Birmingham. Now Marshall has threatened another lawsuit over the city's move. ""Should the City of Birmingham proceed with the removal of the monument in question, based upon multiple conversations I have had today,"" the attorney general said in a statement issued Monday, ""city leaders understand I will perform the duties assigned to me by the [Alabama Memorial Preservation] Act to pursue a new civil complaint against the City.""

Republicans are particularly interested in the decision-making inside the Obama-Biden administration. Further, the Senate Homeland Security Committee late last month approved a subpoena along party lines for Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board.

Rick Scott, R-Fla. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, accused the committee's chairman, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., of abusing his power to aid Trump.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Senate Republicans are launching investigations involving the Obama administration and President Obama's vice president, the presumptive Democratic nominee this time, Joe Biden. Today the Senate Judiciary Committee is beginning hearings on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. Republicans are also investigating what they claim is questionable dealings by the Biden family, although there's no evidence to support those CLAIMS. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis has this preview. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Senate Republicans haven't always shared President Trump's interest in investigating Joe Biden. Those days are over. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK SCOTT: The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the United States, who is currently trying to be president, got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $30,000 - or $80,000 a month. DAVIS: Florida Senator Rick Scott joined every Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month to vote for a subpoena of Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. A spokesman for the Biden campaign has accused Republicans of, quote, ""running a political errand"" for the president. This allegation is at the heart of Trump's impeachment. The president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and unfounded theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and Trump was impeached for abuse of power for making the ask. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans now using the Senate to try to boost Trump's reelection chances. Here's California Senator Kamala Harris.

It's a primary election date that was already going to be a challenge for election officials due to health concerns, even before nationwide unrest led to curfew orders in conflict with polling place hours in some places. In Washington, D.C., as well as the eight states voting Tuesday, the vast majority of ballots are expected to be mailed in. In Montana, for instance, election officials mailed every active registered voter a ballot. But the in-person voting options that are also required to be offered in many places create a unique problem. In Philadelphia, for instance, officials are trying to reassure voters they won't be arrested for voting in the Pennsylvania primary if the city decides to extend a 6 p.m. curfew to Tuesday. Polling places will stay open in the city until 8 p.m. ""Philly residents will not be arrested or prosecuted for going to or coming from voting tomorrow,"" District Attorney Larry Krasner told NPR member station WHYY on Monday. ""No curfew is going to interfere with any voter going to the polls. Please do not let these circumstances dissuade you."" Similarly, the District of Columbia's Board of Elections announced that vote centers, which are scheduled to be open until 8 p.m., would not be affected by a 7 p.m. curfew order in the city. ""Voters at Vote Centers and election workers are permitted to be at Vote Centers at 7, and are allowed a reasonable amount of time to get home,"" the board tweeted Monday evening. Across the country, jurisdictions are also having to adjust their in-person voting options to reduce health risks and accommodate massive poll worker shortages. The District is maintaining 20 polling places as a result of the pandemic, as opposed to its usual 144, and Philadelphia is also offering about a fifth of its normal locations. In Rhode Island, election officials are providing voters with ""one-time use stylus/pen combination devices"" to check in on electronic machines, and vote on paper. The secretary of state's office issued a seven-page report detailing how precincts should be organized and cleaned. Beyond the logistical concerns, the next question is simply whether people will be motivated to vote despite the obstacles, especially now that the Democratic presidential primary is all but wrapped up. ""We really are in uncharted territory for voting in America,"" Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the Voting Rights Project with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said on a call with reporters Tuesday. ""We won't know the impact of the challenges we're facing until much later."" Her organization runs a hotline (866-OUR-VOTE) that voters can call with questions or issues, and she said they received almost 3,000 calls in the past week. On Tuesday, the organization has fielded calls about Indiana voters facing long lines in Indianapolis, Maryland voters who say they did not receive their absentee ballots on time, and Pennsylvania voters confused by precinct changes. Johnson-Blanco called it the ""first super Tuesday of the COVID era,"" and she said that any problems encountered could be clues to issues that should be expected to sprout up again in the general election in November.

The latest gains, which followed a rally in global stocks, were driven by optimism that the global economy will begin to recover as governments gradually allow businesses that were closed due to the coronavirus outbreak to reopen. The S&P 500 closed 0.8% higher after spending much of the morning wavering. Technology, industrial and health care sector stocks accounted for a big slice of the gains. Energy stocks far outpaced the rest of the market as the price of crude oil rose again. Bond yields rose, another sign of ebbing pessimism among investors. So far, Wall Street’s momentum has not been derailed by the wave of daily unrest across the U.S. that began last week in Minneapolis as a protest over police brutality. Cities across the country have been rocked by violence and destruction for seven days in a row, drawing threats from the White House to send troops in to put down the unrest. “The market action seems to have a lot more to do with people’s confidence about the economic reopening,” said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “It’s happening irrespective to what we’re seeing socially across the country right now.” The S&P 500 gained 25.09 points to 3,080.82. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 267.63 points, or 1.1%, to 25,742.65. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology companies, added 56.33 points, or 0.6%, to 9,608.37. The index had been down 0.8% in the early going. Smaller company stocks had some of the biggest gains. The Russell 2000 index picked up 12.84 points, or 0.9%, to 1,418.21. NASA astronauts launched into space by SpaceX on Saturday rang the opening bell from the International Space Station early today to kick off trading on the Nasdaq. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus knocked the market into a staggering 34% skid in February and March. The S&P 500 is now down 9% from its all-time high in February. Investors are hoping that the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon, as governments around the country and around the world slowly lift the restrictions that left broad swaths of the U.S. economy at a standstill beginning in March. In Europe, France’s CAC 40 jumped 2% today as the country opened restaurants, cafes, parks and beaches and launched a contract tracing app to help keep tabs on new contagions. Germany’s DAX, which had been closed Monday, caught up with previous global markets’ gains and surged 3.7%. Britain’s FTSE 100 added 0.9%. Markets in Asia closed broadly higher. While more countries and sectors are reopening, economic activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. Meanwhile, investors continue to keep an eye out for any signs that the reopening of the economy is leading to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. Tokyo had 34 new confirmed cases today. The daily numbers had dropped below 20 recently. Even so, Wall Street is betting that the U.S. government and others will not move to close the economy again even if there is a pickup in new cases. “There’s just a lack of appetite for a potential re-shutdown in the event that the virus accelerates from here,” Hainlin said. Bond yields were mostly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.68% from 0.66% late Monday. Oil prices rose. Benchmark U.S. crude oil for July delivery rose $1.37 to settle at $36.81 a barrel today. Brent crude oil for August delivery rose $1.25 to $39.57 a barrel.",0.0

House Democrats are sorting through dozens of proposals to address policing issues, including excessive use of force and racial profiling. ""It is time, it is time for us to address the concerns that were being expressed by the protesters,"" Pelosi said at a press event at the Capitol Tuesday. ""This is not a single incident. We know this is a pattern of behavior. and we also know the history that brings us to this sad place."" Democrats hope to calm the increasingly incendiary atmosphere in the country over Floyd's death by finding ways to address the underlying systemic problems enraging protesters in the streets. There is some degree of bipartisan support for reviewing the tactics that led to Floyd's death. Many Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have acknowledged what McConnell called ""egregious wrongs."" McConnell said Tuesday there could be a role for Congress to play here. ""It's certainly something that we need to take a look at,"" McConnell told reporters. ""We'll be talking to our colleagues about what, if anything, is appropriate for us to do in the wake of what's going on."" But the discussion has often become entwined with public outcry over President Trump's handling of the unrest and his threat to use military force to quell protests. Pelosi said Floyd's killing ""happened in broad daylight, it happened for all the world to see. A knee to the neck, not only by the perpetrator of that murder but by three officers observing it."" Congress has often struggled to address policing issues. Many decisions about policing tactics, training and strategies are determined at the state and local level. Pelosi is asking members of the Congressional Black Caucus to sort through the ideas and find legislation that can pass the House where Democrats have enough votes for approval without GOP support. Among the options is a 2015 bill introduced by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that would outlaw the use of chokeholds in policing. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has endorsed that idea. Democrats are hoping to reach an agreement quickly. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters he could call lawmakers back to Washington to vote before their scheduled return on June 30. Hoyer said that he has been in contact with the Congressional Black Caucus over the last four days and that it is considering more than 50 pieces of legislation, including a proposal to end qualified immunity for police officers, or their legal protection shield for certain actions. Democrats also plan to try to force the Senate to go on record condemning Trump for ""ordering federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against Americans who were peaceably protesting"" Monday outside the White House. The resolution, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would also affirm the rights of free assembly and protest while condemning looting. The measure is unlikely to pass as it requires unanimous consent to be approved. Republicans, including McConnell, have largely focused on calling for protests to remain peaceful without directly discussing the conflict at the White House. ""It is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace in our streets and peace in our communities,"" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""We need to unite against these violent rioters who seek only to aggrandize themselves and further damage a nation that needs healing."" Most Senate Republicans declined Tuesday to discuss the tear gas incident at the White House when reporters on Capitol Hill asked them about it. Some avoided the question; others said they didn't see the incident. Those who did speak to reporters mostly focused on condemning violent protests. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has announced a June 16 hearing on police use of force. ""We intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd's death, with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation,"" Graham said in a statement Friday. ",0.0

The incident, during which officers used stun guns on the pair and pulled them from their vehicle, received national attention after bystanders recorded and posted video to social media. ""I agree with Mayor [Keisha Lance] Bottoms and I agree with our police chief, Erika Shields, when they both have conveyed in so many separate ways that the conduct in this incident — it is not indicative of the way that we treat people in the city of Atlanta,"" Fulton County, Ga., District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters Tuesday. Howard's office has filed charges — mostly assorted aggravated assault and battery counts — against a half-dozen officers involved in the arrest: Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Streeter and Gardner have been fired from the force since Saturday's confrontation, while three others have been placed on desk duty. Howard said the charges are backed up by extensive interviews with the young couple, Taniyah Pilgrim and Messiah Young, as well as video evidence from bystanders and the officers' body camera footage. The district attorney played one such video from a bodycam. During the video, officers on foot confront Pilgrim and Young, who had been passing them in a car. After the two black occupants appear to drive away briefly from the officers, Pilgrim and Young stop — at which point the officers swarm the vehicle. Stun guns are used on both occupants, who are ripped from the car over Pilgrim's screams to stop. Pilgrim was never charged; Young was charged with attempting to elude officers before the charge was dismissed at the request of the mayor, who apologized. ""We just need to see that all officers are held accountable, and that there really is change moving forward within the culture of policing,"" Young said at a news conference. Atlanta and other cities have seen widespread protests over the past week after another video — that of George Floyd's arrest in Minneapolis — catalyzed outrage over violence in policing. Floyd died after Derek Chauvin — who has since been fired from the Minneapolis police and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter — dug a knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Video of the incident involving Pilgrim and Young caused a stir of its own. ""We understand our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" the Atlanta mayor said Sunday, describing the video as ""disturbing on many levels."" ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.""  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: In dozens of cities yesterday, large, mostly peaceful demonstrations devolved into chaos. In Nashville, Miami, Seattle and Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, New York and, frankly, too many other places to name, protesters expressed their rage at the death of George Floyd, police brutality and racism. There were violent confrontations with police, and police cracked down, also violently. There were also mass arrests and injuries among demonstrators, journalists and police. At least a dozen major cities declared curfews. Others called on the National Guard, which has been historically used in response to major civil unrest. There were scenes of National Guard marching through some residential neighborhoods, ordering people to stay inside. We go now to Los Angeles, where members of the National Guard were also deployed overnight and a curfew was put in place as a state of emergency was declared. NPR's Nathan Rott is in LA, and he joins us now. Nate, walk us through what happened yesterday. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: So there was a massive peaceful protest that started around noon yesterday. It was in the Fairfax district in west L.A., which is kind of a trendy neighborhood with high-end retail and a big outdoor mall. And people were protesting against police violence, as they are all over the country. They were memorializing George Floyd, the black man who died after being pinned to the ground by Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, by all accounts, it was peaceful, respectful until a little later in the afternoon, when we started seeing reports of police cars being set on fire and just a total breakdown in the situation. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This often happens at protests, right? When things shift as things go into the night. Do we know what happened? ROTT: Yeah. And that - honestly, that was a little surprising, Lulu. Usually, these, like, shifts do happen at night. And this started in broad daylight in mid-afternoon, which is, I think, very concerning to a lot of the city officials. So, you know, on social media, people were blaming the police for escalating tensions, for responding with tear gas and the sort of militarized riot gear that has become so commonplace around the country. City officials have so far blamed bad eggs in the crowd for setting things off, and that's something we've been hearing in a lot of places - that it's a small group of people who are agitating these situations. Of course, that's now been politicized, even with the U.S. attorney general blaming anarchists and leftists without, you know, providing any proof of that. But it's really hard to say what makes this situations shift. Tensions are obviously very high, so it doesn't take much to spark something. GARCIA-NAVARRO: No, it doesn't. We saw videos of looting and fires in many cities around the country last night. That was also the case in LA, right? ROTT: Yeah. A number of retail stores in that Fairfax area were broken into. Goods were stolen. Some were set on fire. I know firefighters were dealing with those fires throughout the night. That prompted LA's mayor, Eric Garcetti, to announce a citywide curfew, which caught a lot of people off guard because he announced it an hour before it went into effect. But here he is explaining why they did it and alluding to violent protests in 1992 following Rodney King. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: We've seen this before in Los Angeles. When the violence escalates, no one wins. And so everybody has to be responsible for owning this moment. Whether you wear a badge or whether you hold a sign, I'm asking all of Los Angeles to take a deep breath and to step back for a moment. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Does it seem like the curfew worked briefly? ROTT: Yeah, the crowds started to thin out even before the curfew started. I know in other parts of the state - Sacramento, San Diego - there were large confrontations between crowds and police. I think, you know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Nate Rott in LA. Thank you so much. ROTT: Yeah. Thank you, Lulu.

Another was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who provided free meals to officers. Yet another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,” a former star football player. They are among those killed as protests have roiled American cities in the week since the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis officer jammed a knee into his neck. The deaths, as well as widespread peaceful protests, have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of heavy-handed police tactics, vandalism and arson. Dozens have been injured in the chaos. Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black communities. The death toll and circumstances of the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know so far: ST. LOUIS A 77-year-old retired St. Louis police captain who served 38 years on the force was shot and killed by looters at a pawn shop early today, authorities said. David Dorn was found dead on the sidewalk in front of the ransacked store. Police have not released details about what led to the shooting, and no one has been arrested. The shooting apparently was streamed on Facebook Live but has been taken down. It came on a violent night in St. Louis, which saw four officers shot, businesses burned and ransacked, and people pelting officers with rocks hours following a peaceful protest. Dorn was a friend of the pawn shop’s owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, wife Ann Marie Dorn told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. David Dorn’s personality was “bigger than life,” said former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch. “He was a fun guy, a happy guy.” Dorn retired in October 2007 and then became police chief of Moline Acres, a small town north of St. Louis. LOUISVILLE Police and the National Guard troops trying to clear a crowd Monday heard gunshots and returned fire, killing David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant. The mayor fired the police chief after finding out officers did not turn on their body-worn cameras. State police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating. McAtee was a 53-year-old African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by his restaurant. “We lost a wonderful citizen,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man.” Acting police Chief Robert Schroeder said today that video from security cameras at McAtee’s business and an adjoining store showed McAtee firing a gun as officers approached. “This video does not provide all the answers. But we are releasing it to provide transparency. It does not answer every question, including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired,” Schroeder said. The protests also have centered on the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her Louisville home in March as narcotics detectives serving a search warrant knocked down her door. No drugs were found. OAKLAND, CALIF. A federal officer was providing security at a U.S. courthouse during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle. Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically wounded. It wasn’t immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti. No one has been arrested. Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers employed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service. They were monitoring a nearby protest. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant congressional seat north of Los Angeles. INDIANAPOLIS Two people were killed this past weekend amid unrest, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University. Beaty was known as “Mr. Indianapolis” and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after graduation. He also was a prominent businessman, running multiple nightclubs. “I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.” The circumstances of Beaty’s shooting weren’t immediately clear, but some media reports said it happened near his apartment. It came the same night an 18-year-old man was fatally shot as protests erupted in the city. DAVENPORT, IOWA Police are investigating the deaths of 22-year-old Italia Kelly, who was shot Monday while leaving a protest outside a Walmart, and of a man found near where suspects exchanged gunfire with police in the city of 100,000 people across the Mississippi River from Illinois. Kelly and a friend were getting in a vehicle to leave because a protest had turned unruly when she was struck in the back by a bullet, said her aunt, Amy Hale of Atchison, Kan. No arrests have been made. “She was always smiling, always laughing. That’s why it’s so sad that she was taken in such a violent way,” Hale said. “That is not Italia. She was the bright, bubbly big personality in the room.” Separately, authorities said an officer was “ambushed” with gunfire Sunday. Another officer shot back, and the suspects fled but were arrested. Near where the officer was wounded, police found a man shot to death and a handgun under his body. His identity wasn’t released. Police said surveillance video shows that the man and some of the arrested suspects were involved in a shooting outside a jewelry store hours earlier. They were casing the business when other cars arrived and multiple people fired shots at each other, police said. MINNEAPOLIS In what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, Calvin L. Horton Jr. was fatally shot outside a pawn shop last week. The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Horton, a 43-year-old black man. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood. The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during the unrest. OMAHA, NEB. James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man, was killed Saturday after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two downtown bars. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including Scurlock, approach white bar owner Jake Gardner. Two people shove Gardner to the ground, and he fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen jumping on Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock. Authorities have declined to press charges in the death, calling the shooting self-defense. But Gardner could still face misdemeanor gun charges because his concealed carry permit for the gun had expired, the police chief said. DETROIT A 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone opened fire and then ran away.

The hashtag was adopted from music artists like Rihanna, Quincy Jones, Yoko Ono and the Rolling Stones to encourage solidarity. Black screens piled up on social media all day, but the downfall of the hashtag was the confusion of whether it was made to silence black voices and clutter the #BlackLivesMatter page. That specific social media hashtag is where people read updates from other states about the demonstrations, information on petetions and donations, education on police arrests and what to safetly wear at a protest. Many Hawaii residents have joined the social media movement of the day. Honolulu resident Jordan Jackson, said she saw the posts, but she wasn’t sure where it came from. “It’s certainly a nice sentiment, and it’s much easier to weed out who on my timeline really is for my community,” she said. “The main issue I’ve seen is that a lot of people are using the #BlackLivesMatter on their posts, which is clogging up the valuable information others might need in that same hashtag. In that sense, it becomes contradictory.” Multiple complaints were made on social media, while trying to inform users to prevent them from using the #BlackLivesMatter. If a social media user posts a black screen using #BlackLivesMatter, it will remain on the page until the user completely removes the post. Amanda Seales, daytime talk show host from The Real, tweeted her take on the #BlackOutTuesday. “Y’all #BlackOutTuesday is not about black voices being silent,” she tweeted. “It is about amplifying black voices that blackout white noise. … Keep posting.”",0.0

""Violence has no place and violence must be addressed,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told NPR's All Things Considered. ""But there is no reason for the U.S. military to be called out for this."" Pelosi was referring to a threat Trump made Monday evening in the Rose Garden at the White House. ""If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents,"" Trump declared in a brief statement, ""then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."" As the president spoke, federal officers in riot gear near the White House launched tear gas and pepper spray at peaceful protesters. Shortly thereafter, Trump strode through a park cleared of the demonstrators to pose with a Bible in front of St. John's Church, leading a group of officials that included Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Walking like lapdogs behind a five-time draft dodging coward who is more interested in looking like a leader than actually being one,"" Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who lost both legs in combat as a military helicopter pilot in Iraq, said of Esper and Milley, ""sends a horrifying message to our troops — including our black and brown troops — that our military's leaders will not protect them from unlawful orders."" In a statement on Twitter, Duckworth added, ""We cannot allow any Commander in Chief to put our Armed Forces' reputation as the last institution Americans can trust and respect at risk by using them unlawfully and putting them in a position of exacerbating the divisions driving our union apart. ... Threatening military force and imprisonment against Americans exercising their Constitutional rights is not Presidential, it's tin-pot dictatorial."" But Trump does appear to have the power unilaterally to dispatch active-duty soldiers to trouble spots in the United States. The 1807 Insurrection Act authorizes a U.S. president to deploy military forces for domestic emergencies. The law was updated in 2006 to include natural disasters and terrorist attacks as grounds for sending federal troops to restore order. While condemning looting and vandalism that rocked Providence, R.I., on Monday evening, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, called Trump's threats to use military force against American citizens ""irresponsible and destablizing."" ""The job of bringing calm will take law enforcement and the community working together,"" Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an emailed statement Tuesday. ""It will not come from recklessly invoking the Insurrection Act."" The Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee told reporters Tuesday he plans to convene an in-person congressional hearing next week to press the Pentagon's top two officials on Trump's possible invocation of the Insurrection Act. ""We need to hear from Chairman Milley and Secretary Esper as to exactly how they intend to use the U.S. military trying to deal with this domestic crisis,"" U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said on a video conference call. ""If the president is basically threatening to use the U.S. military to go in and enforce the law in U.S. cities, that runs the risk of an extreme escalation in violence and of a hugely disruptive practice."" Asked about Milley wearing camouflage fatigues in public Monday night, Smith said the nation's highest military officer may have misread the message being sent. ""The optics of him being in uniform out there might not have been so bad if we didn't have the president out there talking about going to war with the country and using the military and using overwhelming force,"" Smith said of Milley. In a conference call Monday, Trump told the nation's governors that Milley was ""a fighter, a war hero, a lot of victories and no losses and he hates to see the way it's being handled in the various states, and I just put him in charge."" Milley, whom Trump said was on the call, said nothing. But a senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that the Insurrection Act had not been invoked by Trump and insisted that Milley's role and authorities have not changed.

Police and National Guard troops continued a heavy lockdown in Minneapolis, where the death in police custody of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, ignited the first protests. Gov. Tim Walz announced civil rights charges against the Minneapolis Police Department and said his administration would investigate whether there had been systemic discrimination against people of color over the past 10 years. An estimated 10,000 people gathered peacefully outside the State Capitol as a Black Hawk helicopter flew behind the freshly gilded dome. National Guard troops applauded, handed out water and sometimes dropped to their knees in a show of support for the protesters. U.S. troops positioned military vehicles across Washington and a crowd of protesters at least twice the size of the day before gathered near the White House. It shrank after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew, but more than 1,000 protesters remained, facing police officers across a tall chain-link fence erected overnight. Thousands more gathered in the heart of Hollywood, Calif., this evening as police officers filed out of trucks and formed a skirmish line. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York extended the city’s 8 p.m. curfew — which some groups of protesters again ignored a day after looting in Manhattan — through Sunday. He also promised to take action against the “outsiders,” “gang members” and “common criminals” he said were responsible for looting and violence. “I know we will overcome this. I want to be abundantly clear,” the mayor said, warning: “We will have a tough few days.” In more than a week of protests, the violence has continued to escalate, and both the police and protesters have been victims. Officers in New York City and Buffalo, New York, were plowed over by cars and injured. After protests in the St. Louis area turned violent, four police officers were shot and a 77-year-old retired police captain was shot and killed by looters at a pawnshop. And in Las Vegas, a police officer was in critical condition today after being shot as the authorities tried to disperse crowds pelting them with bottles and rocks. But protesters, too, have been caught in the increasingly forceful law enforcement crackdowns. In Atlanta, six police officers were charged with using excessive force after video footage showed them stopping two college students in a car Saturday night, firing Tasers at them and dragging them out of their vehicle. “The conduct involved in this incident is not indicative of the way that we treat people in the city of Atlanta,” Paul L. Howard Jr., the district attorney, said in a news conference today. President Donald Trump has pushed on states to crack down even harder on the protests, leaving demonstrators debating how to respond to a growing police and military presence in the streets. As the demographics of the movement have expanded to include a far more diverse population, the goals have also broadened. Some demonstrators are demanding that all four officers involved in Floyd’s death be thrown in jail, not just the single officer charged last week. “All four,” they shouted at protests. Many others are calling for the entire system of inequality that they view as the ultimate cause of Floyd’s death to be torn down and rebuilt. Outside the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, a racially diverse crowd of hundreds has gathered nightly, with people chanting against institutions they feel contribute to racial and socioeconomic divides — including law enforcement and capitalism. Those carrying signs cursing Amazon and Jeff Bezos have stood alongside others demanding an end to police brutality. “What feels different about right now is people are angry for themselves in a way that we did not see outside of black people four years ago,” said Sharhonda Bossier, who began participating in protests affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013. In some cities, protesters worried that violence could overshadow their message and have engaged in self-policing to prevent emotions from escalating. On Monday afternoon, Floyd’s brother Terrence visited the spot where his brother was killed, near an intersection that has turned into a peaceful gathering spot for protesters. One of the first things Terrence Floyd did was criticize the looting, window-smashing and arson that has accompanied some of the protests. “If I’m not over here blowing up stuff, if I’m not over here messing up my community, then what are you all doing?” he asked, his voice growing louder. “What are you all doing? You all doing nothing! Because that’s not going to bring my brother back at all.” Instead, Terrence Floyd, who came to Minneapolis from Brooklyn, urged people to research political candidates and vote for change. Some particularly uncomfortable conflicts between white and black protesters have reflected the very divide that protesters are hoping to upend. In Baltimore on Saturday night, Denicia Baker was chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot!” outside City Hall with a group of about 200 protesters when two young white men wearing black T-shirts and ski masks started kicking and shaking protective fencing put up by the police. “Stop!” Baker yelled at the men, recording the episode on her cellphone. “When you do that, they don’t go after you. They come after us.” During a heated exchange, one of the young men responded: “They’re going to kill you anyway.” Eventually, other protesters removed the two white men. Baker said she suspected they only wanted to stir up trouble. In many of the demonstrations, white protesters say they have tried to hang back and listen or play a supporting role by passing out water, hand sanitizer and snacks. Some have gone as far as to use their bodies to shield black protesters as the police are bearing down on them. But some escalations led by white protesters have not been welcome. “If you show up in these spaces across the country, you are a guest,” said Takirra Winfield Dixon, a former Obama administration official and activist based in Baltimore. “You don’t necessarily have the right to pick up a brick and throw it through a window.” In Washington, D.C., protesters squabbled on Monday over how to respond as law enforcement wielding pepper spray advanced upon them. Some shouted through the cloud of chemicals that the group should stand strong; others pleaded to fall back for safety. Later in the night, tensions rose again after Army helicopters descended to rooftop level, kicking up dirt and debris and snapping tree branches in a maneuver often used in combat zones to scare away insurgents. Some young people wearing masks responded by throwing rocks at storefronts, while others appeared intent on continuing to march peacefully. In some cases, the debate among protesters over how to respond to the police breaks down along generational lines. Just before midnight Sunday, rumors swirled that the authorities were about to break up protesters near the intersection where George Floyd died. A black woman and two white men, all in their 20s, hatched a plan to set fire to a barrier of garbage containers and wooden palettes to prevent the police from moving in. “Hey, do you have flammables in the car?” the woman asked the men. They ran off, returning with plastic bottles filled with liquid, which they poured over the wood and containers. At that point, a group of people hurried over, telling them to stop. One of them was the woman’s father. “What you’re doing — they understand that violence,” he said angrily. “There ain’t a vehicle that they have that can’t run through fire.” The woman looked down. “You’re my daughter. I got you,” he said, and she walked away.",0.0

Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless."" The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. We’re done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday's protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,"" he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,"" she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump's threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower's use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired.",0.0

It has become a ritual — a somewhat inexplicable one, as TBS’ Conan O’Brien noted — for these comics to come on the air after acts of terrorism, school shootings or other national traumas to try and make sense of them for their audiences. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes, even after he stopped moving. “Today feels very different,” O’Brien said Monday night. “It doesn’t feel right to talk about my feelings of sadness and anger. That truly feels inadequate and somehow wrong.” Instead, O’Brien said it was important to listen to people who have direct experience with “our national crisis,” the fact that much of the black community in the United States doesn’t feel safe, seen or heard. He brought on CNN’s Van Jones as a guest. That’s one thing O’Brien had in common with Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, James Corden and Seth Meyers: They all invited black guests or, in Corden’s case, collaborator Reggie Watts, to talk about the issue after saying their piece. Trevor Noah of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” brought a different personal experience, having grown up in South Africa with a white father and black mother. He offered a serious, expansive monologue that touched upon the coronavirus’ impact on minorities, the New York woman who recently told police she was being threatened by an African American man in Central Park, and George Floyd. To feel threatened by law enforcement feels to many blacks like they’re being held to a standard that some responsible for enforcing laws don’t adhere to themselves, he said. Noah said he understands the mentality that leads to looting when many whites can’t. “Try to imagine how it feels to be a black person when they watch themselves be looted every day,” Noah said, “because that’s what’s happening in America. Police in America are looting black bodies.” NBC’s Fallon, like all of the hosts speaking from home because of COVID-19 restrictions, noted how the Floyd story coincided with his own personal issues. Fallon recently apologized after stories emerged about how he appeared in blackface to impersonate Chris Rock in a 2000 “Saturday Night Live” skit. He said he was advised to keep quiet when people talked about him online, but he realized he had to talk about it. “What that small gesture did for me was break my own silence,” the “Tonight” show host said. “Staying silent was the biggest crime that people like me can do.” “We need to start saying ‘it not OK,’ more than just one day on Twitter,” said Fallon, who later spoke on the air with NAACP President Derrick Johnson. Unlike the others, Colbert and Meyers mixed jokes into their monologues, but there was no mistaking their messages. Denying human rights and dignity for any people will ultimately destroy society, said Colbert, the late-night ratings leader on CBS’ “Late Show.” “Take it upon yourself to be a leader and set an example of the kind of country you want to live in,” he said. “That might mean going down to a protest or making a donation, or having a tense conversation about race. “You’re not going to get that from the White House,” he said. “So we need to step up and provide it ourselves. Because America is officially BYOP, bring your own president.” Meyers was sickened by the amount of money local communities spend on policing. “We spend more on the system that punishes and devalues black lives than we do on the things that reaffirm and value black lives and allows people to live lives of safety, decency and health,” he said. Corden, from Britain, seemed shaken on his CBS show. “I feel hopeless,” he said. “I don’t have the answers. But I do want to do more. I want to learn more and let that be a start.” ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel aired a rerun Monday.",0.0

He has never before been so isolated and ignored, even mocked. In Europe, after years of snubs and U.S. unilateralism, America’s traditional allies have stopped looking to him for leadership, no longer trust that this president will offer them much and are turning their backs on him. That was evidenced most obviously this week by the decision of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, not to attend the Group of 7 meeting that Trump wanted so badly in Washington this month to show that the virus was behind him and the world was returning to normal. Merkel cited the lingering threat of the virus, but a senior German official who spoke on the condition of anonymity made clear that she had other reasons to decline: She believed that proper diplomatic preparations had not been made; she did not want to be part of an anti-China display; she opposed Trump’s idea of inviting the Russian president, Vladimir Putin; she did not want to be seen as interfering in U.S. domestic politics. And she was shocked by Trump’s sudden, unilateral decision to pull out of the World Health Organization. The divide between Trump and European allies was widening even before U.S. cities were convulsed by rioting. But the chaos on American streets, viewed from abroad, has only reinforced a sense that the conflicts that Trump seems to sow have caught up with him. As Trump threatens to call in the military against his own citizens, he has become a president that some of America’s closest allies prefer to keep at arms’ length, unsure of what he will do next and unwilling to be dragged into his campaign for reelection. “Leaders in allied nations now think that criticizing Trump is to their advantage,” said Marietje Schaake, a former Dutch European legislator, especially now with the unrest in U.S. cities and demonstrations supporting those protests in many European cities, including Amsterdam. Even the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles, felt bold enough Tuesday to say that Europe is ”shocked and appalled” by the police killing of George Floyd. He condemned an ”abuse of power” and “an excessive use of force” and urged the United States to act “in full respect of the law and human rights.” On Monday, as if to underline the U.S. president’s isolation, it was to the Russian president, Putin, that Trump placed a call, in which the two men discussed the virus, trade and “progress toward convening the G-7,” the White House said. Trump invited Putin to the meeting, according to the Kremlin. But if it happens at all, there are doubts that Putin would accept being invited solely as a guest, having been kicked out of the club for his annexation of Crimea and support for insurrection in eastern Ukraine. Trump also called President Jair Bolsonaro, the hard-right leader of Brazil, on Monday. “It all shows just how out of touch Trump is with allies,” said Julianne Smith, a former Obama official now with the German Marshall Fund in Washington. “This is a man isolated at home and abroad. He is trying to find friends in other places, knowing that relations with traditional allies are bad. But there are serious strains even with the authoritarians he admires, like Xi Jinping and even Putin.” Trump “continues to believe allies can be abused and mistreated and that he can order them around and at the same time count on them,” Smith said. “He doesn’t understand that while the U.S. is powerful, it doesn’t always call the shots.” Merkel’s refusal to come to Washington “says a lot about how fed up multiple leaders are around the world, who have seen how little return they’ve gotten on the investments they made into a relationship with Trump,” she said. With the virus and the riots, she added, “now there is a sense of America’s weaknesses being exposed, and a feeling that the emperor has no clothes.” The threads unraveled quickly. As late as Thursday, European and U.S. officials say, Trump’s plans for a Group of 7 summit meeting in Washington were being negotiated with member countries and looked likely to go ahead. Then, Friday, Trump suddenly announced that he was pulling the United States out of the WHO, more than two weeks before his own stated deadline for the decision. As so often in the past, on issues like unilateral U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal or the Paris climate accord or the Open Skies treaty or the sudden ban on air travel from Europe, Trump ignored the views of allies or did not consult them at all. The WHO decision was a surprise to allies, and Merkel quickly said that she would not attend the proposed summit meeting. Since then, both Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada have come out publicly against bringing Russia back into the Group of 7. “For the British and Canadians to say no publicly is highly unusual,” given their closeness to the United States, said Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister. As for Merkel, he said, given the lack of preparation, “the Germans suspected it was just a photo op with Trump in the White House.” Despite allied concerns, the Group of 7 matters, and plans for the meeting were going ahead given a general desire to come up with strong positions on Hong Kong and to try to influence Washington’s policies on the virus, said Thomas Wright of the Brookings Institution. But after the WHO announcement, Merkel decided that “if you’re going unilateral, I’m not going to be there to support you,” Wright said. “The allies all think he’s all over the place and they’ll try to avoid him.” President Emmanuel Macron of France has a more traditional French view, especially toward building an improved relationship with Russia, despite Crimea, given its proximity to the European Union, said Thomas Gomart, director of the French Institute of International Relations. “In France toward Trump is a mix of sadness and anger,” Gomart said. “Our main ally refused to exercise leadership during the corona crisis and is every day more provocative toward its allies and is creating divisions that are very actively exploited by China.” After nearly four years, Trump has no diplomatic accomplishments, Gomart said, listing failures on North Korea, the Middle East, a deterioration of relations with China and no improvement of relations with Russia. Instead, Macron believes that Trump has damaged European security through his unilateral abandonment of the Iran nuclear deal as well as nearly every arms control agreement with Russia.",0.0

Trudeau has long been careful not to criticize Trump as Canada relies on the U.S. for 75 percent of exports. But Trudeau, who is usually quick to answer, paused and struggled to come up with the right words when asked about Trump calling for military action against protesters and the use of tear gas for a photo opportunity. The prime minister avoided mentioning Trump directly. “We all watch in horror and consternation at what is going on the United States,” he said. “It is time to pull people together.” Police violently broke up a peaceful and legal protest by several thousand people in Lafayette Park across from the White House ahead of a speech in the Rose Garden by Trump on Monday. The protesters had gathered following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week earlier. Afterward, Trump strolled out of the White House gates and walked across the cleared Lafayette Park to make a surprise visit to St. John’s Church. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, raised a Bible. He didn’t mention Floyd, the church or the peaceful protesters police had just cleared away. In the same question Trudeau was also asked what message he is sending if he he didn’t comment about Trump’s actions. “Clearly, Trudeau was not expecting this pointed question. I think he was considering whether to respond at all, which could have been taken to mean he was not going to criticize Trump,” said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. “His comments are a criticism of Trump without naming Trump,” he said. Wiseman said Trudeau was wise not to mention Trump directly. “Trudeau is smart enough to know that. Trump has shown that he can blow a fuse even if he isn’t mentioned directly, as happened at the end of the G7,” Wiseman said. Trump vowed to make Canada pay after Trudeau said he wouldn’t be bullied in trade talks at the conclusion of the G7 meeting in Quebec in 2018. Trump called Trudeau “weak” and “dishonest.” He threatened tariffs on cars and slapped them on steel.",0.0

But when the Canadian prime minister was asked what he thought of President Trump's actions to quash a wave of protests across the U.S., Trudeau paused before responding – for 21 seconds as the cameras recorded his awkward silence. During a Tuesday news conference in front of his Ottawa residence, the prime minister fielded this question from a reporter: ""You've been reluctant to comment about the words and actions of the U.S. president. But we do have now Donald Trump calling for military action against protesters. We saw protesters tear-gassed yesterday to make way for a presidential photo-op. I'd like to ask you what you think about that. And, if you don't want to comment, what message do you think you're sending?"" Before answering, the prime minister, sporting a beard and shaggy hair since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, glanced down at his lectern, opened his mouth as if to speak — then paused, shifted his weight and uttered a barely audible ""um"" as birds chirped in the background. ""We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,"" he finally said. ""It is a time to pull people together, but it is a time to listen. ""It is a time to learn what injustices continue despite progress over years and decades. But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we too have our challenges,"" he said. ""That black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day,"" Trudeau continued. ""There is systemic discrimination in Canada, which means our systems treat Canadians of color, Canadians who are racialized, as differently than they do others."" Trudeau typically displays reticence on Trump's actions, keeping in mind the centrality of the U.S.-Canada relationship and their huge cross-border economic interdependence. Canada in recent days has seen relatively small, peaceful protests in solidarity with U.S. demonstrations that first erupted last week in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, Minn. By contrast, the protests in U.S. cities have typically been much larger and have frequently devolved into clashes between police and activists. The Canadian protests supporting Black Lives Matter have sprung up in Montreal, Halifax, Toronto and Regina, the provincial capital of Saskatchewan. At the protest in Regina on Tuesday, where a few hundred people gathered, one of the organizers, Faith Olanipekun, told the CBC that, ""A lot of people here think that Canada isn't racist."" ""So it's important for us to come out, voice our concerns and let people know that we are suffering in Canada just as much as people in the U.S. are suffering,"" Olanipekun said. ",0.0
1624175854,2020-06-03 05:00:00,Ex-Department Of Justice Leader Who Appointed Mueller To Testify In Senate,https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/ex-department-justice-leader-who-appointed-mueller-testify-senate,en,False,"politics and government, united states politics and government, elections, demonstrations and riots",332152,hawaiipublicradio.org,http://hawaiipublicradio.org/,"Updated at 11:56 a.m. ET Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Wednesday that if he knew then what he knows now, he would not have signed his now-infamous application to continue surveillance on an ex-junior aide to Donald Trump. Rosenstein told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he relied on lower-level investigators and attorneys to do the right thing in preparing applications for the secret court that authorizes surveillance on Americans. Now, he said, he recognizes via the subsequent investigations that those investigators and attorneys did not do the right thing — and accordingly, Rosenstein said he wouldn't have signed the application. Watch the hearing live here. The former deputy attorney general defended the overall need for an investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election and said he stood by its findings and much of its work. But he also acknowledged that it has since become clear he and other Justice Department leaders were acting upon incomplete information. In the case of former Trump aide Carter Page, Rosenstein said he remembered an application for renewal, one that that has been submitted before, and one that he believed made a cogent case to continue the surveillance. ""My recollection of it was that it was actually fairly persuasive,"" he said. GOP vows more investigation of Russia investigation Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went ahead with a session Wednesday scheduled before the flare in protests and violence that followed the death of a Minneapolis man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in an incident that reignited long-simmering anger at police in cities across the country. The political context has evolved; Republicans want to tie former Vice President Joe Biden into what they call the abuses of power from the end of the Obama era. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said what he called the ""Obama-Biden administration"" had done ""went right up to the very top"" and was worse than the abuses of President Richard Nixon. Cruz also called Rosenstein ""grossly negligent."" He and Republicans sought answers about what Rosenstein and other Justice Department leaders knew at the time they were making fateful decisions about the FBI's investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which sought to hinder Hillary Clinton and help elect then-candidate Donald Trump. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., rejected Cruz's comparison between Obama and Nixon and said it would ""never stand the test of time."" She also said Graham was wasting everyone's time. ""I have made it very clear that I think that it is absurd we are having this hearing."" Strange days Rosenstein found himself in the center of a political vortex in the spring of 2017, not long after he'd been nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. His boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was a Trump loyalist and had recused himself from the Russian matter. The president had fired FBI Director James Comey. In the midst of that febrile atmosphere, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as a special counsel and continue the Russia investigation. ""I was concerned the public would not have confidence in the investigation and that acting FBI director [at the time] was not the right person to lead it,"" Rosenstein told senators on Wednesday. ""I decided appointment of special counsel was the best way to complete invest and promote public confidence in the conclusions."" Re-look after re-look has verified Mueller's findings about the Russian interference, but the work of the FBI and Justice Department wasn't found to be problem-free. Issues with the FBI investigators involved and their dealings within officialdom, especially with the secret court that oversees government surveillance, have embarrassed the top levels of federal law enforcement. Longtime target Many Republicans have faulted Rosenstein since his earliest days over his appointment of Mueller. Now, Graham has brought Rosenstein back to center stage at a time when Trump and other allies want to link Biden with intelligence collection that involved members of the Trump camp. Graham said he also intends to conduct more interviews and hearings about the investigation, including with planned subpoenas. ""We're going to get to the bottom of it ... this stinks,"" he said. ""This is a sad episode on the history of the FBI."" Biden's camp has rejected the idea there were any abuses and pointed out that there was no way for administration officials to single out Americans in intelligence reporting because their names were hidden, or masked. They were only identified after requests for more information about who was talking with existing targets, Biden's campaign said. That practice is legal and takes place thousands of times per year. Trump and allies have made it the basis of political attacks against Biden and others from that era, as Cruz repeated at Wednesday's hearing. Biden, in turn, has blasted Trump and Republicans for what he calls their attempt to distract attention from the most pressing challenges of the day — first the coronavirus pandemic and now the national unrest over police violence. Democrats, who are in the minority on the Senate Judiciary Committee, took up that theme on Wednesday, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California. She also restated that the findings and much of the work of the Mueller era have been validated. Feinstein emphasized with Rosenstein that the infamous, never-verified Russia dossier was not used as the basis to charge anyone. And Rosenstein underlined what he called the important need to conduct investigations that might not necessarily lead to charges — and that in the case of the Mueller era, no Americans ultimately were charged with conspiring with the Russians who attacked the election. The Justice Department needs to conduct investigations that sometimes don't lead to charges, he said, and in the cases from the Mueller days that did lead to indictments, the work all was solid, he argued. Republicans cited the findings of subsequent investigations about the problems with the use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the actions by people in the FBI and Justice Department. Specifically, Rosenstein signed a request to continue surveillance on the former junior campaign aide to Trump, Page, based on work product that has since been repudiated by internal investigators and the secret surveillance court. Those details didn't become clear to the public until later — or Rosenstein, he said on Wednesday. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., tried to emphasize with Rosenstein that although the Page surveillance application process was flawed, none of the other surveillance conducted in the Russia investigation suffered from the same problems. None of the Page problems invalidate the rest of the Mueller work, Leahy argued. Democrats complained about the use of the time and energy of the Judiciary Committee to execute what Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, R-R.I., called a political errand for Trump. Graham defended the need to excavate the decisions in the Russia investigation and, meanwhile, has sought to show the Judiciary Committee can keep many plates spinning at once. The committee heard from witnesses on Tuesday about the deadly effects of the coronavirus within the federal prison system, and Graham also has planned a hearing later this month about policing, as a result of Floyd's death.

We must acknowledge that more than six decades after the birth of the civil rights movement, we remain a grossly unequal society in which people of color — especially black men — face disparate treatment because of the pigment of their skin. ADVERTISING Disparate treatment most disturbingly from people in power: From the Minneapolis police officer who held his knee on George Floyd’s neck for about eight minutes as he stopped breathing; the Georgia officials who ignored the fatal shooting of jogger Ahmaud Arbery; and the off-duty police officer who walked into the wrong Dallas apartment and murdered Botham Jean. Those are just some in an endless list of cases that make many African Americans fear the people who are supposed to protect them, worry about walking down the street, agonize about the safety of their children and hesitate at reporting crime. We must speak up against the racism and against the economic injustices that have historically made — and continue today to make — it impossible to truly equalize our society. We must speak up and speak out — but we must do so peacefully. Sadly, that’s not what we’ve witnessed these past two nights. While most seek nonviolent tactics to make themselves heard, once again some are determined to wreak havoc on our cities. The trashing of our communities solves nothing. It only makes the economic injustice worse for it damages the businesses that employ us and serve us all, and it drains the already-scarce public resources needed to help the neediest. The destruction is an indictment of wrong-minded protesters bent on violence and should not be taken as a reflection on those who gathered with legitimate cause. The violence must be stopped. Ripping apart our society is not the solution for fixing it. At the same time, there must be wide room for the peaceful voices of protest to be heard. And it’s incumbent on all of us to listen to those voices. To acknowledge that we remain an economically divided nation — and that it’s only gotten worse in the past four years. ADVERTISING It’s time for us to hear the pain and the feelings of helplessness — surely exacerbated by weeks of quarantine as a pandemic ravages our nation and disproportionately attacks the very same minority communities that also experience the worst discrimination. This is a time for America to search its national soul, to recognize the racism within and to work empathetically to correct it. We’ve ignored it for too long.",0.0

We’re at an important moment for our country, and now is the time for us to choose kindness, tolerance, understanding, empathy … it’s time to love each other. Every life is precious …” Coach Y said in a statement this weekend, “My father was a 30-year veteran of the Chicago police department, and if he were still with us right now, he’d be hurt and outraged by the senseless acts of racial injustice that continue to plague our country. Being black in America is tough. I’ve personally been called more racial slurs than I can count, been pulled over many times because of the color of my skin, and even had my home burned down. The response we are seeing across the nation, to the murder of George Floyd, is decades in the making. Too often, people rush to judge the response, instead of the actions that prompted it. We have allowed too many tragedies to pass in vain. This isn’t an African-American issue. This is a human issue.” ADVERTISING This isn’t to judge the benign response of Coach X, Nick Saban, the white Alabama coach. I’m a white columnist with white family and a white background. Saban’s underlining kum-by-yah message is one I might convey. This is to understand how life experience and personal reflection resonates so much more in the response of Coach Y, Doc Rivers, the Los Angeles Clippers coach. It adds to why the NFL should be ashamed at having only four minority coaches and why colleges can’t be places of higher learning as long as their dismal record of diversity hiring persists. The big issues in sports, you see, are often bigger than sports. They always have been from the time Jackie Robinson broke baseball’s color line in 1947. That remains the biggest sports story ever in America. There is no close second. Grown, mature people in leadership roles have experiences such that their words often matter. They must be backed by action, of course. So knowing Vice President Mike Pence stormed out of an NFL game as players peacefully knelt in social protest three years ago, his words from this weekend ring hollow: “We will always stand for the right of Americans to peacefully protest and let their voices be heard.” Doing the right thing in the moment, when it’s against your side’s beliefs, even in the smallest way, can be difficult. It’s also important. North Carolina Central coach LeVelle Moton, who is black, noted on ESPN how few of the big-name, white college coaches have commented on the recent killings. “It seems as if black lives matter to them whenever they can benefit from it,” he said. Last week, Miami Dolphins coach Brian Flores, who is black, was the first NFL coach or executive to comment on the murders. Flores, as I’ve written, might be the most remarkable story in NFL coaching history. He rose from the Brooklyn projects and, without the credibility of being a pro player, became an NFL head coach. That journey delivered this statement: “I’ve had the privilege of being a part of many different circles that have included some very powerful and influential people of all different races and genders. The events of the last few weeks have brought some of the memories of those conversations back to light. I vividly remember the Colin Kaepernick conversations. ‘Don’t ever disrespect the flag’ was the phrase that I heard over and over again. “This idea that players were kneeling in support of social justice was something some people couldn’t wrap their head around. The outrage that I saw in the media and the anger I felt in some of my own private conversations caused me to sever a few long-standing friendships. “Most recently, I’ve had conversations about incentivizing teams for hiring minorities. Again, there was some outrage in the media and talks that this would cause division among coaches, executives and ownership. I bring these situations up because I haven’t seen the same OUTRAGE from people of influence when the conversation turns to Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and most recently George Floyd. ADVERTISING “Many people who broadcast their opinions on kneeling or on the hiring of minorities don’t seem to have an opinion on the recent murders of these young black men and women. I think many of them QUIETLY say that watching George Floyd plead for help is one of the more horrible things they have seen, but it’s said among themselves where no one can hear. Broadcasting THAT opinion clearly is not important enough … “ That’s the most powerful a message a South Florida coach has ever delivered. And unlike the complex issues confronting America, the words of Flores, Rivers, Morton and selected others in recent days, offer a simple lesson for the sports world: Why black coaches matter.",0.0

ADVERTISING “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” One day after a crackdown on peaceful protesters near the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed a block away from the presidential mansion, facing law enforcement personnel standing behind a black chain-link fence. The fence was put up overnight to block access to Lafayette Park, just across the street from the White House. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the protest lacked the tension of the previous nights’ demonstrations. The crowd Tuesday was peaceful, polite even. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” On Monday, law enforcement officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. On Tuesday, pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. Protests ranged across the U.S., including in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina, and Orlando, Florida, where more than 1,000 people gathered in the afternoon to decry the killings of black people. “This has to change,” said 39-year-old Aisxia Batiste, an out-of-work massage therapist in Orlando. “Something has to give. We’re done. This is the beginning of the end of something. It has to be.” In New York, midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Macy’s flagship store was among those hit when crowds of people smashed windows and looted stores as they swept through the area. A police sergeant was hospitalized after being hit by a car in the Bronx, where people walked Tuesday between ransacked buildings and a burned-out car on the Grand Concourse, a commercial thoroughfare. Police made nearly 700 arrests and Mayor Bill de Blasio extended an 8 p.m. curfew all week. “We’re going to have a tough few days,” he warned, but added: “We’re going to beat it back.” He pleaded with community leaders to step forward and “create peace.” Thousands of protesters marched Tuesday night in a string of demonstrations across Manhattan and Brooklyn after merchants boarded up their businesses, fearing a repeat of the night before. Many people remained on the streets after the curfew hour. Police eventually ordered them to move along and began taking some into custody. More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and quickly spread across the country. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” On Monday, scattered violence flared in multiple protests, including an officer who was shot and gravely wounded outside a Las Vegas hotel and casino, and four officers shot in St. Louis. They were expected to recover. About a dozen other deaths have been reported around the country over the past week. And nearly 8,000 people nationwide have been arrested, according to a count by The Associated Press. Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump’s threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. “Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, both Democrats, said in a statement, referring to Eisenhower’s use of troops to enforce school desegregation in the South. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination. Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed, brushing up against curfews in Washington and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities. Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck for several minutes. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged too. All four have been fired.

The sizable turnout to demonstrations in Hilo on Tuesday and in Kailua-Kona on Sunday, prompted by social media, was for a peaceful protest of the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for almost 9 minutes — and almost 3 minutes after Floyd went unconscious — during an arrest May 25. A woman who identified herself simply as Ilohia said she’s “standing up for humanity and equality for all people.” “Hawaiians fight for land, and (African Americans) are fighting for their lives,” she said. “I’ve never been discriminated against, so I don’t understand what it feels like to have the color of my skin judged. But I stand with them in solidarity.” Malone’s partner, Tiana Malone Jennings, also compared the current protests to issues faced by Native Hawaiians, especially those who have, so far, successfully protested against the building of the Thirty Meter Telescope on Maunakea. “We need to stand right now when black lives matter as we stand when Maunakea matters,” Malone Jennings said. “Everybody stood with us when we were standing up for the mauna. So, of course, we support all of our brothers and sisters of planet Earth. When all life matters, black life matters equally.” Video of the Minneapolis incident taken by an onlooker went viral on social media last week, sparking protests nationwide. While many of those protests were peaceful, others became violent, with buildings burned and businesses looted. Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters in some cities, including Washington, D.C. The cop accused of Floyd’s death, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers, who held bystanders at bay during the incident, also have been fired, but hadn’t been charged with a criminal act as of Tuesday. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said prosecutors are investigating to determine if the other three would also be charged.

The pope is urging the U.S. to reach a national reconciliation, after days of protests and violence. ""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,"" the pope said on Wednesday. He added, ""At the same time, we have to recognize that 'the violence of recent nights is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost.' "" On Wednesday, Francis says, he is joining the faithful in Minneapolis and across the U.S. ""in praying for the repose of the soul of George Floyd and of all those others who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism."" The prayers, he added, would be for consolation for their grieving families, and for reconciliation and peace. In the pope's remarks about violent protests, he was quoting Archbishop José H. Gomez, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who recently issued a statement condemning Floyd's death. In that statement, Gomez asked, ""How is it possible that in America, a black man's life can be taken from him while calls for help are not answered and his killing is recorded as it happens?"" With riots breaking out in many U.S. cities, Gomez cited America's most famous civil rights leader: ""It is true what Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, that riots are the language of the unheard. We should be doing a lot of listening right now."" The pope's message to the U.S. was part of his address during Wednesday's general audience at the Vatican. Here's the full text of that portion of his remarks: ""I greet the English-speaking faithful joining us through the media. ""Dear brothers and sisters in the United States, I have witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest in your nation in these past days, following the tragic death of Mr. George Floyd. ""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life. At the same time, we have to recognize that ""the violence of recent nights is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost,"" ""Today I join the Church in Saint Paul and Minneapolis, and in the entire United States, in praying for the repose of the soul of George Floyd and of all those others who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism. Let us pray for the consolation of their grieving families and friends and let us implore the national reconciliation and peace for which we yearn. May Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mother of America, intercede for all those who work for peace and justice in your land and throughout the world. ""May God bless all of you and your families. """,0.0
