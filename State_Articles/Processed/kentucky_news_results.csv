Andy Beshear's mansion at the state Capitol in Frankfort, Kentucky, Sunday hung an effigy of the governor on a tree outside. The protest was advertised on Facebook as a Patriot Day Rally to exercise Second Amendment rights. As the rally was winding down, someone drove up in a pick up truck and pulled the effigy of Beshear out of a bag and hung it on a tree, Gerry Seavo James told CNN. The effigy had a note around its neck with the Latin phrase ""sic semper tyrannis,"" which roughly translates to ""thus always to tyrants."" Generally attributed to Brutus, the phrase was shouted by the assassin John Wilkes Booth when he shot President Abraham Lincoln and is also the state motto of Virginia James, a freelance journalist, has been attending and documenting Second Amendment rallies over the past month, he said. ""It's a very chilling image to see in modern America. And especially as an African American man,"" James explained. After the effigy was hung from a tree another man came up and cut it down, James said. ""There's a gentleman that came up. He was pretty upset about it, and he cut it down. And he was like this has no place at this rally. We're trying to be peaceful,"" James said. Democrats and Republicans condemned the actions toward the Democratic governor. ""The act that was displayed on Capitol grounds today, near where the Governor and his young children live, was wrong and offensive. This type of behavior must be condemned,"" Crystal Staley, communications director for Beshear, said in an email to CNN Sunday night. ""As Kentuckians we should be able to voice our opinions without turning to hate and threats of violence. Put simply -- we are and should be better than this."" Sen. Mitch McConnell and the state Republican Party also reacted to the news on Twitter Sunday night, denouncing the actions of those involved.

""It could have been both of us,"" Palmer said. ""I would have been in my bed."" Palmer's sister was Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in her southwest Louisville apartment in the early morning hours of March 13. Police had a search warrant for Taylor's apartment, which she shared with Palmer, as part of a narcotics investigation. No drugs were found in the home. Dozens of Taylor's family, friends and community members gathered outside the apartment where she died for a Memorial Day wreath laying.

The green door into apartment No. 4 had been replaced, as had the sliding glass patio door that was once shattered by gunfire. But the bullet hole in the bedroom window was still there, visible in the background throughout the memorial.

The public pressure, she said, is what's helped secure little victories so far, like Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad leaving office and the charges being dismissed against Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. Walker was charged with attempted murder of a police officer the night Taylor died. Walker said he did not know it was police entering the apartment, and fired a shot that injured Sgt.

Taylor, 26, was shot and killed in mid-March as Louisville Metro police officers were attempting to serve a search warrant at her apartment. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, has said he believed the officers to be intruders so he shot at them as they entered the apartment. The officers fired back and Taylor was hit multiple times, according to her family's attorneys. Her mother, Tamika Palmer, and more than a hundred family members, friends and community activists gathered to demand action be taken against the three officers involved.""She mattered and she was somebody, and they treated her like she wasn't,"" Palmer said. Palmer said her family struggled to get answers about what happened to her daughter until the case gained national attention earlier this month. ""It was frustrating. It was lonely. It was miserable.

Andy Beshear from a tree and then marching to the governor’s mansion, chanting “Come out Andy,” according to tweets from a Courier Journal reporter. The governor lives in the mansion with his wife and two children. Reporter Sarah Ladd sent out a string of tweets from the rally late Sunday afternoon, including a photo of the effigy with a noose around its neck. It also had the Latin phrase “Sic semper tyrannis” on the back. The phrase is attributed to Marcus Iunius Brutus, who was one of Julius Caesar’s assassins, roughly translated to “thus always to tyrants.” The saying is also associated with John Wilkes Booth, as some historical accounts say he shouted it after assassinating President Abraham Lincoln. According to a Facebook event, the “Patriot Day 2nd Amendment Rally” was a demonstration in support of gun rights, organized by Ben Kennedy. A spokesperson with Kentucky State Police said they aren’t answering any questions about the incident at this time. Sunday evening, Crystal Staley, the communications director for Beshear’s office, shared the following statement with WFPL: “The act that was displayed on Capitol grounds today, near where the Governor and his young children live, was wrong and offensive. This type of behavior must be condemned. As Kentuckians we should be able to voice our opinions without turning to hate and threats of violence. Put simply – we are and should be better than this.” The State Journal reported that many of the attendees came with firearms and received copies of the Constitution and sheets with the lyrics to “The Star Spangled Banner.” Kentuckians spoke out against the effigy on social media. Some called it a display of White Supremacy, demanding elected officials of all political parties to speak out against it. On Twitter, Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams said the effigy was “disgusting and I condemn it wholeheartedly.” This is disgusting and I condemn it wholeheartedly.

The gathering began as a Second Amendment rally, but morphed into a protest against coronavirus public health measures, NBC affiliate WLEX reported. “Doing this in front of our Capitol, just a short walk from where the Governor, First Lady, and their two young children live, is an act that reeks of hate and intimidation and does nothing but undermine our leading work to battle this deadly disease and restore our economy safely,” the House Democratic leadership said in a statement to WLEX. In a Facebook live video, James said the hanging occurred near the end of the protest, when an organizer told him and a few other reporters that he had something for them to see. “They got to their truck and they pull out this plastic bag,” James said. “It’s governor Beshear.” Beshear has not commented on the protest.",0.0

I recently devoured a few non-fiction books about murder cases taking place in Kentucky, one written by Gary P. West and the other by Peter Brackney. West’s book dealt with one that happened in 1975 near Elizabethtown (commonly called “E-town”). Brackney’s account was one occurring a hundred years ago in the Lexington area. I found each book riveting and, for me, fitting into the “can’t put it down variety.” Both murder cases, of course, were sordid—examples of the very worst in human behavior; likewise in both cases, good people emerged amid tragedy and helpful lessons were learned. West, a Bowling Green resident, is a prolific Kentucky author credited with fifteen published books and writer of many magazine articles. He recently released Murder on Youngers Creek Road (Acclaim Press, 2020). And rather than being “based on a true story,” Gary noted, “this is a true story”… (and) “residents who have lived in and around Elizabethtown, Kentucky, for any length of time still recall it.” The murder of Peggy Rhodes, wife of Paul “Dusty” Rhodes, a prominent E-town car dealer, took place by means of a dynamite explosion on a cold winter night on January 13, 1975, and as the murder investigation developed, facts emerged that the blasting device was initially set on New Year’s Eve, 1974. It also became quite clear that the victim, a 57-year-old woman who was a vital part of community activities and well-respected, was likely not the target. Three Kentucky locales were intricately connected to the case. Besides the crime taking place near E-town, a whole range of criminal activities involving car stealing, gambling, and bootlegging had been occurring south of there in Bowling Green. Jim Johnson, implicated in the murder, had been a sheriff and campaigned for the office of judge in Logan County, though lost. Tragically, Johnson later committed suicide after being investigated in the Rhodes case. As for showing his interest in tackling this book, or any other, Gary is wont to say: “I only take on a project that I will enjoy writing about and I only write about and I only write about something I think people will enjoy reading.” He has a special tie to the Younger Creek book he wrote, as he knew two parties involved, one being the family of the murder-for-hire organizer and the other the family of the victim. Writing about a murder case, however, presented Gary with a steep learning curve. He’d mostly written uplifting stories about noted Kentuckians and Kentucky places, and his work of that kind has always been well-received. This book took over two years to finish and wasn’t easy to do. “In the beginning I wasn’t sure what my biggest challenges would be because I had never done anything like this,” he explained. “Quickly I knew there were key people I needed to talk to if they were still alive. Trial transcripts were very important, but I needed to talk to people… real people.” One of those crucial people interviewed was ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) agent Bob Bridgewater. “He became the ‘John Wayne’ of the story,” Gary said. “He had first-hand knowledge and directed me to other agents who are still alive.” Another big help, Gary noted, was Steve Pitt, the assistant U.S. Attorney who prosecuted the case. Pitt is now general counsel for Kentucky State Attorney General Daniel Cameron. Steve Flairty is a teacher, public speaker and an author of seven books: a biography of Kentucky Afield host Tim Farmer and six in the Kentucky’s Everyday Heroes series, including a kids’ version. Steve’s “Kentucky’s Everyday Heroes #5,” was released in 2019. Steve is a senior correspondent for Kentucky Monthly, a weekly KyForward and NKyTribune columnist and a former member of the Kentucky Humanities Council Speakers Bureau. Contact him at sflairty2001@yahoo.com or visit his Facebook page, “Kentucky in Common: Word Sketches in Tribute.” (Steve’s photo by Connie McDonald) “I chased rabbits for months and months trying to find people,” Gary said. “I found many of them, but a few would not return my call. I kept at it. Some finally did call back.” I asked Gary about what of a positive nature might come in the aftermath of the criminality he wrote about, even though he has encountered some pushback. “I found that in spite of a corrupt and sometimes evil subculture, a community can overcome it,” he said. “That’s not to say that towns like Bowling Green, Elizabethtown and Russellville don’t have major issues… for sure they do. Drugs and even gangs exist. But thankfully, good outnumber’s bad. You don’t have to look only farther than Bardstown to see this.” As I read the book, the image of Jim Johnson intrigued me. He appeared to be a solid citizen. He served honorably in the military, took his family to church, and gained respect from his Logan County community for the job he did as their sheriff. But after losing an election for county judge there, Johnson became part of a car business partnership in E-town that failed, and he became angry with Dusty Rhodes, the original owner. An investigation showed that Johnson might have taken out a contract to have Rhodes killed. As mentioned earlier, Johnson later killed himself. How could something like this—such a dramatic change in life direction–happen to one who appeared to be a model citizen? I asked Gary for his opinion. “Stress causes people to sometimes act out of character, and the financial stress of losing everything with the failed Ford dealership in E-town was more than Jim Johnson could bear,” he said. “Backed in a corner, he thought he had to kill Dusty Rhodes. When that failed, in his mind, he made the ultimate decision… suicide.” I won’t spoil the reading of Murder on Youngers Creek Road by giving any more details, but author Gary West’s foray into a different subject matter such as this has been one done well.

Tensions grew wildly, both because the victim was an innocent child and additionally, the murder suspect, Will Lockett, was black. Brackney, an attorney/author from Nicholasville, has written a well-researched account of the murder and subsequent uprising of an angry crowd bent on lynching Lockett. The story is both chilling and informative of a pivotable time regarding America’s law system and race relations. Called “The Second Battle of Lexington (after the first battle of the Revolutionary War)”, both local authorities and federal troops defended the county courthouse, and eventually martial law was declared. All told, there were casualties (including fatalities) and stirring national publicity, with unfounded rumors and conspiracy theories not uncommon. The book provides a powerful wealth of black/white photos, measured commentary, and adds illuminating facts about a legion of individuals connected to the murder case and mob event taking place a hundred years ago, but the author writes so that the reader feels like it happened only yesterday. And just like in Gary West’s account, in Geneva Hardman there were folks in the community who overcame evil with good actions. Peter talked about that occurrence. “Two heroes really stand out in the Hardman-Lockett story,” he explained. “First there is Geneva’s older brother, Tupper Hardman. His statement on behalf of the Hardman family was printed in the local papers. In it, he called for the law to take its course uninterrupted by those in the commute who sought an immediate lynching of the accused. The second hero who stood out was Governor Edwin P. Morrow. The progressive Republican was incredibly involved in the case. Of course, he sent troops to Lexington and authorized the presence of federal troops. But the governor also went to the state penitentiary where Lockett was being held before his trial, personally meeting with and calming down those who sought to hand Will Lockett.” Unlike Peter’s first book, Lost Lexington, Kentucky, which described, in images and words, old buildings in Lexington, Geneva “tells a single story which required a continuity which was unnecessary in Lost Lexington,” he said. He also noted that the Geneva book “could be revised and expanded… (and) there may be more told about Will Lockett, his attorneys, and his trial. And as for Ms. Belle McCubbing, who was in her yard feeding her chickens and didn’t hear a child struggling on the fateful morning when Geneva was killed… I now have a photograph of her with her chickens.” Peter, like Gary West, was inspired to write his book by a personal connection. The Brackney family attends South Elkhorn Christian Church, close by where the murder occurred. Geneva Hardman and her family also attended there and the sanctuary was the place of her funeral. What’s next for Peter Brackney? “There are so many interesting untold, or incompletely told, stories from our commonwealth’s history and a new history is always being written. As for my next project, a project co-authored with Foster Ockerman, Jr., entitled A History Lover’s Guide to Lexington and the Bluegrass Region will be released this fall. The next project hasn’t yet fallen into my lap… but I’m looking!” Check out more of Peter’s backstories of Kentucky’s unique history on his website and blog The Kaintuckeean – Unique Kentucky History.",0.0

Ah, and asked them to come in and conduct a federal investigation, which they have been on the ground there doing that. And so they will be taking, ah, uh, lead in this investigation. Advertisement President Trump says he asked FBI, Justice Dept. to expedite investigation after man died in police custody Mayor: Officer who put knee on man's neck should be charged Share Shares Copy Link Copy President Donald Trump called for justice Wednesday for the death of George Floyd after a police officer put his knee on the man's neck.It happened after a white police officer was seen on video kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed black man during an arrest, even after the man said he couldn't breathe and stopped moving.""At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd,"" Trump said on Twitter.""I have asked for this investigation to be expedited and greatly appreciate all of the work done by local law enforcement. My heart goes out to George’s family and friends. Justice will be served!""Meanwhile, the mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges to be filed.Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said he believes officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in Monday's death of Floyd. Chauvin and three other officers were fired Tuesday. The video recorded by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes as Floyd is on the ground with his face against the pavement.“I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white.He later added: ""I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.”But despite the officers' swift dismissals, whether the death will be considered a criminal act or something less, like excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate.Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. The Star Tribune reported more conflict Wednesday night at the same precinct, with some protesters throwing rocks and bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. The newspaper also reported looting at a Target store across the street from the station.Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin's suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door.Video: Aerials show protests in Los AngelesMany activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd's family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete.Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests.“We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” Crump said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.”Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department's culture.“One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said.The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons. Video: Protester falls off police vehicle (warning: graphic)Bridgett Floyd told NBC's “Today” show that the officers involved in her brother's death should be charged with murder because “that’s exactly what they did.” She said she had not watched the video, but she told ABC's “Good Morning America” that she does not understand ""how someone could possibly let an individual go out like that.""The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd's death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe.In the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed.The officers in the Minneapolis case have not been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Chauvin. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further.The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned.During Tuesday's protests, some chanted and carried banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” Some stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station.News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record.In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook.Two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long, noting that the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.”“He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.”Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest.The video starts with the man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement.Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.”The man slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics.Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said.At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?”Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant's owner, Jovanni Thunstrom.He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.”___Associated Press writers Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee and Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin, and Hearst TV contributed to this report.",0.0

Andy Beshear was hanged from a tree outside the Kentucky state Capitol during a Memorial Day weekend protest. Louisville Courier Journal White supremacists are openly and notoriously flexing their muscles again with the recent symbolic lynching of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear from a tree at the state Capitol in Frankfort as part of a supposed Second Amendment protest. You might ask how the act of stringing up a white governor relates to white supremacy? Let me explain. Attached to the Beshear dummy was the scrawl, “sic semper tyrannis” (Translation: thus always to tyrants). With that doff of the cap to John Wilkes Booth, who spoke the same words after assassinating the “race-traitor” Abraham Lincoln in 1865, the protesters once again bared their racist fangs. This makes sense for a group of “patriots” who often show up to such rallies with protest signs, guns AND Confederate flags as they “fight against tyranny” across the country. Read this: 'Freedom Rally' protesting Beshear, coronavirus shutdown draws 100+ to the Capitol Saturday More: Beshear hanged in effigy as Second Amendment supporters rally at Capitol before Memorial Day Speaking of lynching, a stone’s throw away in Louisville, a few days earlier, Commonwealth’s Attorney Thomas Wine held one of the strangest press conferences in recent memory in the latest chapter of the Breonna Taylor/Kenneth Walker saga. Wine attempted Jedi (or Sith Lord) mind tricks as he nauseatingly bowed and weaved to justify charging Walker with the attempted murder of a police officer. Then, magically, with neither apology nor explanation, he dismissed the charges with a retreat so deeply buried in rationalizations that it was almost lost. With that, Kenneth Walker avoided another legal lynching suffered by so many black men. Some black folk actually foolishly thanked Wine for dismissing the charges. Such fawning gratitude is misguided for the charges were not dropped because of beneficence or mercy. Indeed, in the aftermath of Breonna Taylor’s killing, the anti-black machinery of control clanked into motion with its familiar playbook on multiple fronts. You know it well. One, believe police, not the injured or dead citizens. Attempted. Two, make every effort to over-charge, over-punish and ruin the black suspect. Done. Three, to support the dominant narrative, have media cast doubt upon and demonize the deceased. Covered. Louisville’s local NBC affiliate, WAVE 3, played that role. Four, disregard, dismiss or threaten black people who push back. Check. Years ago, Louisville Judge Olu Stevens fought valiantly to diversify juries. He was skewered and suspended. In this case, he lowered Kenneth Walker’s bond and granted home incarceration. Stevens was attacked once again. Metro Councilwoman Jessica Green publicly opined that Walker behaved heroically in trying to defend the woman he loved from unknown intruders. She was condemned by the Fraternal Order of Police, called a “cop-killer” and received threats. This time, however, as blacks and their true allies grow increasingly tired of this treatment, Green did not stand alone. Many in the community and a number of Metro Council colleagues rallied to her side. Fifth and finally, if all else fails — recalibrate and wait until next time. In this anomalous round, the normal narrative was disturbed. The standard case protocols, diversions and aspersions that usually justify black death and destruction were simply too weak and wrongheaded to survive once they were dragged into the light of day and people fought back. Be clear, Breonna Taylor’s death would have been ignored or justified and she would have been reduced to yet another hashtag if not for intervention. Kenneth Walker would have been left to rot in jail had their case not gained national traction. Unfortunately, most such situations remain cloaked in darkness with no attention at all. More: Protesters demand Mayor Greg Fischer fire police officers who fatally shot Breonna Taylor Surely, Gov. Andy Beshear is unfazed by his symbolic lynching in the midst of this madness. He appears to be a man with some sense of history. If that is true, he knows there is an American through line leading directly from the country’s founding to the lynch mob outside his door protesting restrictions to deal with a virus that is disproportionately infecting and killing black folk. If Beshear knows his history, he knows he’s in great shape because, unlike so many others, he’s still alive and powerful. His Kentucky constituents symbolically lynched him in the same month Demark Vesey was actually hanged in 1822, the Confederate Congress proclaimed black Union soldiers should be enslaved or executed in 1863, and Ida B. Wells resolved to leave Memphis after rampant lynchings in 1892. May is the month white mobs burned black teenager Jesse Washington alive in 1916, shot Rev. George Lee to death for simply attempting to register to vote in Mississippi in 1955, set fire to a Freedom Riders bus in Anniston, Alabama, in 1961, and “brave first responders” attacked black children with water hoses and dogs in Birmingham in 1963. All things considered, Beshear has it good. He also knows what messages mobs are sending when they hang things from trees. They are parts of longstanding American white supremacist gangsterism cloaked in justice, freedom and opposition to tyranny rhetoric. Beshear knows (or should know) that white supremacy runs much deeper than Confederate flag-waving, gun-toting, effigy-lynching fanatics. It is a system that reifies itself on myriad levels as whites maintain their right to be the only ones to know, think and decide — and that needs to change. Buy Photo Ricky Jones.

Suddenly, some things started to change. Mayor Greg Fischer proposed changes to policies for no knock warrants and body camera usage. The FBI opened an investigation into the incident. Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad announced he would retire. And Commonwealth’s Attorney Tom Wine moved to dismiss charges against Kenneth Walker, Taylor’s boyfriend. Walker was released by a judge on Tuesday. He had been awaiting trial under house arrest. But supporters say those changes aren’t enough. Bianca Austin, Taylor’s aunt, said the goal isn’t getting things to change quickly — it’s getting them to change forever. “We don’t want this to ever happen to anybody else. This is devastating. It’s not right. Nobody should ever have to go through this,” she said after a protest outside Fischer’s office on Tuesday. “We’re in it for the long haul.” Dozens of people gathered on the steps of Metro Hall to demand changes they believe will deliver justice for Taylor, Walker and other victims of police violence. Some asked for a civilian oversight programs, others for an end to no knock warrants, and others for the officers involved in the incident to be fired and charged. Fischer opened the door to a civilian review board last week, and announced the creation of a task force to develop that. Days later, two Metro Council members filed legislation aimed at restricting the use of no-knock warrants and defining how body cameras should be used when executing search warrants. Sgt. John Mattingly, who was shot in the leg by Walker during the raid, and officers Myles Cosgrove and Brett Hankison were placed on administrative reassignment after the incident. Taylor’s family has taken up a civil suit against them alleging excessive force and unlawful death. Velicia Walker, Kenneth’s mother, said she is mourning the trauma her son endured, as well as the loss of Taylor, whom she considered a daughter. “Her engagement ring is in my jewelry box right now,” she said. She said her faith in God fuels her belief that justice will be served. She does not have the same faith in the city. “That didn’t just begin now. This elevated it to a place I can’t even register. I can’t measure it,” she told WFPL. Immediately preceding the protest, Fischer held a virtual town hall discussing the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Louisville’s Black citizens. He said they make up nearly a third of the city’s 154 deaths, despite representing less than a quarter of Louisville’s overall population. Austin said she believed the pandemic gave officials a way to avoid addressing her niece’s death. “I believe they thought that would be an excuse for them to sweep it under the rug and not deal with it. But they came for the wrong family,” she told WFPL. “We’re not tolerating this at all.” She said the next step in her community’s pursuit of justice is getting all possible details about what happened that night and seeing the police officers involved held accountable. After that, she plans to continue pushing for reforms that she and other believe could make Louisville safer for its Black residents. Achieving that will require sustained effort, said Linda Sarsour, co-founder of advocacy group Until Freedom, which helped organize the protest. The group is focused on addressing racial injustice. “You get the justice you fight for,” Sarsour said. She called on justice seekers to remain engaged and continue demanding answers from public officials.",0.0

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Protesters flocked outside Louisville Metro Hall Tuesday demanding Mayor Greg Fischer hold the three officers involved in the fatal of Breonna Taylor accountable. The group wants to see Sgt. Jon Mattingly and Detectives Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove fired and prosecuted. Charges against the boyfriend of Taylor, Kenneth Walker, have been dismissed Tuesday following a motion filed by Commonwealth Attorney Tom Wine. Friday, Wine asked a judge to dismiss the case against Walker. The charges were dismissed without prejudice which means if more evidence comes out of an independent investigation, the charges could be reinstated. ""It’s the right thing to do,"" Kenneth Walker's mother, Velicia Walker said. ""That’s the only thing my son’s been saying is it's not a black or white thing, but it's a right or wrong thing and that’s the way he was raised.” Kenneth Walker was seen outside the courthouse with family and supporters following the protest. ""[Breonna Taylor's] engagement ring is in my jewelry box right now, there are baby shoes that they were preparing to have a life for,"" Velicia Walker said during the protest. ""He lost his love. I don't allow anger to control me because this is God's plan I may not like all of it, but it's his plan and his purpose and the truth will prevail."" Faith leaders, community members and activists from New York City came out to show their support. ""We actually have a one-way ticket and we are going to continue to watch this case,"" co-founder of Until Freedom in New York City, Linda Sarsour said. ""We want to make clear this is not a partisan case, we have democrats here in office that require the same accountability as republicans across the country that also need to engage in accountability and do their job.” “It’s time that we be of integrity and that we be above board because you are not private servants, you are public servants!” president of Louisville's Interdenominational Ministerial Coalition, Dr. Frank Smith said during the protest. Taylor's aunt, Bianca Austin said the former EMT moved to Louisville from Grand Rapids, Michigan in search of better opportunities. ""For her not to even be here, it's devastating,"" Austin said. ""That void will always be there. We’re here for the long haul and if we got to sit out here every day and get our point across that’s what we’re going to do.” Austin expressed gratitude to the dozens of supporters in Louisville and across the country. ""It's just amazing the amount of support we have gotten and we're just overwhelmed with everything that's happening so far,"" Austin said. Mayor Greg Fischer's spokesperson Jean Porter said there is a process they have to follow. In a statement sent to WHAS11 Porter said: ""The three officers involved in the Taylor case are currently on administrative reassignment pending the outcome of the PIU investigation and a decision by the Attorney General as to whether criminal charges are warranted. Once that decision has been made, the LMPD’s Professional Standards Unit will conduct a comprehensive investigation to determine if any of the involved employees violated department policies. Sustained violations of department policy may result in disciplinary actions ranging from counseling to termination. Any sustained discipline involving a suspension or termination is subject to appeal to the Police Merit Board and Jefferson Circuit Court. In the meantime, the officers’ police powers are limited; they have been ordered not to initiate any police action until their police powers have been restored.""",0.0

Andy Beshear was hanged from a tree outside the Kentucky state Capitol during a Memorial Day weekend protest. Louisville Courier Journal Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear on Tuesday addressed a hanging in effigy incident that occurred Sunday, stating he would not leave the governor's mansion despite protestors who chanted ""just a windowpane away from where my kids play."" Increased security measures are being considered, he said. Beshear stated he is leaving any charges that may be filed in connection to the incident to prosecutors and investigators. As he has done at almost every opening, Beshear began Tuesday's conference with the saying, ""We're going to get through this, and we're going to get through this together."" ""Today, maybe I need to say it just as much as you do,"" he said. More: Kentucky first lady thanks supporters who rallied against governor being hanged in effigy The effigy, hung from a tree outside the Kentucky state Capitol during a Memorial Day weekend protest, bore a sign that read, ""sic semper tyrannis,"" which means ""thus always to tyrants,"" the Courier Journal reported.

May 25, 2020 (Photo: Matt Stone/Courier Journal) Those words are believed to have been yelled by John Wilkes Booth after he assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. ""Think about it,"" Beshear said. ""A celebration of assassination on our Capitol grounds."" Beshear said members of the right-wing militia group, the Three Percenters, left the front of the Capitol during the rally and walked through barriers up to the governor's mansion, disregarding signs stating the premises were not open to the public. ""They walked up and stood on the front porch. And there, just a windowpane away from where my kids play, the mob chanted and heckled,"" Beshear said. The Beshears are the first family to live in the governor's mansion in more than 30 years, the governor said. Beshear said he thought his kids might be teased, having their father as governor. He knew their lives would be different. ""One thing I never thought about, and never questioned, was their personal safety,"" Beshear said. ""While I thought that, and I knew that kids from time to time would probably be mean to them, just because of who their dad was, I did not consider that they might be bullied or heckled by grown adults. And then Sunday happened."" Beshear's children, ages 9 and 10, were not at the mansion at the time of the incident, he said. At least 100 people came out for Sunday's rally in Frankfort, which was meant to inspire people ""about what it really means to be FREE,"" according to Take Back Kentucky. Take Back Kentucky issued a statement Monday, saying they were not organizers of the Sunday rally but had shared information on the event. ""We periodically will share information on events that would be of interest to those who care about the Constitution and individual rights. We would not have shared it if we had known of the plan that certain individuals had to finish the rally in this manner. It seems many were caught off guard by the actions of a few,"" the post reads. Crystal Staley, a spokeswoman for Beshear, provided the following statement to the Courier Journal: The act that was displayed on Capitol grounds today, near where the Governor and his young children live, was wrong and offensive. This type of behavior must be condemned. As Kentuckians we should be able to voice our opinions without turning to hate and threats of violence. Put simply — we are and should be better than this. Beshear called upon elected officials who have backed such extremist groups to take responsibility for their part in the effigy. ""You cannot fan the flames and then condemn the fire,"" he said. Such a display, aimed at creating fear and terror, Beshear said, was a move intended to bully the government. Beshear also acknowledged Tuesday that the hanging was intended to send a message of intolerance and hate, condemning the ""painful symbol"" as ""wrong, as vile, and as evil."" ""I will not be afraid. I will not be bullied. And I will not back down,"" the governor said. The effigy incident came one month following another threat against Beshear involving Second Amendment protestors. A mid-April post in the ""Boone County Neighborhood Group"" stated Beshear should be removed from office ""by any means necessary,"" the Courier Journal reported. Protestors against Gov. Andy Beshear' ready an effigy to hang from a tree at the end of the Patriot Day and 2nd Amendment Rally at the Kentucky State Capitol Sunday afternoon.

""Then he denies us of our constitutionally protected right to practice our religion. Now he denies us are constitutionally protected right the peaceful protest. ""By these ... unconstitutional acts on the part of Andy Beshear the Constitution protects us and gives us the authority to eliminate him by any means necessary via the Second Amendment."" Kentucky lawmakers and elected officials condemned the comments. At the time, Beshear said he felt safe and that he ""couldn't be in better hands"" with the help of the Kentucky State Police. Beshear provided the same sentiment Tuesday, stating he takes his role as governor and the responsibility that comes with it seriously. ""I owe it to the people of Kentucky not to bow to terror, but to continue to do what is right for their families and for mine,"" Beshear said. After his speech, Beshear put on his face mask and then paused. He removed the mask for a moment before stepping away and added: ""Do we still think it's too much to wear a mask? To protect our fellow human being? I wear it to protect my family. I think other people should wear it to protect theirs.""

Andy Beshear delivered to lawmakers during his evening coronavirus briefing following a Memorial Day weekend protest where right-wing militia members hung a noose around an effigy of the governor outside his home. Beshear condemned the protesters’ actions as “aimed at creating fear and terror,” and called on Republican elected officials who had previously glad-handed with the group to claim responsibility for encouraging their actions. He contrasted the protesters’ message of hate with symbols of hope; the green glow illuminating front porches, the bells rung in support of health care workers and the messages written in chalk on Kentucky sidewalks. “I owe it to the people of Kentucky not to bow to terror but to continue to do what is right for their families, and for mine,” Beshear said. On Sunday, during the “Patriot Day 2nd Amendment Rally,” a small number of protesters crossed a barrier, chanting and heckling on the front porch of the governor’s mansion – outside a room where Beshear said his 9 and 10-year-old children play. Armed protesters dressed in tactical gear also strung a noose around an effigy of the governor and raised it from a tree branch beside the mansion. Underneath, they had printed the words John Wilkes Booth claimed to yell after shooting President Abraham Lincoln: “Sic semper tyrannis,” Latin for “thus always to tyrants.” That the words echoed through history was not lost on Beshear. “It included the saying yelled by Lincoln’s assassin. Think about it, a celebration of assassination on our Capitol grounds. So let’s start by calling it what it was and what it is, actions aimed at creating fear and terror,” Beshear said. Beshear similarly noted that although it was his white face on the dummy, he believes it also served as a message to black Kentuckians, an audience that “knows the pain from that, much deeper than I ever will,” he said. Beshear’s family is the first to live full time at the governor’s mansion in more than 30 years. The governor said his family made the decision to live there believing it would help to unify the state, but that was before the coronavirus changed the world.

Those officials included Republican State Reps. Savannah Maddox, from Dry Ridge, and Stan Lee from Lexington, according to the Courier Journal. “Standing in front of a radical militia group, these elected officials claim that people including me aren’t Christian and even told them that people wanted babies to be murdered. What do you think was going to happen after throwing out these types of claims to this group?” Beshear said. “You cannot fan the flames and condemn the fire.” Beshear was emotional during the speech, he said as much, and expressed his concern for the well-being of his children.

1617875148,2020-05-27 00:49:54,What we know about the death of George Floyd: 4 Minneapolis police officers fired after 'horrifying' video hits social media,http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/625263896/0/cincinnati-home~What-we-know-about-the-death-of-George-Floyd-Minneapolis-police-officers-fired-after-horrifying-video-hits-social-media/,en,False,,82890,nky.cincinnati.com,http://nky.cincinnati.com/#spider,"Government officials and Minnesota locals alike expressed outrage after a video surfaced showing a white police officer kneeling on the neck of a black man and ignoring his pleas for help until first responders put him, unresponsive, on a stretcher. The man, identified at 46-year-old George Floyd, died at a local hospital, according to police. The case echoes the death of Eric Garner, another black man who died while a white officer restrained him, ignoring pleas of ""I can't breathe."" The four officers involved in the Monday incident were fired Tuesday, and the attorney for Floyd's family, Ben Crump, called for their arrests. The officers have yet to be officially identified, but attorney Tom Kelly told The Associated Press he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd's neck. Kelly declined further comment. Here's what we know so far: What's in the video? A video taken by a bystander circulating on social media shows Chauvin with his knee pressed into Floyd's neck while the man repeatedly says he can't breathe. Floyd repeatedly pleads with Chauvin, at one point crying out for his mother and saying ""everything hurts."" Two officers are featured prominently in the video — Chauvin and an officer who stands between bystanders and the officer on top of Floyd. “He’s talking, he’s fine,” one officer says to a person off-camera. GBI says investigation wrapping up:Man who filmed Ahmaud Arbery shooting arrested “He ain’t fine,” the person replies before calling the officer a “bum” and saying he’s “enjoying what’s happening.” Chauvin keeps his knee pressed into Floyd’s neck and Floyd stops talking. About four minutes into the video, Floyd becomes unresponsive. Bystanders approach Chauvin and the officer draws something, causing one of the people off-camera to say, “He’s got mace.” Bystanders repeatedly ask the officers to check for a pulse. Chauvin doesn’t remove his knee from the man's neck until EMS puts an unresponsive Floyd onto a stretcher, roughly four minutes after he stopped responding. What is a 'neck restraint'? The Minneapolis Police Department's Policy & Procedure Manual defines a neck restraint as a ""non-deadly force option."" The handbook reads: ""Defined as compressing one or both sides of a person’s neck with an arm or leg, without applying direct pressure to the trachea or airway (front of the neck). Only sworn employees who have received training from the MPD Training Unit are authorized to use neck restraints."" The book has two types of neck restraints: Conscious Neck Restraint: The subject is placed in a neck restraint with intent to control, and not to render the subject unconscious, by only applying light to moderate pressure. Unconscious Neck Restraint: The subject is placed in a neck restraint with the intention of rendering the person unconscious by applying adequate pressure. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, speaking to reporters Tuesday, was asked about the use of the knee on Floyd's neck during the arrest. “We clearly have policies in place regarding placing someone under control,” Arradondo said, explaining that those policies “will be part of the full investigation we’ll do internally.” What do police say happened? The Minneapolis Police Department released a statement Monday that said officers responded to a report of a forgery in progress just after 8 p.m. Police discovered a suspect and ordered him to get out of his car. ""After he got out, he physically resisted officers,"" MPD said in a statement. ""Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress. Officers called for an ambulance. He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center by ambulance where he died a short time later."" No weapons were used by anyone in the incident, according to the MDP statement, and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was called to investigate the incident. Calling police:White woman fired after calling police on black man who asked her to leash her dog Police on Tuesday updated the statement to add, ""As additional information has been made available, it has been determined that the Federal Bureau of Investigations will be a part of this investigation."" The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office is assisting with the investigation. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension released a statement saying, ""The names of the officers involved will be released once initial interviews with incident participants and witnesses have taken place."" Who are George Floyd and Derek Chauvin? Floyd, who worked security at Conga Latin Bistro, was described as a ""gentle giant,"" the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported Tuesday. On Facebook, the restaurant posted pictures of Floyd, including one of him smiling at the camera in a ""security"" T-shirt. The caption reads, ""We will always remember you."" Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, whom police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 in a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. What's the response? The four officers involved in the incident were fired, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted Tuesday afternoon. On Facebook, Frey said, ""Being Black in America should not be a death sentence."" ""Whatever the investigation reveals, it does not change the simple truth, he should still be with us this morning,"" the mayor said. ""I believe what I saw and what I saw is wrong on every level."" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz also took to social media to demand answers. Sen. Amy Klobuchar called the video ""horrifying"" and ""gut-wrenching"" and called for an investigation. More:Indiana lawmaker accused of racism for posting meme of black children celebrating 'free money' ""The lack of humanity in this disturbing video is sickening,"" Walz tweeted. ""We will get answers and seek justice."" Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, called for a ""thorough"" FBI investigation. ""George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice,"" Biden tweeted. ""His life mattered. I'm grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved — they must be held responsible for their egregious actions."" Protesters filled the intersection in the street where Floyd died on Tuesday night, chanting and carrying banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” They eventually marched about 21/2 miles to a city police precinct, with some protesters damaging windows, a squad car and spraying graffiti on the building. A line of police in riot gear eventually confronted the protesters, firing tear gas and projectiles. Some protesters kicked canisters back toward police. Some protesters stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station, and though steady rain diminished the crowd, tense skirmishes stretched late into the evening. Crump, who is also part of the team representing the family of Ahmaud Arbery, the black jogger who was shot and killed after allegedly being pursued by a white father and son in Georgia, called the firing of the four officers a good ""first step"" in a statement. On Twitter, Crump called for the four officers to be arrested on murder charges. ""How many 'while black' deaths will it take until the racial profiling and undervaluing of black lives by police finally ends?"" Crump said in a statement. Contributing: The Associated Press.",0.0

Andy Beshear from a tree at the Kentucky state Capitol has been fired from his job at an auto dealership. Terry Bush, president of the Kentucky 3 Percenters group, was fired by Neil Huffman Auto Group on Tuesday, his wife Patsy Bush confirmed Wednesday morning. The auto dealer had announced Tuesday evening that it had terminated an unnamed employee who was involved in the protest Sunday where the effigy was hanged, saying it did not ""condone threats of violence in any form."" Terry Bush has not responded to a request for comment left with his wife. Patsy Bush is the state secretary of the Kentucky 3 Percenters and was also present at the protest in Frankfort. ""He was fired because this governor is more important than the regular Joe out in this state trying to put food on their tables,"" she said Wednesday morning. Beshear on effigy: 'I will not be afraid. I will not be bullied. And I will not back down' She said the effigy wasn't her group's idea and that her husband only helped when it came time to hang it.

However, an account bearing his name has several posts on a group page dedicated to the rally called ""Patriot Day 2nd Amendment Rally.""

There is no place for hate or intolerance at any of our dealerships."" Patsy Bush told The Courier Journal on Wednesday morning that the whole thing isn't right and lashed out at Beshear. ""When is his iron grip on this state going to end, how many more families is he going to devastate before the people realize how poisonous he really is?"" Patsy asked. ""I heard him yesterday, he has no intention of lifting his grip on this state, he absolutely loves the fact that he believes he is so big, listen to the way he states things and tell me he isn’t on some warped trip of power."" In his Wednesday evening press conference, Beshear didn't directly respond to Bush's loss of work or the threats against Bush's family. He did, however, reiterate his Tuesday thoughts. He said that the effigy hanging and the march to the Governor's Mansion ""happened in ways to create and show hate to numerous other people in America. I don't want to claim that I know how that history feels, but I think all of us would say that different decisions have consequences.""

Andy Beshear was hanged from a tree outside the Kentucky state Capitol during a Memorial Day weekend protest. Louisville Courier Journal The protester who hoisted an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear from a tree at the Kentucky state Capitol has been fired from his job at an auto dealership. Terry Bush, president of the Kentucky 3 Percenters group, was fired by Neil Huffman Auto Group on Tuesday, his wife Patsy Bush confirmed Wednesday morning. The auto dealer had announced Tuesday evening that it had terminated an unnamed employee who was involved in the protest Sunday where the effigy was hanged, saying it did not ""condone threats of violence in any form."" Terry Bush has not responded to a request for comment left with his wife. Patsy Bush is the state secretary of the Kentucky 3 Percenters and was also present at the protest in Frankfort. ""He was fired because this governor is more important than the regular Joe out in this state trying to put food on their tables,"" she said Wednesday morning. Beshear on effigy: 'I will not be afraid. I will not be bullied. And I will not back down' She said the effigy wasn't her group's idea and that her husband only helped when it came time to hang it. Ben Kennedy, an organizer of the rally, has not returned phone calls requesting comment, including one made Wednesday. However, an account bearing his name has several posts on a group page dedicated to the rally called ""Patriot Day 2nd Amendment Rally."" In one post, the user says, ""As far as what happened at the rally I take full responsibility for everything."" Beshear addressed the effigy hanging during his Tuesday press conference, calling for unity and criticizing the group of protesters who brought a demand that he resign to the door of the Governor's Mansion. He said they were chanting ""on the other side of the glass from where I raise my kids"" and that it was ""an action intended to use fear to get their way.""

I will not be bullied. And I will not back down,"" Beshear said. Patsy Bush, who says her family has been threatened with violence, contends the firing was unjust. ""Neil Huffman let outside influences cause a man who had never been late, always professional and had been an outstanding employee be fired for no good cause,"" she said.

""The Neil Huffman Auto Group does not condone threats of violence in any form, whether they be a call to action or an implied threat,"" she wrote. ""... There is no place for hate or intolerance at any of our dealerships."" Patsy Bush told The Courier Journal on Wednesday morning that the whole thing isn't right and lashed out at Beshear. ""When is his iron grip on this state going to end, how many more families is he going to devastate before the people realize how poisonous he really is?"" Patsy asked. ""I heard him yesterday, he has no intention of lifting his grip on this state, he absolutely loves the fact that he believes he is so big, listen to the way he states things and tell me he isn’t on some warped trip of power."" In his Wednesday evening press conference, Beshear didn't directly respond to Bush's loss of work or the threats against Bush's family. He did, however, reiterate his Tuesday thoughts. He said that the effigy hanging and the march to the Governor's Mansion ""happened in ways to create and show hate to numerous other people in America. I don't want to claim that I know how that history feels, but I think all of us would say that different decisions have consequences."" ""I would hope that we would all make better decisions like that, as we move forward,"" Beshear said.

Storyful Can a black person breathe in America anymore? Racism won't let us breathe. Police won't let us breathe. COVID-19 won't let us breathe. And too often, sadly, we won't let us breathe either. The past few weeks have delivered one gut-punch headline after another. Black Americans are dying of the coronavirus at higher rates than any other racial group. An 8-year-old black boy is shot and killed in a Cincinnati apartment, adding to the 150-plus shootings in the city since January. Ahmaud Arbery, 25, gets shot to death by two white men as he jogged through his neighborhood outside of Brunswick, Georgia. A white woman calls the police on a black man after he asks her to put her dog on a leash in New York City's Central Park. And George Floyd, 46, dies in the street with a Minneapolis police officer's knee on his neck. Where do you catch a break in this country if you're black? Racism, discrimination, self-hate and America’s unwillingness to see African Americans as three-dimensional human beings results in a daily nightmare of oppression, health ills and pain and fear that simply can’t go on. We need to breathe. ""I can't breathe."" Hundreds of protesters gather near the site of the arrest of George Floyd, who died in police custody Monday night. (Photo: Jim Mone, AP) Floyd joins an ever-growing list of African Americans killed in police-involved incidents. Floyd's pleas of ""I can't breathe"" fell on deaf, uncaring ears as an officer choked the life out of him for nine minutes while three other officers stood by watching. There's no defending what those officers did in that video, though some will try. Six years after, Eric Garner first uttered those fateful words, ""I can't breathe,"" African Americans are still choking on injustice. This brand of police brutality is why former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt in protest during the national anthem in 2016. His stance for justice got him blackballed from the league. If Kaepernick can't get a job for taking a knee to bring attention to police brutality and save lives, then these four officers sure as hell don't deserve to keep theirs for using a knee to take one. Firing these officers is one thing. Successfully prosecuting them is another. Black people have seen this movie before, and it rarely has a happy ending. Maybe this time, the outcome will be different – just. Many of us won't hold our breath. ""I can't breathe."" CLOSE USA TODAY spoke with legal experts who analyzed video of Ahmaud Arbery's fatal shooting to see what the it could mean for the Georgia case. USA TODAY If you're not incensed by the cold-blooded killings of Floyd and Arbery, I would ask, what is wrong with you? Where is your sense of empathy, of humanity, of justice? We should all be outraged by these senseless deaths. But anger alone isn't enough; we've got to act. Now is the time when people of goodwill – black, brown and white – must come off the sidelines and speak out against the violence. It's time to get involved in our neighborhoods, governments and police departments. It's time to mentor, protest, vote, write our council members, county commissioners and congress members, support civil rights groups, volunteer at schools or community centers, among other activities. We have to take an attitude of if we aren't part of the solution, then we are part of the problem. If we're not insisting on more accountability and better use of force practices from our police departments, then we're part of the problem. If we're not demanding that we stop killing one another in our communities, then we are part of the problem. If we're not stepping up and calling out racism when we see or hear it, then we are part of the problem. If we are not taking steps to protect our health and the health of others in this season of COVID-19, then we are part of the problem. The time for silence, inaction and division has passed. We have a responsibility to one another to aggressively pursue justice and fairness for all people. ""I can't breathe."" People gather at a police precinct during a protest for George Floyd. (Photo: Richard Tsong-Taatarii, Star Tribune via AP) More: Minnesota killing conjures memories of Samuel DuBose death in Cincinnati This is not an attack on all police officers. I'm not anti-police. I'm anti-bad police. And if you're not anti-bad police too, the problem is not me; the problem is you. The truth is, we need those good cops to have the courage to stand up and call out the bad ones – to knock down the blue wall of silence. One bad cop's actions makes it tougher on the good officers who are dutifully trying to protect and serve. So let's not fall for the red herring that this is about all officers. The bad ones use that narrative for cover and we've got to stop providing it. This also is not an attack on all white people. African Americans have allies across all races and ethnicities who are passionate about these issues too. But we need more. We need you to share our stories - post them on your social media. Don't just share them; add your own comments about how you feel. Use your influence to get others in your circle off the sidelines. Black lives matter as much as any other. And we all should be concerned, whether they are taken by a corrupt cop, a contagious virus or another black person. We can put an end to these senseless killings if we can come together in the name of justice. Maybe then we can all breathe. Opinion and Engagement Editor Kevin S.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone) PHOTO:AP Photo/Jim Mone Four Minneapolis Officers Fired After Man's Death By The Associated Press MINNEAPOLIS - To the general public, the video of a white police officer pressing his knee into the neck of a shirtless black man prone on the street, crying out for help until he finally stopped moving, was horrifying. Four officers were fired a day after George Floyd's death, a stunning and swift move by the Minneapolis chief with the mayor's full backing. But despite their dismissal, whether the incident will be considered criminal, or even excessive force, is a more complicated question that will likely take months to investigate. The officers were dismissed soon after a bystander’s video taken outside a south Minneapolis grocery store Monday night showed an officer kneeling on the handcuffed man’s neck, even after he pleaded that he could not breathe and stopped moving. Mayor Jacob Frey announced the firings on Twitter, saying: ""This is the right call.” The FBI and state law enforcement were investigating Floyd's death, which immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. But in the Garner case, local prosecutors, the NYPD’s internal affairs unit, and the Justice Department all finished investigations into the case before the officer was ultimately fired. Garner’s family and activists spent years begging for the officer to be removed. The officers in the Minneapolis incident haven’t even been publicly identified, though one defense attorney has confirmed he is representing Derek Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd’s neck. The attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment further. The police union asked the public to wait for the investigation to take its course and not to “rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers.” Messages left with the union after the firings were not returned. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the department would conduct a full internal investigation, and prosecutors will decide whether to file criminal charges against the officers involved. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office said it was “shocked and saddened” by the video and pledged to handle the case fairly. Part of that investigation will likely focus on the intent of the officers, whether they meant to harm Floyd or whether it was a death that happened in the course of police work. The FBI was investigating whether the officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights. News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, whom police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 in a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record. In Minneapolis, kneeling on a suspect’s neck is allowed under the department’s use-of-force policy for officers who have received training in how to compress a neck without applying direct pressure to the airway. It is considered a “non-deadly force option,” according to the department’s policy handbook. A chokehold is considered a deadly force option and involves someone obstructing the airway. According to the department’s use-of-force policy, officers are to use only an amount of force necessary that would be objectively reasonable. But two use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that the officer clearly restrained the man too long. They noted the man was under control and no longer fighting. Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who now testifies as an expert witness in use-of-force cases, called Floyd’s death “a combination of not being trained properly or disregarding their training.” “He couldn’t move. He was telling them he couldn’t breathe, and they ignored him,” Scott said. “I can’t even describe it. It was difficult to watch.” In a post on his Facebook page, the mayor, who is white, apologized Tuesday to the black community for the officer’s treatment of Floyd, 46, who worked security at a restaurant. “Being Black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a Black man’s neck. Five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you’re supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense,” Frey posted. Police said the man matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store, and that he resisted arrest. The video starts with the shirtless man on the ground, and does not show what happened in the moments prior. The unidentified officer is kneeling on his neck, ignoring his pleas. “Please, please, please, I can’t breathe. Please, man,” said Floyd, who has his face against the pavement. Even in the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 100,000 people in the U.S. and prompted police departments around the country to change how they’re doing work, the officers in the video aren’t wearing masks. In some cities, low-level arrests such as attempted forgery are skipped right now. Floyd also moans. One of the officers tells him to “relax.” Floyd calls for his mother and says: “My stomach hurts, my neck hurts, everything hurts ... I can’t breathe.” As bystanders shout their concern, one officer says, “He’s talking, so he’s breathing.” But Floyd slowly becomes motionless under the officer’s restraint. The officer does not remove his knee until the man is loaded onto a gurney by paramedics. Several witnesses had gathered on a nearby sidewalk, some recording the scene on their phones. The bystanders become increasingly agitated. One man yells repeatedly. “He’s not responsive right now!” Two witnesses, including one woman who said she was a Minneapolis firefighter, yell at the officers to check the man’s pulse. “Check his pulse right now and tell me what it is!” she said. At one point, an officer says: “Don’t do drugs, guys.” And one man yells, “Don’t do drugs, bro? What is that? What do you think this is?” The Hennepin County medical examiner identified Floyd but said the cause of death was pending. Floyd had worked security for five years at a restaurant called Conga Latin Bistro and rented a home from the restaurant owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. He was “a good friend, person and a good tenant,” the restaurateur told the Star Tribune. “He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him.” Protesters filled the intersection Tuesday evening in the street where Floyd died, chanting and carrying banners that read, “I can’t breathe” and “Jail killer KKKops.” They eventually marched about 2 1/2 miles to a city police precinct, with some protesters damaging windows, a squad car and spraying graffiti on the building. A line of police in riot gear eventually confronted the protesters, firing tear gas and projectiles. Some protesters kicked canisters back toward police. Some protesters stacked shopping carts to make a barricade at a Target store across the street from the station, and though steady rain diminished the crowd, tense skirmishes stretched late into the evening. Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights and personal injury attorney, said he had been hired by Floyd’s family. The death came amid outrage over the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was fatally shot Feb. 23 in Georgia after a white father and son pursued the 25-year-old black man they had spotted running in their subdivision. More than two months passed before charges were brought. Crump also represents Arbery's father.",0.0

Like any politician, humans aren't the only ones in the middle of an election cycle. One small town in Vermont appoints a mayor of the four legged variety. Meet Lincoln, a Nubian goat and the first pet mayor of Fair Haven, Vermont, elected to office in 2019. Her campaign caused quite the international stir. I got a phone call from Paris. They wanted to know what was going on. And then this year we made the A rumor times in 2019 the first round of the Pet Mayor race. Just because I think it was the first time this was happening. Word spread, especially in France. They were very interested to know what was happening. What's going on? Why's there go being the mayor? Liz Strep, a a reporter for New Station My NBC five covered the goat mayors rise to political fame and her 2020 bid for re election. But don't worry, Fairhaven isn't actually taking executive orders from a goat. The idea electing an animal mayor really started because the school needed a new playground, their playgrounds. I think 30 years old, it's just really not safe. This slide has a big hole in it, and it's just going down. So as a fund raiser, Teoh get a new playground. They thought of this idea. You know, why don't you let a pet mayor and that will spark donations? That's really their only platform, that these candidates are running forest to raise money. So these animals really aren't making any major decisions in the town. They're really more of a mascot to encourage people to donate money to those students. A new playground Last year's election was pretty small. There were, I believe, three candidates. Lincoln ended up winning. She was a young, spunky little goat, very friendly. So I think that really helped her win that election. Lincoln's first days Mayer was very official, though politicians on four legs do come with their challenges. Last year, Lincoln was attending her swearing in ceremony. She had a little bit of an accident. She lost some for marbles. I guess you could say over things a little bit of a commotion there, but it was very entertained. She made her mark. You could say that wasn't one of her final. She, I guess, had a pretty successful first term, which is why she was seeking re election this year. The pet election turned out to be a huge hit both in and out of Fairhaven. So when the 2020 cycle began, competition was fierce because last year was such a big success. And there was so much publicity about Lincoln becoming the town's first pet mayor. A lot of students in the Fairhaven grade school wanted to nominate their own pets, so we had a bunny, a hamster old horse. I think there were five or six dogs. Five acts. There were 18 candidates. There were three main candidates that stood out to voters. Lincoln, the incumbent goat, Sammy, the police canine. And Murphy, the therapy dog. Lincoln at a very successful first term as mayor being an incumbent. A lot of people knew her name already that she was definitely a front runner. She raised. I think, about 1000 or so dollars for the playground, but the goal is $80,000. They really need to raise a lot more money. Murphy thinks reading is important for kids. He thinks having a safe place to play and be outside and get off their phones. This has important. Murphy, a therapy dog, volunteers at the Bear Even grade school, so students were already very familiar with Murphy and Spur. These owner also had several fund raisers during his campaign, though he raised about $500 before the actual town meeting day vote for the school's playground. We were amazed that we were able to raise that much. And then there, Sammy, but police canine Sammy was actually a rescue dog. All the kids were very from there with her, and they're always I wanted her to come in and pay a visit. Do you get to vote today? Welcome to the election stuff Surveying the voters at the polls. A lot of them were very interested in what the name of the animal waas, but also how cute they were. Why do you want to be the war? Said She's so you want 4 to 9 semi because he's true. Why did you want pizzazz? He's cute, and she likes the log on leashes out polling place on town meeting day. A few of the candidates were outside kind of doing a meet and greet with the kids, though I think that could have swayed some of the undecided voters if they had a good experience. He's feeling great. You got to greet all the kids coming to vote. So it was his day. Well, I think she's hungry. That's about yet She's been nibbling on the building. It's a different sort of a day for Everybody Loves Dogs. And then there's even a greater population of love. Police K Nights, Theo Day after a town meeting day, I was in the classroom with a bunch of eighth graders who are counting ballots, and we were there as the results came in. I won't Lincoln doing because I wanted Lincoln personally because he leaves a lot of money for the playground. Last year, I will say this. Eighth grade class WAAS Chris Stan's Class Kristan is Lincoln's owner, so they were a little biased. They really, really were pretty for Lincoln to win. It's my pleasure to announce the winner of the mayoral race fair in Vermont this year. There are a winner is Murphy the dog with 146 votes. When it was announced over the speaker that Murphy had one, there was a little bit of the side. They were a little disappointed, but it didn't take long for them to start cheering and applauding for Murphy. They were very excited that passing the torch on and it's a new year. I think they're looking forward to seeing what Murphy will do with his mayoral seat. I think Murphy will do a great job with the playground fun, so I really wanted him from that store sampling to win. Yeah, I asked him. He didn't care, but he's a new playground and an excuse to see adorable animals weren't the only benefits to the 2020 pet election. The kids were able to learn valuable lessons about exercising their voting rights. Your vote is your voice in the Democratic process. You have a lifetime of voting ahead of you, and I have to take that chance. Every opportunity you get. At the end of the day, this whole pet mayor raises to raise money for the playground, but also to really introduce kids to the importance of voting and taking election seriously, getting to the voting booth and making your voice heard. That's a right that we all have. You know, where U. S citizens and starting that process really early and getting Kate's excited about this process. That's really built goal of all of this. It doesn't matter who wins the playground, the kids, that's what it's about. They haven't reached their goal yet for the playground, but they're really helping that. Murphy can pulls through and get a lot of donations during his time as mayor. And, of course, we had to know. Will this small Vermont town ever hand over the mayoral office to a human? I don't think that there haven will have a human mayor anytime soon. Because Fairhaven has a human town manager, which is essentially sort of the same thing as a mayor. He makes a lot of the big decisions. He oversees that select board. So I think the town government is free, comfortable with just having a town manager. But I think they also really love having a pet mayor. If you'd like to donate to the Fairhaven Grade School Playground Fund, check out the link to the go Fund me in the description box.

Several lawmakers condemned the act, including U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). .@SenateMajLdr: “As a strong defender of the First Amendment, I believe Americans have the right to peacefully protest.

Neil Huffman Auto Group said it terminated the unidentified employee after an internal review, saying it “does not condone threats of violence in any form."" “There is no place for hate or intolerance at any of our dealerships,"" Shannon Huffman, the auto dealer's human resources manager, said on social media Tuesday evening. Gov. Andy Beshear responded to a question Wednesday about the firing, saying “different decisions have consequences and I would hope that we would all make better decisions.” “But you don’t simply in the moment make a dummy with somebody’s face on it and hang it up,” the Democratic governor said. “I think what we saw was an act intended to create fear and terror.” The protester fired was identified by the Courier Journal as Terry Bush, president of the Kentucky 3 Percenters group. His dismissal was confirmed by his wife, Patsy Bush, the newspaper reported. “He was fired because this governor is more important than the regular Joe out in this state trying to put food on their tables,” Patsy Bush told the newspaper Wednesday. The effigy was hanged in a tree near the State Capitol during what was billed as a protest rally in defense of constitutional rights, including the right to bear arms. The rally turned into a protest against coronavirus restrictions and Beshear’s administration, according to news reports, with protesters chanting outside the Governor’s Mansion for him to come outside. The playing of Lee Greenwood's song “God Bless The USA” at the protest angered the singer. “I am furious that they used my song in an attempt to give strength to their event, and do not condone their behavior and its use in conjunction with a suggested lynching, even one that is purely symbolic,” Greenwood said in a statement. “To be clear, I absolutely support the right for citizens to unite in protest and public gathering. However, my song was written solely to inspire and unite, not further divide and distance our country, certainly as in times of strife as we are today.” ——— Follow AP coverage of the pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",0.0

It then turned into a protest of Gov. Andy, who they say has stepped on their right to get sick and sicken others. In a grand, graphic crescendo that expressed what they want to happen next, they hanged an effigy of the governor outside of the Governor’s Mansion, you know, where he lives with his wife and children. Written on the effigy was: “sic semper tyrannis,” or “thus always to tyrants.” This is what John Wilkes Booth is said to have yelled after shooting President Lincoln. The Kentucky 3Percenters Inc. state secretary told The Courier Journal she was against the hanging because it looked bad (guffaw). “However, we’re at the point where rallies and shouting and hollering is just not working anymore,” she said. Thorn: the Kentucky state not police What were the Kentucky State Police doing during all of this effigy hanging, which also included an attempt to hand-deliver a resignation demand to Beshear’s door, The CJ reported. “A few Kentucky State Troopers got out of their cars to observe but did not attempt to stop the crowd,” the paper wrote. The KSP was asked by The CJ if it was conducting an investigation into the events but was told only that it does “not comment on the level of security provided to protect the governor, nor any inquiries that we receive regarding these efforts.” Advertisement Thorn: Not so grand jury The fatal shooting by police of Breonna Taylor made horribly public the kind of cowboy mentality that we know pervades the police force. If no one had been killed or shot, we likely would not know what happened that morning. You can be sure there are similar cases. On the other end of the (in)justice system, the dismissal of charges against her boyfriend calls into question how the grand jury operates. How many others are indicted without consideration of the evidence? Rose: When you are wrong, you are… Is he a hero or a victim? We say he is both and not a criminal. A charge of attempted murder of a police officer was dismissed for Kenneth Walker. Metro Councilwoman Jessica Green has called him a hero for trying to protect himself and Taylor during that questionable raid that netted neither drugs nor a suspect. The police union head demanded Green retract her statement. We can understand why he would want to stand up for his fraternal disorder of police, but now we think he owes Green an apology.",0.0

Beshear was not surprised when a mob stormed his home,https://www.leoweekly.com/2020/05/lynch-mob-weve-created-gov-beshear-not-surprised-mob-stormed-home/,en,False,,114483,leoweekly.com,http://leoweekly.com/,"Armed protesters marched on Gov. Andy Beshear’s home Sunday and hanged him in effigy, using the words of President Lincoln’s assassin, all because he wants people to wear masks so they don’t join the 100,000 dead from COVID-19. Did he deserve that? Did Breonna Taylor deserve to be shot to death by police in her home because they thought a suspected drug dealer had delivered a package to her house (no drugs were found)? The answer to both, obviously, is: No. We can ask the same questions about George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Christian Cooper. Did any of these people deserve being killed or threatened? Of course not. So, who is responsible for making these people feel so entitled, emboldened and justified that they can kill and threaten innocent Black men and also march on the Governor’s Mansion with no recourse? Why, we all are. Either directly or by being complicit. Either by standing to the side silently while this shit happens or by electing the same people who say “I think there is blame on both sides,” who declined to condemn such ignominy, who refuse to fire police chiefs and officers and those who participate in rallies with armed, white supremacist militias. Those to blame include Donald Trump, who infamously told a New York crowd in 2017 that is was OK to injure suspects during arrests. “When you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over?” Trump said. “Like, don’t hit their head, and they just killed somebody — don’t hit their head. I said, you can take the hand away, OK?” Kentucky’s senior senator, Mitch McConnell, who enables Trump and could not find enough backbone to rebuke him for saying there were “were very fine people on both sides” and “I think there is blame on both sides,” after the Charlottesville “white power,” anti-Semitic rally. And Mayor Greg Fischer, who allowed the chief of police to run a chaotic, dangerous department for years, fraught with child sex scandal, overtime abuses, a huge lawsuit settlement with no consequence for officers, a record homicide rate and now the death of Breonna Taylor. There are more, many more like them who felt it was just fine to fire up gun-toting protesters outside of the Governor’s Mansion, where the governor lives with his wife and two children. On Tuesday, the always measured, moderate and modest Beshear declined to call out those elected officials he thinks emboldened and provoked the armed men who had hanged him in effigy and marched to his doorstep to deliver a demand that he resign. We will: State Rep. Savannah Maddox, the Dry Ridge Republican who posed at a May 2 rally in Frankfort with an armed woman and then denied she knew the woman’s hand sign signaled “white pride.” State Rep. Stan Lee, the porn-stached Republican (who shares a name unfortunately with Spider-Man’s late progenitor). He was at that rally, too, when he decried the overtly religious and spiritual Beshear as a “hypocrite” for allowing an abortion clinic but not churches to remain open. Advertisement On Saturday, a day before the practice lynching of Beshear, the “Freedom Rally” converged on Frankfort to protest his efforts to slow the virus’ spread. Those who spoke at the rally included Jim Waters, CEO of Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, who wrote in the Courier Journal “Was Jesus a ‘Super Socialist’ Would he favor a destructive ideology?” And Wesley Morgan, who lost his seat in the state House in a Republican primary and said he would vote for the Democrat in that race because “tonight, the GOP lost a true conservative and patriot.” “I believe this entire pandemic was orchestrated to destroy President Trump’s economy and to keep people from voting these political tyrants out of office,” Morgan told the crowd, The CJ reported. “I believe it’s all about the election.” That brings us the next day, Sunday, when the Patriot Day 2nd Amendment Rally crescendoed with what some will call an exercise of the First Amendment but others will see as wanton and naked threats of violence. Here is how Beshear said he saw it. “I’ve written down some of my thoughts, how I feel,” he said Tuesday during his daily briefing. “I have tried to be vulnerable and direct in these press conferences, so I want to make sure I was today as well,” he said, explaining why he moved to the Governor’s Mansion. “We have become the first family to live in the Governor’s Mansion full time in over 30 years.” He thought having Kentucky’s first family there would unify Kentuckians. “One thing I never thought about, never questioned, was their personal safety,” he said. “I did not consider they would be bullied or heckled by grown adults.” “And then Sunday happened.” The Three Percenters walked through the barriesr that separated them from the Governor’s Mansion. “They walked up and stood on the front porch, just a windowpane away from where my kids play. The mob chanted and heckled. Thankfully, my kids weren’t there that day. I want to remind you they are 9 and 10 years old.” “Unsatisfied, the mob retreated to an area several hundred yards away and hung a dummy with my face on it. It included the saying used by Lincoln’s assassin. Think about it — a celebration of assassination on our capital grounds. “So, let’s start by calling it what it was, and what it is — actions aimed at creating fear and terror. Crossing over barriers, standing on the other side of the glass from where I raise my kids and hanging me in effigy? That’s an action intended to use fear to get their way. This small group, way less than 3%, is trying to bully everyone else into doing what they want us to do. But, they didn’t get there alone. “They had been embraced and emboldened by elected leaders that rallied with them weeks before. Standing in front of a radical militia group, these elected officials claimed that people, including me, aren’t Christian, and even told them that people wanted babies to be murdered. “What do you think was going to happen after throwing out those type of claims to this group? Shouldn’t they have known what was going to happen? You cannot fan the flames and then condemn the fire. Those elected officials that embraced these individuals, and that stood in front of people dressed in tactical gear and the rest and threw as much red meat as possible at them, they have to claim responsibility because they absolutely know what could have happened. And, they are, in part, responsible for what did happen. “All elected officials can no longer actively seek the support and cater to these groups like we have seen. Right is right and wrong is wrong. You can’t wait until something nasty and horrible happens to then claim it’s wrong, while you’ve then catered to the support of certain groups, for votes or other reasons.” Beshear said he will not be “bullied.” “My faith, the same faith that some of those elected officials and that mob attacked — it tells me that doing the right thing is supposed to be hard,” he said. “I can’t act like those who try to take me off course, and those who try to bully all of our families. I will not be afraid. I will continue to do the right thing, and we will get through this together.” It is important to remember, only 100 or so people attended each of those rallies. Yet, out of all governors, Beshear has received the highest approval rating (81%) next to Ohio’s governor (83%) for their handling of the epidemic. Because he deserves it.",0.0

USA TODAY Sports' Nancy Armour reiterates Kaepernick's protest was never the issue in this country. USA TODAY It has happened again. We’ve seen the life ripped from a helpless black man before our eyes. Yes, we’ve seen it before and now we’ve seen it again. After his death, Minneapolis Police released a statement saying George Floyd “physically resisted officers.” We’ve heard that canard countless times, but we saw him restrained, compliant and prostrate. They say officers “noted (Floyd) appeared to be suffering medical distress” after he was handcuffed, but we saw an agent of the state causing the distress and crushing the life out of the man as he cried and begged for relief. Authorities say we need to wait for a complete investigation, but we saw another unarmed man taken out of this world before our eyes. No investigation will change that. We saw it all. Yes, we saw George Floyd, somebody’s brother, somebody’s father, somebody’s friend, somebody’s child ... coldly and callously exterminated for no reason. 'Stop killing black people': George Floyd's death sparks protests in Minneapolis, Memphis, LA The butchering of black people in America is not new. It is old, all too frequent and baked into the country’s cultural cake. In fact, it is so ingrained and noxious that, outside of the necessity of the survival of the race, the decision to bring black children into such a world could be considered an act of madness. Why would a sane person ever choose to subject another black human being to the consistent stress, strain and even threat of death that comes with being black in America? As we walk through history, there is a long and painful list of black people, some celebrated posthumously and others nameless, who have lost their lives attempting to create a more humane world into which our children could enter with some modicum of decency and safety. Gabriel Prosser, David Walker, Nat Turner, Mary Turner, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr. The list goes on and on. Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and now George Floyd are the most recent additions to the tally of black people having their lives needlessly snuffed out by self- or legally-appointed dealers of “justice” in America. They are the latest examples of black death turned into spectacle or hashtags that will be forgotten within months. Read this: What to know about the investigations into the police shooting of Breonna Taylor We often reduce them to cause celebs that highlight black suffering as we continue treading this long, miserable, stony road seeking equality. In doing so, it is easy to sometimes forget every last one of these people was somebody’s child. CLOSE The FBI is investigating the death of George Floyd after he was restrained by police in Minneapolis. Storyful I am still haunted by footage of Martin King Sr.’s uncontrollable, banshee-like wail as he collapsed into a heap at the sight of his lifeless, casket-bound son. To us, MLK Jr. was a champion, a righteous proselytizer, a tribune, and upon his death — a martyr and symbol. For Daddy and Alberta King, however, he was their child. The Kings were tasked with doing what no parents should do — bury their baby. It is a fundamentally wrong and unnatural act. Children should lay their parents to rest, not vice-versa. This is the pain currently experienced by the families of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and so many other black children we will never hear of, because the national spotlight will not shine on them. Indeed, there seems to be no safe retreat for black people. We literally cannot learn, drive, work, worship, exercise or even sleep in peace. It is a harrowing, all-consuming existence. Buy Photo Ricky Jones. March 14, 2019 (Photo: Scott Utterback/Courier Journal) Black people work feverishly to carve out just a little space to, if not thrive, at least survive. This is at the heart of the inevitable talk black parents, no matter their class, have with their children about interactions with police. In our world, we know our babies may not survive such encounters no matter how minor their transgressions — IF they’ve done anything wrong at all. More: Man who filmed Ahmaud Arbery shooting arrested; GBI says investigation wrapping up There is much and more that troubles black parents, who have neither comfort nor peace as we fearfully walk our children through this menacing gauntlet hoping to keep them alive and sane. In 1961, James Baldwin lamented, “To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time.” I would modify that statement, “To be a black parent in this country and relatively conscious of what can happen to your child because of his or her race is to be in a state of worry almost all the time.” Whether they be 2 or 26 like Breonna Taylor, 4 or 46 like George Floyd, 5 or 25 like Ahmaud Arbery, our children deserve better. Burying them is becoming unbearable. Ricky L. Jones is a professor and political philosopher with degrees from Morehouse College and the University of Kentucky.

1619239632,2020-05-27 15:01:23,Coronavirus Separated Teachers and Students. But Those Bonds Remain Intact.,https://www.louisville.com/content/coronavirus-separated-teachers-and-students-those-bonds-remain-intact,en,False,,96958,louisville.com,http://www.louisville.com/#spider,"Photo by Mickie Winters Though I give my first-grader the news in measured spoonfuls, she knows the rules — the rigid, isolating social contract of 2020. Cheek-to-cheek buddy hugs and playdates travel in the rearview, the memory of her January birthday party at a steamy and cramped trampoline park now feels like a dispatch from a rogue, lawless time. She spots offenders quickly. “Mom, they’re not family and they’re in a crowd,” she says, eyeing a loose but thick group down the street. We are on a sidewalk in the Highlands in late March awaiting a “wave parade,” a sweet, surreal slice of pandemic adopted by schools and families with a birthday to celebrate. Wave, cheer and connect — all from a safe distance, just in case. Along the street, Bloom Elementary students and parents stand with a semitruck-sized space between each cluster. When I told Maria, who is a student at Bloom, about the parade the night before, I assumed she’d be disappointed. A drive-by hello? Friend sightings treated as intimately as a mirage? But her excitement exploded. It’s estimated that nine out of 10 children are out of school this spring throughout the world, splintered from their classroom, their teachers, the routine that shapes most childhoods. We hear staccato car horns first. Bloom’s principal, Jack Jacobs, rounds the corner in his red Jeep, a stuffed version of Bloom’s bulldog mascot in the front seat. (Later, he’ll tell me that it’s a debate about who benefited from the event more — teachers or students.) Maria’s arm flaps hellos as she dutifully performs roll call for her younger brother: That’s the art teacher. She’s in the lunchroom... Some kids race through alleyways to catch a second glimpse of Bloom staff one street over. Maria’s teacher, Ms. Todd (aka Jennifer Todd to the non-child sect), slowly rolls up, a sign dangling from her car: We Love You and Miss You! Maria leaps in place at least a half-dozen times, her smile shifting to nervous, happy laughter, revealing two adult front teeth that have rearranged the landscape of her young face. At seven years old, she’ll remember all of this, I think. I begin to cry. Jacobs will see other parents wipe tears along the parade route. It must be the uncertainty. Maybe anxiety. Or plain loss and sadness. All of it scrambles, and it’s near impossible to simply enjoy the joy of Maria bobbing beside me. On this day, the school closure is still temporary. It’s possible kids and teachers will reunite before the end of the year. “What if people don’t get better?” Maria will ask in the hours after the parade. “What if the virus doesn’t go away? I’ll have to stay home for four weeks, then five weeks, then six.” On Friday, March 13, the day school officially halted due to COVID-19, Jennifer Todd arrived at school feeling anxious. “Sort of like when you know a storm is coming,” she recalls. In her 13 years of teaching, she has never had kids carefully peel drawings from desks and cubbies, grab water bottles and workbooks and head home for who-knows-how-long. “One of the kids asked me, ‘Is this our last day of school?’ She was very astute in asking,” Todd says, remembering the conversation at the end of the lunch line. “I told her, ‘I don’t know. But we’ll see.’” A friend of mine took a picture of her daughter the morning of March 13, figuring it may be her daughter’s final day in first grade. The thought hadn’t even crossed my mind. Todd also hoped for an eventual return. A school year’s final few weeks bring the stuff teachers live for. “In first grade, kids make huge strides in reading,” Todd explains. “Looking at where they came in at in kindergarten and then at the end of the first-grade year, it’s so rewarding.” She witnesses kids settle into nine and a half months’ worth of information, like how to greet each other and build conversations by listening and responding. They share feelings rather than letting them simmer. Twenty-six budding citizens come spring. My daughter often suggests we start and end our school day at home just like Ms. Todd, offering a hug, handshake or high-five. Maria always took Todd’s hugs. Most kids did. “I’m used to getting 50 hugs a day,” Todd says on the phone in late March, adding with a laugh, “My dogs get a lot of hugs now.” In the school building, there’s comfort in routine, in marshaling bodies into their rightful, safe places and seeing the same kids every day, gauging their moods. For Todd and other educators, it’s unnatural to suddenly dam that flow and movement. “I wonder what certain kids are doing, if they’re getting what they need,” Todd says. “School is a place where kids get a lot of basic needs met — food, clothing, a sense of belonging.” On the evening I talk to Todd, she, along with the entire district, is cramming for the weeks ahead. JCPS is going “virtual.” Many teachers forgo the scheduled end-of-March spring break to get ready. With more than 150 schools and 99,000 students scattered in neighborhoods of deep poverty or comfortable wealth and resources, shifting school online is an Herculean task. Take Olmsted Academy South in south Louisville. At the all-girls middle school, 24 different languages are spoken by students and their families and about 80 percent of the student population qualifies for free and reduced-price lunch. Over spring break, five ESL teachers contact roughly 100 households to ask if they have a computer or are in need of a JCPS-issued Chromebook laptop, knowing that some families may not have received or understood communication in district emails or in the media. Even after all that effort, teachers can’t reach about 30 families with the contact information they have on file. (Staff at Olmsted and throughout the district will shift to social media or other means to try and communicate with those hard-to-reach households.) JCPS ships and hand-delivers about 20,000 Chromebooks to students throughout the county. Spectrum and other internet providers promise free or reduced-cost Wi-Fi service. (Public school districts across the country are doing the same. According to the New York Times, the Miami-Dade County public schools in Florida distributed more than 80,000 mobile devices for distance learning and about 11,000 smartphones to serve as Wi-Fi hot spots.) Veteran paper-and-pencil teachers parallel park into technology. (“The kids are impressed with what we can do,” I recently heard a JCPS middle school principal say.) Constructing an entirely new school system in less than a month — who could’ve imagined? This is all an experiment. No guarantees. And no one wants to fail. Angela Allen, the principal of Olmsted Academy South, feels the enormity of it. Online learning “isn’t designed for a district this large,” she says. There’s so much to do: Overseeing online curriculum for nearly 700 students, all at different skill levels, with different levels of support at home; walking teachers through this journey; responding to worried parents: Where’s my Chromebook? Can I get mental-health support for my kid? She needs a moment in the day just to talk to someone. The message from JCPS administration: Be flexible. “No one is throwing a gradebook in our face, saying you must do a certain number of activities,” one Olmsted teacher tells me. Still, in late March and early April, Allen has adopted this schedule: 5:30 a.m.: Wake up. Dress like she’s going to school. Joke from her husband as she heads downstairs: “Commute’s gonna be tough this morning.” 7 a.m.: Planning, emails, planning, emails, meetings. 5:30 or 6 p.m.: Pause for dinner. Another joke from her husband: “Aren’t you going to let your employees go home?” 7 or 8 p.m.: Back to emails and planning and meetings. 2:30 or 3 a.m.: Grab a few hours of sleep before it all starts again. One of the first students I think about (other than my own) when school shuts down is an eighth-grader at Olmsted Academy South named Nor Almansouri. I had interviewed her in February for a story about students who take months-long absences from school to visit the countries where either they or their parents were born. In November 2018, in her eighth-grade year, she, her parents and three siblings traveled to Iraq after an aunt died. She figured they’d return in the winter or spring. But civil unrest in the country made her parents too nervous to travel. The family stayed in Iraq indefinitely. “I heard gunshots all the time,” Almansouri recalled in February, her dark brown eyes watering. “My health got bad over it. My personality sort of changed.” But it wasn’t all scary. She loved time with distant relatives, and she brightens when remembering the first wedding she attended. Almansouri finally returned to Louisville in January, more than a year after departing. She thought she’d enter high school, but because she missed so much of eighth grade, JCPS placed her back at Olmsted. Double-dipping into middle school, this time without friends who have since moved on, felt like punishment. “I don’t like students saying to me, ‘Oh, you’re retrying eighth grade?’” she said in February. “That’s not it. I’m just finishing what I’ve started.” Three weeks after we spoke, her eighth-grade year paused again. Jason Rahmel, a resource teacher at Olmsted, fears online learning will limit his ability to tend to students’ emotional needs. “Our kids don’t get ignored at school,” he says. “We’re not following kids around, but you start to notice when kids are off and you can step in.” Rahmel can detect anger or sadness by the way a student fiddles with their locker or in the shuffle of their step. “You can email a kid and ask them how they’re doing. They can say: Fine. It’s so different than seeing them in the hallway,” Rahmel explains. Many schools have library assistants and other non-teachers reaching out to students and families. I get a call at least once a week from Bloom. A chipper voice asks me if we’ve had problems with online learning, and then asks to speak with my daughter — who, most of the time, stares at the phone with a shy grin, unsure of what to say. We also receive cheerful postcards from Bloom with a phone number to call if needed. Allen, the Olmsted principal, records daily morning greetings for her students that are delivered to their cellphones: Gooooood morning, OAS students, staff and parents! Less garbled than the tinny boom of school speakers, it’s still comforting, familiar. “I imagine me sitting in class,” Almansouri says on the phone in April. “It’s got a good OAS vibe.” Her father is still working. “He’s an essential worker in food distribution,” Almansouri says. She has stepped up around the house, waking with her baby brother, feeding him crackers and juice and reading him books. She hasn’t gotten her JCPS Chromebook as of mid-April, but she’s still able to Google chat with teachers on the family computer. Despite missing most of her second eighth-grade year, Almansouri says she will be a high school freshman this fall. On that Friday in March that school got out, she remembers her fellow students celebrating. “You don’t get it,” she recalls saying. “I want to be in school.” Online instruction in Kentucky is technically called non-traditional instruction, or NTI, a 2011 invention to continue education during an extended school closure — typically due to weather. It sounds precise and bureaucratic, a well-devised plug to fill the gap. As a parent experiencing it in this long, drawn-out moment, I’ve watched Google Meets suffer what sounds like glitchy indigestion. At least in my house, even the most engaging assignments can’t always fend off the distraction of a rowdy younger brother, shelves of toys and a kitchen stocked with snacks that my daughter is on a daily quest to consume. There’s a lot of time to fill and NTI wasn’t built to replace all that’s packed into a typical school day. My husband and I are lucky — we still have jobs that allow us to work from home, but balancing our work with first grade requires a carousel of laptops and juggled hours. At least we have a couple of devices to share. Nini Mohamed, an author and substitute teacher, who is friends with many in the Somali and immigrant community, says he knows some families who have five or more kids trying to share one JCPS-issued Chromebook. “They all have assignments due at the same time and they don’t know who to give it to,” he says. (He created a lighthearted YouTube video about the predicament titled “When JCPS sends one computer to a house hold of 10 students.”) In late April, JCPS touts NTI’s success, pointing to a 94-percent participation rate among students. An April New York Times piece indicated some school districts were getting barely half of students to participate in distance learning. In listening to JCPS teachers, it’s clear some kids are going above and beyond. And, yes, a majority of students are logging onto NTI or, at the very least, having weekly contact with teachers, the minimal requirement to be considered actively participating in NTI. The level of actual work, though, varies greatly. In a Facebook Live event hosted by the Louisville Urban League in late April, Marcella Franklin-Williams, principal of Carrithers Middle School in Jeffersontown says some students are struggling with “using their time wisely to turn work in.” Joseph Wood, the principal of Indian Trail Elementary in Newburg, says, “A lot of kids are going into Google Classroom, but not doing the work.” Some teachers I talk to aren’t terribly worried about it. Kids are resilient. So the summer slide balloons a bit. Teachers can make up for lost learning. And there’s so much else to worry about now, like parents who have been laid off and can’t afford food or rent. Or parents at risk of contracting the virus because they still report to a jobsite. Or sick relatives. School can wait. In an historically inequitable country, the pandemic will strike poor and minority communities the hardest. By early April, a disparate number of African-Americans are contracting the virus in Kentucky, and across the country more Black people are dying. Minority and economically disadvantaged children already behind in school will likely slip further, widening a lingering achievement gap in JCPS. A WFPL story from late April shows schools with higher rates of students receiving free and reduced-price lunch show less engagement with NTI. Latasha Harrison is president of the Louisville Parent Teacher Organization, an education advocacy group. Her 16-year-old attends Kentucky Country Day, and three of her children attend JCPS schools. She applauds the efforts of JCPS but says the difference between KCD’s online curriculum and that of JCPS is striking. “My daughter (at KCD) never stopped school,” she says. “She’s had school from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. every day.” Her daughter attends classes through Google Meet, and it’s about as close to normal as possible — live lessons and participation, regular assignments. “It’s not that JCPS wouldn’t want to do that,” Harrison says. “It’s simply a lack of resources. KCD is a private school and you pay to go there.” Harrison has heard from a few parents resisting NTI. “I got a few parents who were like, ‘I’m just not going to do it.’ I’m like, ‘You have no choice. This is your kids’ education,’” Harrison says. “Parents are freaking out more than kids. It’s going to get better.” Silver linings have emerged. Greg Vann, who works in the JCPS Diversity, Equity and Poverty department, says the pandemic may make clear that “tech equity is racial equity.” One teacher tells me that, without the pressure of end-of-year testing, there’s an emergence of creative, fun assignments. Kym Rice is the principal of the Academy @ Shawnee, a magnet middle and high school. She says some of her students who skipped out on regular school participate in NTI. “I think a lot of it is it’s more relaxed. They can do it on their own time,” she says during the Urban League Facebook event. “It’s not just 7:30 to 2:30 every day.” Jennifer Miescke, an ESL teacher at Olmsted Academy South, says she has watched one student who was “almost defiantly unengaged” at Olmsted thrive online. “She doesn’t want any attention drawn to the fact that she needs extra help,” Miescke says. “But since she’s been at home doing it by herself, she’s doing so much more work.” I’ve been avoiding telling my daughter she’s not heading back to Bloom this year. But by April 23 I can’t delay anymore. It will likely come up in her online class meeting. As Maria sits down to her oatmeal, I ease into the news, expecting disappointment, maybe tears. “So this virus…” I begin. Her face withers, modestly. “What about first-grade graduation?” she asks. “We usually have a party on the last day of school.” (By “usually,” she means the end-of-year party that occurred only once in her life, last year in kindergarten.) “We’ll have a party here,” I say. “Can we have doughnuts and sushi?” “Yup.” Maria mentally notes her party for the last day of school — May 27 — and eats her oatmeal, unfazed. She rotates through math pages, a social studies assignment on communities and attends a glitch-free Google Meet. Ms. Todd appears onscreen, a whiteboard behind her in her home, and sings with her students their good morning song: I said hello! (Clap, clap.) And how are you? (Clap, clap.) I said hello and get down and get down and get down... Even without a classroom, there’s a pact most teachers form with students that they simply cannot go back on, no matter the circumstance. I watch a news story about a Southern Indiana teacher who has created corny but sweet math lessons in her bathroom, shower cap on, a little jingle and all. Bloom’s music teacher, Michelle Lewis, started a daily Facebook Live drum circle in the days after school let out, setting an iPhone against a glass on a piano bench in her living room. Music is a “beautiful language,” Lewis says one day in late March. “If you are stressed out, this can help you.” On a recent afternoon, Maria’s NTI day dissolves. A Google Meet to listen to her librarian read a book turns into a pixelated puddle and chopped words. “This wouldn’t happen at school,” she says, her face sagging. Later, there are tears — about what, I can’t recall. I text Ms. Todd that Maria might like to FaceTime with her. The following day, Todd calls. “Do you know where I am?” Ms. Todd asks. Maria squints at my iPhone. “Ummm. Your car?” “Come outside.” Todd is across the street hanging out her car window, smiling. Maria giggles and jumps on our sidewalk, her sparkly heart barrette slipping from the corner of her forehead to the top of her ear. She and Todd chat about dogs and sharks and California. This isn’t the first-grade year either of them expected, but there’s a loose resemblance. Todd points her to a gift bag on our porch. Maria leaps toward it, discovering a math workbook, notepad and pencil. In case I am wary of potential germs, she has even tucked a Clorox wipe in the handle.",0.0
1619327234,2020-05-28 14:36:39,Minneapolis officials ask for 'peace and calm' in protests over George Floyd's death,http://rssfeeds.whas11.com/~/625410604/0/whas/home~Minneapolis-officials-ask-for-peace-and-calm-in-protests-over-George-Floyds-death,en,False,,94322,whas11.com,http://www.whas11.com/#spider,"While most protests have been peaceful, some factions have left vandalism, fires and looting in their wake. MINNEAPOLIS — Tensions continue to mount on night three of sustained demonstrations across the Twin Cities metro following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. While most of the protests have been peaceful, both honoring the late Floyd and the social justice movement, some factions have left vandalism, fires and looting in their wake. People rioting have breached the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct and set the building on fire as of reports coming in around 10:30 p.m. Thursday night. Minneapolis Police Spokesperson John Elder said in a statement that they had evacuated staff from the building due to safety concerns shortly after 10 p.m. According to Elder, ""Protesters forcibly entered the building and have ignited several fires."" Reporter Danny Spewak described the facility surrounded by flames on Twitter. The City of Minneapolis put out a tweet Thursday warning citizens to stay away from MPD's Third Precinct building, citing unconfirmed reports of cut gas lines and explosive materials in the building. Weighing in on Twitter, President Trump blamed the emergent social disturbance on a lack of local leadership, and threatened to send in the federal National Guard unless the city was brought under control. The president went on to tweet, ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"" In a 1 a.m. press conference Friday morning, Frey said rioting posed an imminent threat to the safety of the officers and staffers within MPD's Third Precinct, forcing him to make the decision to evacuate the compound. “Symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life or the public,” Frey said. “We could not risk serious injury to anyone … brick and mortar is not as important as life.” The Mayor went on to say that the people of the Third Precinct could continue to expect to see a police presence, and that public safety services and resources to the public would remain intact. However, he went on to say that progress during this crisis would not come from the government alone. “We additionally need help from the community. We need to make sure that people are looking out for our city right now. It's not just enough to do the right thing for yourself. We need to make sure that all of us are upholding the ideals that we stand by.” Although the mayor acknowledged the pain and frustration in recent days, he made it clear, the devastation is unacceptable. “What we have seen over the past couple of nights in terms of looting is unacceptable. These are businesses. These are community institutions that we need. These are banks that people rely on to get cash, grocery stores that people rely on to get food … We need to ensure that they are protected.” Frey said this is one of the most difficult situations the city of Minneapolis has ever been through, and that Minneapolis would pull through with a united front, stating both his chief of fire and chief of police have his 100% support. Earlier in the day, people had gathered at the intersection of 38th and Chicago in downtown Minneapolis at the scene of Floyd's death. In one location, Minneapolis artists worked to paint a mural of Floyd. ""Hopefully, it’s a reminder that this should never happen again, and people need to step up in every way that they can to stand up against these corrupt systems,"" said Xena Goldman, one of the artists. In Minneapolis, a powerful moment occurred. An entire crowd just went silent, took a knee and raised a fist in remembrance of George Floyd. Elsewhere, shopkeepers and business owners were forced to clean up in the wake of vandalism and fires that were reported throughout the Twin Cities. In one of the many examples, Gus from Augie’s in downtown Minneapoils off Hennepin Avenue told KARE 11 protesters shattered a door to the BuzzMart despite their pleas. Luckily he says they, and some of the crowd, deterred anyone from entering. Business owners along Lake Street in south Minneapolis spent Thursday cleaning up debris and boarding up windows after a night of protests, fires, looting and damage. Some business owners in south Minneapolis spent the previous night trying to protect their businesses from looters. Thursday night as more destruction spread, some businesses placed signs in their windows letting people know they were a minority-owned business.

Executive Order 20-65 authorizes the guard to work with local government agencies to provide ""personnel, equipment and facilities"" to help respond to the present emergency, according to a news release put out by the governor's office. “It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect. George Floyd’s death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction. As George Floyd’s family has said, ‘Floyd would not want people to get hurt. He lived his life protecting people.’ Let’s come together to rebuild, remember, and seek justice for George Floyd,” said Governor Walz. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced Thursday that he had asked Walz to activate the guard to help local law enforcement, as protests escalated into violence and looting overnight Wednesday. In a statement put out on the Minnesota National Guard's Twitter handle, Major General Jon Jensen said, ""We are ready and prepared to answer the Governor's request. We are currently in process of assigning and preparing units to respond."" PHOTOS: Protests for George Floyd in Minneapolis 5-28-2020 1/9 2/9 3/9 4/9 5/9 6/9 7/9 8/9 9/9 1 / 9 The press release also states nearly 200 Minnesota State Patrol troopers, along with State Patrol helicopters and fixed wind aircraft, will be at the disposal of state, county and local community public safety agencies. According to the release, the state's response will be conducted from the State Emergency Operations Center. Already activated under the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the site will now serve the dual task of helping to coordinate public health needs, as well as addressing safety issues surrounding the evolving tensions in Minneapolis. Frey and other city officials held a news conference earlier Thursday to address protests and unrest happening across Minneapolis. “The emotion-ridden conflict over last night is the result of so much built-up anger and sadness,"" Frey said. ""Anger and sadness that has been ingrained in our black community, not just because of 5 minutes of horror, but 400 years.” Frey said that in the coming days there will be an all-out effort to restore peace in the city. City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins stepped to the podium and said people have rights to express their anger, but should not do so by causing violence. ""We need peace and calm in our streets and I am begging you for that,"" Jenkins said. ""I have spent the last 41 years as a resident of this city and this is my home. And we cannot allow outsiders or our own Minneapolitan residents to destroy our city. So we want to work together to ensure that people have their voices heard in a safe manner. And that's my commitment."" Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said he cannot allow criminal acts to threaten the safety of the city. He said he wants to create safe spaces for people to gather and grieve the death of George Floyd. ""I know that our community is in trauma and that they are trying to find ways to heal,"" Arradondo said. ""Even prior to Mr. Floyd's death we have had a community that has been in trauma for quite some time. What I cannot allow as chief is for others to compound that trauma."" Arradondo said most people gathered peacefully but that there were groups of people who were causing destruction. ""The vast majority of people that have come to gather have done so peacefully,"" Arradondo said. He added that there were people involved in the overnight unrest who did not appear to be local. ""There were certainly people who were involved in the activities last night who were certainly not recognized as being part of the city."" Mayor Frey added that businesses that were looted and damaged are ""staples in the community."" ""But more important, in the time of a pandemic they are essential for community needs,"" he said. Multiple buildings, including businesses, homes and a construction site were engulfed in flames Thursday morning as fire crews across Minneapolis worked to contain the blaze. The Minneapolis Fire Department says 911 logs show engines responded to approximately 30 fire events during the unrest along East Lake Street, including at least 16 that involved structures on fire. During those responses engines and equipment suffered damage from rocks and other objects thrown at them. Minneapolis fire personnel remain on scene Thursday putting down active fires and remaining hot spots. Fires broke out at businesses in the area of Lake Street after demonstrations following the police-involved death of Floyd turned chaotic. An AutoZone, a Cub Foods, and an apartment complex under construction were reportedly among the structures impacted by the fires. St. Paul Police spokesman Steve Linders confirmed that approximately 40 St. Paul officers had been deployed to protect and aid Minneapolis firefighters trying to put down the fires. Reports of looting and property damage began Wednesday night, as a peaceful protest following the death of George Floyd turned ""from bad to worse,"" according to KARE 11's Deevon Rahming, who was on scene for a number of hours. A spokesman for Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey confirms that the mayor has requested the assistance of the National Guard to help regain control of the situation. In other developments, multiple reports say the Rev. Jesse Jackson is headed for Minneapolis, and is expected to hold a news conference around 1 p.m. The Rev. Al Sharpton posted on his Twitter account that he is headed for the Twin Cities as well. Earlier Wednesday, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo urged people observing or participating in protests to do so with safety in mind.",0.0

Federal and state authorities on Thursday promised a swift and thorough investigation as the city's leaders called for peace to be restored and Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order to activate the Minnesota National Guard. ""That video is graphic and horrific and terrible and no person should do that,"" Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said at a press conference. He said investigators needed time to determine if the video showed a criminal offense: ""We have to do this right.” Four officers were fired shortly after video of the encounter spread on social media showing Floyd struggling and telling the officers he couldn't breathe. Investigators took an unusual step in announcing an in-progress federal investigation, U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald said. She joined Freeman and other officials in offering condolences to Floyd's family and pleading for peaceful protests. Calling the Floyd’s death a “disturbing” loss of life, MacDonald promised a “a robust and meticulous investigation” and said the Department of Justice is making the case a “top priority.” Floyd's death has sparked a national outcry for justice in other cities, as well. Follow the George Floyd story:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox Here's what we know Thursday: Minnesota National Guard activated Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order to activate the Minnesota National Guard, a move that came at the request of local leaders after ""peaceful protests evolved into a dangerous situation for protesters and first responders,"" according to a release. ""As George Floyd’s family has said, ‘Floyd would not want people to get hurt. He lived his life protecting people.’ Let’s come together to rebuild, remember, and seek justice for George Floyd,” the release quotes Walz. The order also declares a peacetime emergency, allowing the a State Emergency Operations Center to be activated. The center is also involved in coordinating support amid the coronavirus pandemic. The National Guard will work to protect peaceful demonstrators and small business owners, Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan said, according to a in the release. Police report continued violence, looting Thursday Police say they are working to disperse crowds in Saint Paul on Thursday afternoon amid reports of looting and violence. ""Officers are giving dispersal orders to groups gathered in various areas of the city, damaging property and attempting to steal from businesses,"" the Saint Paul Police Department tweeted. Minutes later, the department tweeted: ""Officers are having rocks, liquor bottles and bricks thrown at them in the area of the Target on University Avenue."" A video tweeted by Minnesota Public Radio reporter Tim Nelson shows a large crowd clashing with a police presence outside the store. A short distance away from that location, cars lined up to Big Top liquors, where cases of alcohol were unloaded out of a back door in broad daylight. Three officers huddled by a nearby GNC store watched from about 100 yards away, but did not intervene. Metro Transit of Minneapolis and St. Paul says bus and light rail service will be suspended starting at 4 p.m. through Thursday ""out of concern for the safety of our riders and our employees."" Minneapolis still reels; mayor says feeling sadness and anger is 'right' Smoke still billowed from buildings Thursday morning after another night of protests. A video shared on Twitter by Minnesota Public Radio photojournalist Evan Frost showed people gathering again outside police's Third Precinct by mid-morning. Officers stood with face shields around the building and on its roof. Photos from journalists around Minneapolis showed buildings burnt, windows smashed, debris thrown about and empty store shelves from overnight looting. At a press conference Thursday afternoon, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said that he was authorizing the use of a central command so that Minneapolis police could restore peace and security in the city. Frey said he understood that the anger and sadness that led to protests has been ""built up"" over 400 years and comes not just from Floyd's death. ""If you're feeling that sadness and that anger, it's not only understandable, it's right,"" Frey said. ""We must restore the peace so that we can do this hard work together,"" Frey said. ""This could be a point in time, when several years from now, we can look back to know that we rose to right the wrongs of the past. Not just with words but with action."" During the news conference, Minneapolis Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins sang the opening of ""Amazing Grace."" ""We feel as if there was a knee on all of our collective necks – a knee that says black life does not matter,"" Jenkins said. Jenkins said city leaders would be working with black community leaders to set up a “healing space” at the site of the third precinct, where people could gather to “grieve, express their concerns, their anger, in a safe and humane way.” Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said the majority of protests were peaceful, some of the protesters “were not recognized” as being from the city. “The vast majority of our Minneapolis community was not participating in the criminal conduct that occurred last night,” Arradondo said. Clashes between police, protesters as flames, looting engulf Minneapolis The Minneapolis Fire Department said in a statement Thursday that firefighters responded to approximately 30 fires overnight, including at least 16 structure fires. The department said no civilians or firefighters were injured in the blazes, but protesters hurled rocks and projectiles at fire vehicles. Assistant Chief Bryan Tyner said in an email that he wasn't sure how many fires were set individually versus jumping from building to building. Photos shared on social media showed massive flames, including a building under construction. Star Tribune video journalist Mark Vancleave tweeted that neighbors sprayed their homes with garden houses to try to stop the flames from spreading to other structures. An AutoZone store was also ablaze, and many smaller stores appeared to have windows shattered. Videos showed a nearby Target being looted. Vancleave also tweeted that protesters lit fireworks toward police. Officers were in riot gear, and the National Guard was called out to the local police precinct, the Star Tribune reported. At one point, officers fired noise devices and projectiles toward a crowd of dozens gathered outside the Third Precinct. The nonlethal shots were fired after a group of protesters rolled dumpsters onto the street. The protests continued for hours, with some throwing objects at police and officers spraying water from low-pressure hoses to keep control. Other videos in Floyd's death New cellphone, surveillance and body camera videos released since the original video of Floyd's death show the details surrounding how police arrested and detained Floyd. One video shows Minneapolis police officers pulling Floyd from a blue Mercedes SUV as they put handcuffs on him. Minneapolis police's statement about Floyd's arrest says that ""he physically resisted officers"" after getting out of the vehcile, however, the video shows two officers grabbing Floyd and pulling him from the vehicle. Another surveillance video shows the officers handcuffing Floyd and walking him toward the wall of a building. Floyd sits handcuffed on the ground before an officer lifts him up. Floyd appears to speak with the officer though there is no sound. Another officer walks over and they both bring Floyd across the street. KARE 11 reported that the video came from Dragon Wok, a business at the intersection where Floyd was arrested. Minneapolis Park Police also released heavily redacted body camera footage from an officer who arrived at the scene. KMSP-TV reported that the park police officer was responding to a request for assistance from Minneapolis Police but not involved in Floyd's arrest. Video shows the officer standing by the car from which Floyd was arrested. George Floyd's brother: Minneapolis police 'executed my brother' In an interview with CNN Thursday morning, Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother, also called for peaceful protests in Minneapolis. Philonise Floyd said he wanted to see the officers involved arrested immediately. The four officers were identified Wednesday, but no charges have been filed despite pleas from the Floyd family, Frey and others in the city. ""These officers, they need to be arrested right now. They need to be arrested and held accountable for everything,"" Floyd told CNN. Asked whether he had seen the video of the officer holding his knee to his brother's neck, Floyd said, holding back tears: ""I watched the video. It was hard but I had to watch the video. As I watched the video, those four officers, they executed my brother."" Ben Crump, an attorney representing the Floyd family, told CNN that the family would be seeking an independent autopsy. The city has not yet released an autopsy report in Floyd's death. ""They offered him no humanity while keeping his knee on his neck. Members of the public were the only ones trying to deescalate the situation. Not the police,"" Crump said. Jesse Jackson: George Floyd could have been any one of my sons Rev. Jesse Jackson urged further ""disciplined"" protests and came to Minnesota on Thursday to speak with religious leaders. Jackson, 78, speaking with USA TODAY, implored Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to press charges against the four officers. “You murder somebody, you don’t get fired, you get charged with murder,"" Jackson said. ""If Floyd had done this to a white person, he'd be in jail today, bond too high to reach."" Jackson said Floyd could have been any one of his three sons, who are near the age of Floyd, who was 46. Protesters should continue to take action until charges are announced, Jackson said. He said black people have been ""brutalized without consequence"" for decades. Damaging demonstrations, which included looted businesses and burnt buildings Wednesday, are the result of decades of military-like policing tactics all across the country, Jackson said. ""I understand the pain and the frustration. Seeing as all else has failed, they need this to get attention,"" he added. Previous complaints had been filed against fired Minneapolis officers Police identified the officers Wednesday as Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng. Attorney Tom Kelly said he was representing Chauvin, the officer seen with his knee on Floyd's neck. The service records of the four officers involved in the incident were no longer public, as they were part of the ongoing investigation, Minneapolis police said Wednesday. According to The Associated Press, Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 in a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. In 2011, Chauvin was one of several officers put on temporary leave after a police shooting in a residential community, according to local news reports. Thao was sued for excessive use of force in 2017, according to the Star-Tribune. Several complaints have been filed against both officers, according to Communities United Against Police Brutality, a Twin-Cities based organization. Chauvin received three oral reprimands as well as seven other closed complaints for which he was not disciplined. Thao was not disciplined in five closed complaints. One case remains open. Minnesota politicians 'outraged' by George Floyd's death Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said on on SiriusXM’s ""The Joe Madison Show"" said that he was worried about both under or over charging the officers invovled in the case. ""I will tell you that if this was just charged, if the top count was negligent homicide, that would be a shame,"" Ellison said. Ellison also said that if charges are filed and the case were to go to trial, he wouldn't support moving the trial to a different jurisdiction. He said he wanted ""a just outcome."" ""Don't you remember Rodney King? You know, those guys were acquitted. The guy who killed Walter Scott, that jury was a hung jury. We've got to make sure this thing is done right if you want to make things go according to a just outcome,"" he said. ""Speechless"" and ""outraged"" were the words state Sen. Jeff Hayden, representing the southern Minneapolis district where George Floyd was killed, used to describe his feelings of Floyd’s death. ""Every Minnesotan should feel safe in their community and every part of our state,"" said Hayden, a Democrat who represents District 62. ""This tragedy has left our entire community in grief."" One of Hayden’s concerns was the power of the Minneapolis Police Department’s union, saying the organization is “part of the problem” when trying to weed out bad officers. Hayden implored people to focus on justice for Floyd as opposed to the damage to property. ""Not that we wanted (businesses destroyed) but they can be rebuilt. We can't bring back Mr. Floyd,"" he said. Contributing: The Associated Press Follow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller",0.0

Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, who in March was shot and killed in her apartment by Louisville police — one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. Anger over the deaths boiled over in protests across the U.S. on Thursday evening, including the violent clash on Louisville's streets that, as of early Friday morning, had left at least one gunshot victim in critical condition. Louisville police did not shoot their guns, according to an LMPD spokesperson. Buy Photo A young woman holds up a fist in the intersection of Sixth and Jefferson Streets. May 28, 2020 (Photo: Pat McDonogh / Courier Journal) ""It is not a riot,"" said Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey, who watched as hundreds gathered Thursday night. ""It is a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed. What I'm seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration."" Dorsey, D-3rd District, represents Shively and part of western Louisville. Who was Breonna Taylor? What we know about the Louisville ER tech Also: Breonna Taylor protest in downtown Louisville draws hundreds. Here's what we know In what began as a peaceful demonstration, an estimated 500 to 600 people marched through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of paintballs at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. Protesters tore off the right hand of the King Louis XVI statue that stands on a pedestal at Sixth and Jefferson streets. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer responded to the unrest shortly before midnight, posting on Twitter, ""Understandably, emotions are high,"" along with a statement posted earlier in the evening from Taylor's family. That statement, attributed to Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, thanked protesters for ""giving Bre a voice tonight,"" while also asking crowds to ""keep it peaceful."" Fischer's tweet concluded: ""As Breonna’s mother says, let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice."" Hear from our reporter from the scene: Courier Journal's Cameron Teague Robinson shares what he saw at Breonna Taylor protest Protesters flooded downtown just hours after The Courier Journal obtained and reported Thursday afternoon the 911 call made in the immediate aftermath of Taylor's death. The 26-year-old EMT died in the hall of her apartment after police officers executed a ""no-knock"" search warrant in the early morning hours of March 13 as part of a narcotics investigation. She was struck by at least eight bullets. Throughout the evening, many protesters could be seen holding both hands in the air, as if to show they were unarmed. ""We came for peace,"" one man said over a bullhorn. Most of those gathered appeared to be wearing face masks. Rally organizers led chants. Signs were held high. One read, ""Who do you call when police murder?"" What we know: Breonna Taylor protest in downtown Louisville draws hundreds Early on, large crowds chanted, ""No justice! No peace! Prosecute the police!"" Protesters, many of them white, linked arms, forming a wall across Sixth Street between Louisville City and Metro halls. One held a sign that read, ""Until all police states burn we fight for black lives."" “Say her name!” yelled Chanelle Helm, a leader for Black Lives Matter Louisville. “Breonna!” the crowd called in return. By 10 p.m., at least one group could be seen verbally clashing with police officers near the Yum Center. The officers carried wooden batons and were wearing body armor and face shields. An armored truck was stationed nearby. ""Good cops need to start speaking up and standing up!"" one man yelled. “My son is 13 and is scared to walk down the street!"" shouted a woman. ""Please avoid the area until further notice!"" a Twitter post from Louisville Metro Police said. 911 call from shooting: 'Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend' At one point, protesters threw things at police officers and kicked a patrol car. When one officer was surrounded by protesters near Bearno's by the Bridge, a pizza parlor near the Second Street bridge and the Yum Center, protest organizers stepped in to make sure the officer was not harmed.

(Photo: Michael Clevenger/Courier Journal) Around 11 p.m., a line of officers advanced down East Main Street, dispersing a large crowd. But not long after, hundreds congregated in front of Metro Hall, where a group of protesters had been trying to tip an armored vehicle, breaking its windows and slashing its tires. Multiple rounds of gunfire then rang out. At least seven injured people, their wounds seeping blood, were seen being carried away on stretchers. Read more: What to know about the investigations into the shooting of Taylor Protesters in recent days have demanded that officers involved in Taylor's death — identified by the department as Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly and officers Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove — be fired. They've also called for a ban on no-knock warrants. No drugs were recovered from Taylor's home. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired his weapon and struck a police officer in the femoral artery as they entered the apartment, and Taylor was struck in the ensuing gunfire. In the 911 call, Walker can be heard crying out Taylor's name and calling for help as he tries to speak to a dispatcher. ""I don't know what is happening,"" said Walker, 27. ""Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend."" Her death has sparked questions from activists and family members about what led to the fatal shooting and drastically increased pressure on local officials in recent weeks. Police Chief Steve Conrad announced last week he would retire at the end of June, and Fischer has said he's turned over findings of an internal police investigation to the U.S. Attorney's Office and FBI. The FBI has also opened its own independent investigation. The Courier Journal late Tuesday sued the city's police department for records related to the investigation after officials refused to turn them over. Bernard Bradberry, 44, came to the protest with his 16-year-old son, A.J. Hall. ""We want justice,"" said A.J., who pushed his father along the downtown streets in a wheelchair. Bradberry said many African Americans in Louisville are angered by more than just Taylor's death. “Because of all the other violence going on in the country, too,"" he said. ""All of it’s been led up to this."" The Louisville protests come less than a day after unrest erupted in Minneapolis in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. Protests in Minneapolis continued Thursday night, with large crowds also rallying in Phoenix, Denver and Columbus, Ohio. Read more: 'It is not a riot. It is a revolt': Councilwoman responds to protest In downtown Louisville, Bradberry called what he and others see as a lack of police accountability ""a slap in the face."" ""It’s like, do they even feel sorry for what they’ve done?"" he asked. Courtney Artis, of Jeffersontown, said she attended the protest because she was “tired of police.” “It’s not right that they keep killing black people,” she said. “My parents are from Birmingham, Alabama, and I’m tired of them repeating history. We’ve been peaceful too long, so that’s why we’re out here.” Artis said she hoped the protest would pressure officials to charge the officers involved in Taylor’s death. “They need to go to jail like anybody else would,” she said. “If I killed somebody, I would get held accountable, right? Right. So, I want them to be held accountable also.” USA TODAY contributed to this report.

Louisville Metro Police Department spokesperson Alicia Smiley said police made some arrests, but she couldn’t say how many as “the situation is ongoing.” LMPD spokesperson Jessie Halladay said in an email that no officers fired their weapons. Shots could be heard on live streams of the protest before 11:30 p.m., and a WFPL reporter saw two men injured by gunfire at the northeast corner of Jefferson and Sixth streets. Police officers found the men in the crowd and rendered aid, according to reporter Ryan Van Velzer. Here's audio of @RyanVanVelzer describing what he saw. Two people in front of him were shot on the northeast corner of Jefferson and 6th. pic.twitter.com/RlW9FYjeux — 89.3 WFPL News (@WFPLNews) May 29, 2020 The shooting came after several hours of largely peaceful protest through downtown Louisville. At least several hundred demonstrators walked through downtown, chanted “No justice, no peace,” and blocked the street near Louisville Metro Hall. Halladay of LMPD said during a media briefing around 11:30 p.m. that police were trying to give protesters their space. We are doing our best to try to resolve this peacefully and without conflict,” Halladay said. Protesters in downtown Louisville have broken the arm off a statue of King Louis XVI in front of City Hall. pic.twitter.com/L5XWHXihv3 — 89.3 WFPL News (@WFPLNews) May 29, 2020 Before the shots were fired at the protest Thursday evening, a demonstrator broke the arm off a statue of King Louis XVI. Some people also slashed the tires and broke the windows out of a prisoner transport vehicle stationed near Metro Hall, shortly before the gunshots. A woman on a bullhorn had tried to encourage protesters not to approach the police, who had formed a line in riot gear to hold the crowd back. Shortly before midnight, LMPD officers began ordering the crowd to disperse and threatening arrest. Tear gas and rubber bullets followed. Around 12:30 a.m., after small fires were set to a picnic table and some recycling bins near Metro Hall, LMPD shared a video from Taylor’s sister. Demonstrators lit fireworks and threw some at police. Heavy rain after 1 a.m. appeared to help clear out the scene. Mayor Greg Fischer shared a statement from Breonna Taylor’s family, asking that protesters “do not succumb to the levels that we see out of the police.” Taylor, 26, was killed in the middle of the night when Louisville Metro Police entered her apartment with a so-called “no-knock” warrant, breaking the door down, on March 13. Understandably, emotions are high. As Breonna’s mother says, let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice. pic.twitter.com/DBQ4QPxlov — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) May 29, 2020 Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he didn’t know the intruders were law enforcement; he fired his gun and struck an LMPD officer. LMPD officers shot into the apartment, striking Taylor at least eight times and killing her. Please choose peace Louisville. Here's a message from Breonna Taylor's family. https://t.co/Sb3C8H6Fn6 — LMPD (@LMPD) May 29, 2020 Early Friday morning, Fischer tweeted a video, saying he feels the community’s frustration but that violence is not the answer: I urge protesters, as Breonna Taylor’s family said tonight, to say her name. But let’s not see anyone else get hurt. Let’s work together for peace, justice & for Breonna & all of Louisville. pic.twitter.com/RHyMgUV073 — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) May 29, 2020 The protest comes the same day as lawyers for Taylor’s family released the 911 call Walker made after Taylor had been shot. Walker had originally been charged with attempted murder of a police officer, but Commonwealth’s Attorney Tom Wine announced last week he was dropping the charges. Police Chief Steve Conrad announced he will retire next month. Protests also broke out in Minneapolis and St. Paul this week after the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was suffocated by police in the street after being detained on suspicion of forgery.

1619638008,2020-05-28 23:40:14,Breonna Taylor protest in downtown Louisville draws hundreds. Here's what we know,http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625458774/0/courierjournal/home~Breonna-Taylor-protest-in-downtown-Louisville-draws-hundreds-Heres-what-we-know/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Sunday has not been a slow news day in the Bluegrass State. In the aftermath of a third night of protests that took place Saturday over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, several demonstrations have popped up across Louisville on Sunday, and city officials have released more information about what's taken place over the weekend. Here's what's happening around the city. • 10:45 p.m. — In a media briefing, Mayor Greg Fischer called for a ""day of reflection"" on Monday, as Sunday night protests began to taper off. Fischer said local faith leaders would have a virtual call on Facebook Live at 11:30 a.m. Monday to mourn those who have died in the coronavirus pandemic -- ""that's one of my worries about all these people being together,"" Fischer added. LMPD Lt. Colonel LaVita Chavous took the mic afterward and said more than 40 arrests have taken place after a peaceful protest earlier turned unlawful. She added that ""anarchists"" had ""infiltrated"" the crowd as well, and they were using the peaceful protest for their own purposes. Chavous said the peaceful protest at Jefferson Square Park was unlawful, as it took place without a permit, which led to officers breaking it up before curfew. The officer who fired pepper balls at a WAVE 3 crew on Friday, meanwhile, is being investigated and will be reassigned in the meantime, Chavous said. • 10:30 p.m. — Louisville police have addressed an allegation reported by WDRB from Metro Council President David James that protesters were fired upon because they were carrying leaf blowers with bleach to shoot at police. Six or so protesters were arrested minutes earlier near Broadway and Brook Street, while other arrests have taken place in the meantime. An estimated crowd of 1,000 had gathered earlier before sunset at Jefferson Square Park. That group split up, though, after being confronted by police. LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay, meanwhile, said while they had not confirmed protesters were carrying leaf blowers with the intent to harm police, they had seen demonstrators carrying them in the crowd. ""We saw people with leaf blowers in the crowd,"" Hallday told The Courier Journal's Sarah Ladd. ""We know those are used for things like dispensing powder chemicals and for blowing gas back toward police. We don’t have any confirmation they were used for either purpose. The threat of that use is one reason we decided to disperse the crowd prior to curfew."" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer will address media at 10:45 p.m. for a Sunday night update. • 10:15 p.m. — Police arrested around six demonstrators near Broadway and Brook Street. Louisville's curfew went into effect at 9 p.m., though police fired tear gas at protesters at Jefferson Square Park before that deadline. Last night, Mayor Greg Fischer said 40-50 people were arrested during the protests. • 9:45 p.m — Broadway was completely blocked at First Street just before 9:45 p.m. Protesters have been scattered around downtown since being split up from a meeting point at Jefferson Square Park at around 8:20 p.m. A large police presence has come to a standstill by the gas station at First Street, with a lot of police vehicles on and helicopters in the air. • 9:30 p.m — Jefferson Square Park is packed with law enforcement officials at sundown, and protesters on Broadway were met with pepper balls and tear gas, according to Courier Journal and USA TODAY reporters Darcy Costello and Natalie Alund. The crowd was heading toward the Highlands, where another large protest took place Saturday night. Tear gas is in the air, Costello said – you can feel it in your throat. Police are using vans to rapidly redeploy across the city to reach different groups of protesters. • 9 p.m — We've hit curfew in Louisville. About 1,000 protesters who rallied earlier in the evening split up after being confronted by police at around 8:15 p.m. A large police presence was by the Brown Hotel on Broadway at 9 p.m. cars honked and the sun continued to set. Car protests have been common throughout the weekend protests. • 8:45 p.m — Citing an anti-riot statute, police have taken steps early Sunday night to break up protests, even before the 9 p.m. curfew. Tear gas and flash bangs scattered crowds at Jefferson Square Park, according to Courier Journal reporter Darcy Costello, as some protesters dispersed toward Fourth Street, which has taken heavy damage amid three previous nights of demonstrations, and others spread to other pockets of downtown Louisville. Officers have cleared out Jefferson Square Park. pic.twitter.com/behNAcEglB — Darcy Costello (@dctello) June 1, 2020 Law enforcement members in full camo took their place on some downtown streets leading up to and during the confrontation. National Guard members had been called in by officials to assist after Friday's protests, while Kentucky State Police officers are also alongside Louisville Metro Police officers. • 8:20 p.m. — Protesters were told by a speaker with a megaphone to take children home just before 8 p.m., and 10 minutes later police announced that the demonstration was an ""unlawful assembly,"" though Louisville's curfew was not scheduled to begin until 9 p.m. The person with the megaphone told the crowd that tear gas and flash bangs would be fired, causing some to leave the scene. At 8:19 p.m., police followed through, firing flash bangs and tear gas into the crowd at Jefferson Square Park. • 7:45 p.m. — Protesters took to the street on Broadway and raised their fists as police officers looked on at around 7:30 p.m. Sunday, according to Courier Journal reporter Darcy Costello. The group, which numbered in the hundreds, knelt in front of Metro Corrections minutes later. The number of protesters is high Sunday night, those in the field say. Another group has gathered at Sixth and Liberty streets, where officers destroyed protesters' milk jugs and water bottles a night earlier. Meanwhile, a MetroSafe supervisor said one person was taken to the hospital with life-threatening injuries after having being shot at Seventh and Hill streets, according to Courier Journal reporter Sarah Ladd. It's unknown if the shooting is related to the protest. • 7 p.m. — By around 7 p.m, an estimated crowd of 1,000 had gathered on Broadway and Roy Wilkins, filling all six lanes of Roy Wilkins, to demand justice for Breonna Taylor. • 6 p.m. — Mayor Greg Fischer said Monday will be designated as a ""Day of Reflection"" to reflect on what needs to change to combat racism in the city. There will be a virtual gathering on Facebook Live at 11:30 a.m. The day will also honor the people from Louisville who have died from the coronavirus. Here's a quick look at what you may have missed earlier Sunday. • Around 40 people were arrested at Saturday night's protests, according to Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, as the National Guard was called in to assist. Saturday was the first day a 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. curfew was in effect — the curfew also applies Sunday night and will be reevaluated on Monday. • A number of maximum security inmates broke an interior dormitory window overnight at the jail, according to a Metro Corrections release, and they damaged some property in the jail before the disturbance was quelled. Four suffered minor injuries. None of the inmates involved were arrested at the weekend protests, the release said. • While volunteers downtown cleaned up, more demonstrations took place around town Sunday afternoon, including one notable gathering in St. Matthews and an address by local pastors at 13th Street and Broadway. • A police cruiser was hit by at least one bullet on Saturday night, Fischer said Sunday. The car was near Ninth and Broadway. Three officers were inside and no one was injured. From Saturday night A third night of protests erupted in Louisville on Saturday, with a heavier police presence taking to the streets to match the local demonstrators. The demonstrations are part of a national movement and in Louisville have taken place over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, an African American who was unarmed when police executed a ""no-knock"" search warrant at her apartment and returned fire when her boyfriend fired on them. He has said he thought they were intruders. Livestream: Third night of Breonna Taylor protests in Louisville. Watch the footage While much of what's occurred at the two protests has been peaceful, Thursday night's demonstration was marred by a shooting that injured seven people and Friday night saw looting and widespread damage throughout downtown as police fired tear gas at several groups. On Saturday, Mayor Greg Fischer and Gov. Andy Beshear called for the National Guard to assists in the city, and the added police presence was felt -- looting and major property damage did not appear to be an issue, though officers and protesters clashed throughout the night in the Highlands and downtown. The Courier Journal had reporters and photographers around the city to cover Saturday's protests in real time. Here's a look back at what happened. • 2 a.m. – A busy night across Louisville appeared to be slowing to a halt in the early hours of Sunday morning. Two people were injured in a shooting just after 11 p.m., police said, but it did not appear to have been associated with the protest. And the noise in the Highlands and in downtown Louisville had tapered off a bit as the night's demonstrations ended. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer addressed media members at 10:30 p.m. and tweeted around midnight a statement thanking those who had peacefully protested. Still, Saturday's protests were not unique to Louisville. Minnesota was a hotbed once again, but demonstrations in New York, Los Angeles (where around 500 arrests took place), Nashville, Cincinnati, Lexington and other notable metropolitan areas continued to rock the nation. • 1 a.m. – Protests had dwindled in some areas as we entered Sunday morning, but some demonstrators kept at it. A large number of officers were at the gas station at First Street and Broadway, according to The Courier Journal's Matt Glowicki, as protesters continued to make their presence known. Broadway was loud for much of the night, as cars of protesters laid on their horns to make a statement. • 12:30 a.m. – A fire broke out earlier in the evening at the McDonald's restaurant at Second Street and Broadway but had been mostly contained by 12:30 a.m. The scene on Broadway, though, was hectic, according to Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin, as a group of protesters moved through the area and were followed by police. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, meanwhile, issued a statement on Twitter thanking those who kept their cool throughout the night. ""Thanks to all who’ve abided by the curfew,"" Fischer wrote. ""I am gratified to say that the majority of people are staying home. I want to thank all those who came out tonight and protested peacefully, expressing your concerns about the tragic death of Breonna Taylor."" • Midnight – The scene had cleared significantly at Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue at midnight, with officers taking a quick snack break after using gas and what appeared to be pellet guns to clear a group of protesters at the high-profile Louisville intersection. Back in the heart of the city, near Fourth and Guthrie streets, the owner of escape room Locked In stood out front of his business with a rifle to keep back protesters after the establishment's glass door had been shattered earlier. A caravan of law enforcement vehicles traveled in front of it down the street. Micheal Snyder guards the Escape Game on Fourth Street where looters threw rocks through the door. He plans to guard it all night with his AR-15. pic.twitter.com/weuEItBbTv — Natalie Neysa Alund (@nataliealund) May 31, 2020 Meanwhile one person was taken to the hospital Saturday night after being shot on Clay Street, according to a MetroSafe supervisor. The shooting was reported at 11:05 p.m. No other information was immediately available. • 11:30 p.m. – Many protesters left the corner of Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue and others were pushed further back at 11:20 p.m. by launching some kind of gas toward the crowd, which had gathered peacefully well after the 9 p.m. curfew. Police fired pepper ball guns at those who stayed at the scene, as Courier Journal reporter Matt Glowicki broadcast live on Facebook. Near the hospitals on Floyd Street, meanwhile, a crowd kept moving with police following them, The Courier Journal's Billy Kobin reported. The two sides had not physically clashed. Kobin said dozens of cars were in the crowd, with six police vehicles following. • 11 p.m. – The scene is tense in the Highlands. Armored trucks and a large police presence have taken the corner of Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue. Police fired pepper balls and what seemed to be pepper spray at protesters after someone in the crowd threw a water bottle at the officers, The Courier Journal's Olivia Krauth reported. Traffic has been blocked off at the intersection. Courier Journal reporter Matt Glowicki has footage from the scene. Police and protesters were still on the streets downtown as well. Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin reported a large crowd moving down Broadway, with police in the area as well. • 10:45 p.m. – In a 10:30 p.m. press briefing, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said the situation on the streets was ""still evolving"" and he hoped Sunday Louisville could come together peacefully and set an example for the rest of the country. Tear gas has been deployed, Fischer said, and about 10 people have been arrested, though a Metro Corrections spokesman said earlier that number was higher. The mayor also defended officers who destroyed water bottles and milk gallons that belonged to protesters, saying flammable liquids and other hazardous materials had been placed with the water and milk. Those materials needed to • 10:15 p.m. – Metro Corrections spokesman Tracy Dotson told The Courier Journal at least 25 to 30 arrests have taken place Saturday night, a much higher number than had occurred in the previous two nights of protests. Meanwhile, the scene had cleared near Sixth and Main streets, The Courier Journal's Billy Kobin reported, while separate groups of protesters marched in other areas downtown and in NuLu and the Highlands. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer will address reporters at 10:30 p.m., his office said. • 10 p.m. – Police have fired tear gas into the crowd at Jefferson Square. At least one protester was seen being detained on Sixth Street. Mounted police were showing up near the Republic Bank building downtown. Meanwhile, there was a throng of protesters at Bardstown Road and Baxter Avenue. Police were staged at a nearby Walgreens. SWAT officers were seen gathering near Baxter and Broadway. • 9:30 p.m. – Protesters in the Highlands have continued to try to make their point, even as National Guard personnel move into the region. Much of the crowd congregated near Bardstown Road and Grinstead Drive. Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth said many protesters stopped at the Wendy's near that corner and would not go past a National Guard truck that was in the parking lot. Down the street outside Cave Hill Cemetery, Courier Journal reporter Matt Glowicki spoke with Tracy Grizzle and her daughter Abby. They live in the Highlands and came out with signs to show support. She said the protest had been peaceful. ""They're telling us to leave, so we're trying to follow the rules,"" she said, as cars passed them and honked in support. ""All it is is we're trying to get our message out."" • 9:15 p.m. – Police have deployed tear gas downtown in various areas, including outside the judicial center, as Saturday night's protests get hotter. Law enforcement officials had previously smashed milk jugs and water bottle belonging to protesters downtown earlier in the day. The officers continued to work to break up groups of protesters around Jefferson Square. Charles Booker, who is running for the Democratic nomination to run for Mitch McConnell's Senate seat in November, shared a video of police breaking up protesters with green gas well before 9 p.m. • 9 p.m. – The crowd on Sixth Street was sparse at 9 p.m., when the Saturday night curfew was set to take place. Moments earlier, Courier Journal photojournalist Pat McDonogh said, police had broken up a crowd in the area. Protesters were spread widely at Sixth and Jefferson streets in the aftermath. The Highlands protest, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth, began to splinter around 9 p.m., after a group leader said the National Guard was blocks away. • 8:45 p.m. – Groups of protesters have once again taken to different areas in the city. Protesters on Liberty Street began to flee toward sunset after a few flashbangs when off in the area around 8:30 p.m. That's happened a few times tonight, according to Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin. Along Bardstown Road, according to The Courier Journal's Olivia Krauth, a march was taking place that was mostly peaceful. The group blocked the intersection of Baxter Avenue and Broadway to get their message across. That group of protesters, Courier Journal photojournalist Michael Clevenger said, has bounced around the region quite a bit. • 8:15 p.m. — The crowd of protesters outside Metro Hall is separating. State police have deployed green smoke and pepper balls. State police warned protesters over a speaker to peacefully disperse and warned that they may dispense ""chemical agents for unlawful assembly."" The curfew officially begins at 9 p.m. • 8 p.m. – State police and LMPD are advancing toward protests outside police headquarters and the Hall of Justice at Seventh and Jefferson streets. Meanwhile, police have blocked off Bardstown Road at Lucia, just west of Mid City Mall. • 7:40 p.m. – Law enforcement officers are taking away protesters' stockpiles of water and milk at Jefferson Square. A Ford pickup pulled up on the sidewalk, and plainclothes police officers began throwing the cases of water into the back of the truck and discarding the milk, which protesters use to combat the effects of tear gas. Officers in the area have put on their gas masks. I cannot believe what I just witnessed. They pulled up onto the square with a police siren on and did this. #Louisvillepic.twitter.com/65o2lgZCJh — Natalie Neysa Alund (@nataliealund) May 30, 2020 • 7 p.m. – A crowd of about 100 protesters at Broadway and Baxter Avenue had gathered and were making their way toward the Highlands just after 7 p.m. At Sixth and Jefferson streets in downtown Lousiville, meanwhile, where the most heated moments of Thursday's protest took place, a crowd of 250 or so people had arrived from Sixth Street, chanting and blocking some cars in the area. • 6:45 p.m. – A group of protesters from Louisville blocked the Second Street Bridge into Southern Indiana. About 400 demonstrators who had marched to the bridge next to the Yum Center from Jefferson Square stood across the roadway, turning cars away to head back north to the Hoosier State. The protesters left the bridge about 15 minutes later. • 6:30 p.m. – In a sitdown interview with The Courier Journal, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer asked protesters to make their feelings known before the 9 p.m. curfew hits Saturday night. A lot of people are upset right now, Fischer said, and that's ""totally understandable."" But the tone of the protests turned Friday night, he said, and the property damage and ""anarchic element"" that came to the forefront later in the evening led to an escalation that did not need to continue on Saturday. Fischer, who said he'd been on a call with 30 other mayors earlier in the day, had brought in the National Guard earlier to assist with Saturday's protest. Systematic change is needed, he said, but ""we don't want a further escalation tonight that could potentially endanger more people. Check out more from the interview below. CLOSE Mayor Greg Fischer talked about deploying the National Guard and other decisions made after two nights of protests over the death of Breonna Taylor. Louisville Courier Journal • 5:45 p.m. – A small protest in Jeffersonville, Indiana brought together demonstrators at the Big Four Bridge. Those in attendance want the Indiana State Police to release body cam footage taken on the night Malcolm Williams was shot and killed in April by a trooper, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth. And there were some tense moments. The group ran into a crowd of hecklers on the patio of Parlour Pizza, along with some families who left amid the commotion. Things ratcheted up a notch at one point when a man from the patio got on a motorcycle and tried to leave by driving through the crowd on a two-way street. Police were blocking streets with their cars on a rolling basis as protesters moved along but did not appear to have much of a presence on foot. In Jeffersonville, Indiana, a small protest against police brutality is at the bottom of the Big Four bridge. pic.twitter.com/Ow7nVi0cue — Olivia Krauth (@oliviakrauth) May 30, 2020 Meanwhile, here's some background from earlier on Saturday. • Mayor Greg Fischer issued an executive order in the morning putting a curfew in effect through the weekend. The curfew begins at 9 p.m. Saturday and Sunday and ends at 6:30 a.m. Sunday and Monday, and excludes people traveling for work, worship or for medical purposes. Those who violate the order could be cited and will be asked to return home. • About 350 National Guard members from Kentucky will be in Louisville on Saturday in response to the previous nights' protests, Fischer and Gov. Andy Beshear announced. • All TARC Louisville bus services will be suspended at 7 p.m. Saturday, the organization announced earlier in the afternoon, but routes will resume on Sunday. • Louisville's EMW Women's Clinic, the only abortion clinic in Kentucky, was damaged Friday night, according to a Twitter post from an account operated by clinic escorts. Friday night highlights For the second night in a row, angry protesters crowded the streets and sidewalks of downtown Louisville – setting fires, blocking traffic, breaking windows, burning flags and protesting the March death of Breonna Taylor, the unarmed black woman killed in her apartment by Louisville police. The Courier Journal had reporters and photographers across downtown, talking to protesters, snapping photos and capturing videos while monitoring the situation. Here's a recap: • 1:15 a.m. – An angered Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer thanked police officers for showing restraint at Friday's protest, and said he hears those who protested peacefully. But the damage done to downtown businesses, he said, was unacceptable. ""This is not a protest. It is violence,"" Fischer said in a livestream just after 1 a.m. ""… No one stands up for justice and equality by smashing windows and burning property. This destruction will not be tolerated."" • 12:50 a.m. – A large numbers of officers moved toward the CVS on Fourth Street at around 12:45 a.m. Someone appeared to be hurt by the broken glass at the convenience store, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth. Traffic around the block backed up, Courier Journal reporter Matt Mencarini said, as the person who was injured was taken out on a stretcher. Some protesters appeared to leave the building, which had every glass window broken, with bottles of alcohol or other merchandise. Elsewhere, protesters looting a store at the downtown Omni Louisville Hotel were shown on WLKY. • 12:40 a.m. – The Kentucky International Convention Center sustained ""major glass and exterior damage"" during Friday's protest, according to Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles. The building was evacuated, he said, and it was far from the only building in downtown Louisville to take damage during the protest. • 12:30 a.m. – Protesters made off with one of the Gallopalooza horse statues in downtown Louisville, footage that aired on WLKY showed. Still elsewhere, the scene had cooled. At approximately 12:20 a.m., a line of law enforcement officers that had been standing shoulder-to-shoulder for hours by Metro Hall were at ease for the time. Each was given a bottle of water from a police vehicle. A handful of protesters half a block away could be seen throwing trash away and collecting pallets of unused water bottles and styrofoam coolers with jugs of milk inside to be taken away at the park at Sixth and Jefferson streets. A fire burned a block away on Seventh Street. • 12:20 a.m. – Groups of protesters were spread out in downtown Louisville, but it appeared some of the crowds had dwindled, according to Courier Journal reporters Olivia Krauth and Matt Mencarini. With broken windows and overturned plants behind them, many protesters left downtown. Police remained on Fifth Street and at one point threw tear gas at reporters and very few protesters on an otherwise silent Fourth Street. Still, some protesters, and a large police force, remained at various points throughout downtown. • 12:10 a.m. – LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said she's positive that the larger crowd at Friday's protest is because more out-of-town residents have made the trip to Louisville. Local police have been tracking social media posts throughout the day, she said, and learned of buses coming to Louisville from Indianapolis. Officers had also seen a large number of cars in the crowd with license plates from out of town. “It’s been a high-profile conversation and obviously we use a lot of intelligence about what’s occurring,” Halladay said. “With an active social media platform we can see a lot of people traveled here for this tonight.” • Midnight – Some crowds began to disperse downtown, though crowds remained in other areas, and the protest in the Highlands appeared to wind down. Protesters who had marched south down Bardstown Road, according to Courier Journal photographer Sam Upshaw Jr., stopped at Eastern Parkway and chanted before turning around. Their protest was peaceful, Upshaw and other Courier Journal reporters in the area reported. Some came close to engaging with a line of officers in front of Mid City Mall but were turned away by other protesters with megaphones urging them to move on. • 11:35 p.m. – No arrests have taken place Friday night, LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said in an update to media members at 11:30 p.m., and police do not believe any shots have been fired. When asked about a rumor circulating among protesters that police had been given authorization to use lethal force, Halladay characterized it as an attempt to incite panic in the crowd and get a reaction, though she added officers ""are always authorized to use lethal force if they are confronted with lethal force and they fear for their safety or the safety of others."" ""We have been doing what we can do to use these less lethal options of tear gas and pepper ball because they can help disperse and we wouldn’t have to use lethal force,"" she said. • 11:30 p.m. – WHAS was forced to evacuate its downtown Louisville studio Friday night amid protests in the area. The network's Senait Gebregiorgis tweeted at 11:20 p.m. that the TV crew had to leave after protesters smashed windows at the building. No one was hurt, she said. WHAS's office is at 520 W. Chestnut Street, three blocks from Jefferson Street. Glass has been broken out of the front of the WHAS building facing Chestnut Street, Courier Journal visual journalist Jeff Faughender reported. Large glass panes were broken out, other windows had holes in them. Graffiti with phrases like ""Pigs fly,"" was spray painted on the windows. Protesters, meanwhile, jumped on a WLKY TV van downtown, the network showed. • 11:25 p.m. – Footage showed at least two people break into the Eddie Merlot's steakhouse at Fourth Street Live and leave through shattered windows with bottles of alcohol. Protesters on the popular Louisville parying block also burned a Confederate flag, amid cheers. Looting had not been an issue at Thursday's protest, Louisville police confirmed Thursday afternoon. And while vandalism had been reported at several businesses around town Friday night, looting had not yet been seen as a widespread issue at the Louisville protests. CLOSE Footage obtained by The Courier Journal shows protesters entering Eddie Merlot's amid protests Friday night. May 29, 2020 Louisville Courier Journal On Fourth Street, according to Courier Journal reporter Sarah Ladd, several stores’ windows and glass doors were shattered. A large bush burned at the bottom of the Fifth Third Bank building. Hard Rock Cafe's alarm rang as shattered glass spilled into the road. • 11:15 p.m. – WAVE 3 representatives declined to comment in the immediate aftermath of an incident in which it appeared a police officer shot what looked like pepper balls from a gun at a reporter and camera operator. The Courier Journal's Tessa Duvall reached out to the station and to Louisville police in following the incident, which aired live on TV and immediately went viral. Jessie Halladay, a spokeswoman for LMPD, said at 11:30 p.m. Friday that she had reviewed the video and said it was too difficult to tell who the officer was at this time. Halladay apologized, and said, it's ""not our intention to target or subject the media as they try to cover this."" Check out the full story, with the video, here. • 11:05 p.m. – A group of protesters were working their way down Bardstown Road just after 11 p.m. amid a busy night in Louisville. The crowd appeared to be largely peaceful, as police lined the streets and a helicopter took to the air above them. Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin said the protesters at Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue were young. They lined down the street toward the Speedway at the Grinstead Road intersection. • 11 p.m. – Fireworks were set off at the corner of Sixth and Jefferson streets moments earlier, and protests a block away at Sixth and Market had left a mark. Garbage cans that had been set on fire had melted into the street, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth. A Subway and Republic Bank were vandalized, and protesters and drivers confronted one another at various points. The site hasn't hosted especially large crowds for much of the night but had seen plenty of action. A line of police, though, moved around 11 p.m. from Metro Hall toward Sixth Street. They left the scene at Sixth and Market without issue, Krauth said. On Jefferson Street at about 11 p.m., teenagers and young people walked toward advancing police in riot gear who had previously deployed tear gas, and the police then halted their advance as the situation appeared to hit a standstill. Protesters unfurled a banner that said ""This will not continue."" • 10:40 p.m. – No shots have been fired at Friday night's protest, LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay told The Courier Journal at 10:35 p.m., and no significant injuries have been reported. Two arrests have taken place. • 10:30 p.m. – In front of Metro Hall, police appear to have made an effort to split up groups of protesters. Courier Journal reporter Mandy McLaren was at the scene for an hour and reported at least 100 people were in front of the building, the site of Thursday night's confrontation, at 10:30 p.m., with officers lined shoulder-to-shoulder near Fifth and Jefferson streets to prevent two separate groups of protesters (one of at least 50 people in front of the Chase Bank, the other closer to Metro Hall) from joining together. Tear gas was dispersed minutes later, at 10:40 p.m. Tensions arose earlier in front of the Hall of Justice around sundown before that crowd moved toward Metro Hall after being dispersed by officers. • 9:45 p.m. – A lively but peaceful evening was interrupted at sundown as police shoulder-to-shoulder in riot gear with face shields, gas masks, batons and other protective gear moved protesters down Jefferson Street toward Sixth Street. The police unit rolled up just before 9:30 p.m., a half-hour after protesters at the Hall of Justice pulled down American and Kentucky flags and set them ablaze. Moments later, some protesters threw objects at the building's glass doors, more items were lit on fire and three loud bangs went off. A group of more than 1,000 people were estimated to be gathering around the Hall of Justice where everything seems to be focused. Earlier coverage from Friday Groups of protesters demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, who was an African American woman killed in her apartment by police officers on March 13, gathered in downtown Louisville. Earlier in the day, the group which was more than 500 gathered at Jefferson Street with two helicopters circling overhead, including a LMPD chopper. The groups had speakers talking from the steps of Metro Hall. The crowd has continued to grow as the evening demonstrations carried on. Hundreds also knelt between Broadway and Jefferson Street with their fists are in the air and marched around the police department chanting, 'No justice no peace.' At least one protester was against banging on the glass of the Hall of Justice steps. Protesters were also seen banging on glass at Hall of Justice steps calling for officers to come outside.

LMPD arrested and charged an Owensboro resident, 25-year-old Adair Henderson, with disorderly conduct and failure to disperse, according to an arrest citation. The offense of first-degree disorderly conduct is a Class A misdemeanor in Kentucky that is punishable by 90 days to one year in jail and a maximum $500 fine. Failure to to disperse is a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a maximum $250 fine. Stephanie Garvin and David Wheatley, both of Louisville, were also booked into Metro Corrections about 2 a.m. Friday and each charged with first-degree criminal mischief and first-degree riot, court records show. Garvin, 28, was seen by officers and captured on surveillance footage busting out the windows of a Metro Corrections van and throwing objects at the Metro Corrections building, according to her arrest citation. Wheatley, 27, was also seen breaking out the window of a Metro Corrections van and busting a window on the side of the Metro Corrections building, according to his citation. The charges of first-degree riot and first-degree criminal mischief are both Class D felonies in Kentucky, which are punishable by one to five years in prison. Louisville mayor: No-knock warrants will be suspended Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said Friday morning that five of the shooting victims from the protest are in ""good condition"" and that the two victims who required surgery are now ""stable and recovering."" The mayor also said that he is suspending the use of no-knock warrants by police and that all officers will now be required to wear body cameras while executing search warrants. Fischer said the gunfire that wounded seven people ""came from within the crowd, not from officers."" LMPD Assistant Chief of Police LaVita Chavous said LMPD has ""no leads on the shooter"" but is continuing to investigate. Two LMPD officers were also taken to the hospital with chest pains ""spurred"" by the protest, Chavous said, with one officer remaining in the hospital overnight before getting released. 'It is not a riot. It is a revolt': Councilwoman responds to Breonna Taylor protest The mayor mentioned damage to vehicles and statues. Protesters tore off the right hand of the King Louis XVI statue that stands on a pedestal at Sixth and Jefferson streets. After shots were fired in the crowd, officers deployed tear gas, pepper ball and smoke grenades ""after several verbal warnings were given ordering people to disperse,"" Washington said. ""Contrary to what you may have heard, LMPD does not utilize rubber bullets,"" Washington added. ""Pepper balls are similar to paint balls and often time leave welts on a person’s body after being struck."" Chavous would not disclose how many officers were on hand for Thursday's protest. When and where did the Thursday protest start? The gathering began as early as 6 or 7 p.m. and stretched past midnight. Crowds moved from outside City Hall on Sixth Street to in front of the KFC Yum Center, where more police officers began to engage with the crowd. As heavy rains moved into the area in the early morning hours, much of the crowd dispersed. How many protesters were there? An estimated 500 to 600 protesters gathered in the streets of downtown Louisville. The initially peaceful protest escalated as the night drew on, with the crowd being teargassed and glass storefronts shattered. By 10 p.m., at least one group could be seen verbally clashing with police officers near the Yum Center. The officers carried wooden batons and were wearing body armor and face shields. An armored truck was stationed nearby. It is unknown how many officers were called in to the protest. At one point, protesters threw things at police officers and kicked a patrol car. When one officer was surrounded by protesters near Bearno's by the Bridge, a pizza parlor near the Second Street bridge and the Yum Center, protest organizers stepped in to make sure the officer was not harmed.

May 28, 2020 (Photo: Pat McDonogh / Courier Journal) Around 11 p.m., a line of officers advanced down East Main Street, dispersing a large crowd. But not long after, hundreds congregated a few blocks south again in front of Metro Hall, where a group of protesters had been trying to tip an armored vehicle, breaking its windows and slashing its tires. Just before 11:30 p.m., multiple rounds of gunfire then rang out near Sixth and Jefferson streets. At least seven wounded victims were seen being carried away on stretchers. LMPD later confirmed that seven people had been shot and two required surgery. Who fired the shots? Who was arrested? LMPD said its officers did not fire their guns. As Chavous noted Friday morning, LMPD has ""no leads on the shooter,"" but the department's homicide unit is continuing to investigate. Apart from the Owensboro resident charged with disorderly conduct, police said several individuals were booked into Louisville Metro Corrections, with jail records indicating charges of first-degree riot and first-degree criminal mischief. Louisville mayor: 'Answering violence with violence' not the answer to Taylor death Why was there a protest? The death of Taylor, who was fatally shot March 13 by LMPD officers in her southwest Louisville apartment, was the main issue on the minds of protesters. Taylor's case has gained national and international attention in recent weeks as more information came to light on how police forced their way into her apartment as part of a narcotics investigation. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he and Taylor were scared and unsure of who was trying to gain entry to the apartment that night, while the officers have claimed they announced themselves several times. After officers used a battering ram to force their way into the apartment on Springfield Drive, Walker fired one shot that he says was in self-defense before the three officers responded with a hail of bullets, hitting Taylor eight times. No drugs were found inside Taylor's apartment. The FBI and Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron have since announced separate reviews of Taylor's death and the actions of the LMPD officers. Was the protest also about George Floyd? As mentioned, protesters focused mainly on calling for justice in Taylor's death. But the protests in Louisville unfurled as other cities saw similar demonstrations over police killings of black Americans, including in Phoenix, Denver and Minneapolis, where a man named George Floyd died after a white officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck. Floyd's death this week was captured on camera. That footage, coupled with how a transcript of a 911 call revealed that a clerk had accused Floyd of buying cigarettes with fake money, ignited protests around the country. Ben Crump, the Florida-based attorney representing Taylor's family, appeared Friday morning on MSNBC and called the recent, high-profile killings of black Americans “a national pandemic that’s affecting all African Americans.” “It is a state of emergency,” he said. What did Taylor's family and others say? As the situation in downtown Louisville escalated, Taylor's family took to social media to plead for peace. ""We are not going to stop until we get justice,"" Juniyah Palmer, Taylor's younger sister, said in a video. ""But we should stop tonight before people get hurt."" And during a Friday appearance on CNN, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read a statement from Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer: ""Breonna devoted her own life to saving other lives, to helping others, to making people smile, and to bringing people together. The last thing she’d want right now is any more violence. Changes are being made, but it’s not enough. We will not stop until there is truth, justice and accountability. Breonna’s legacy will not be forgotten. And it’s because of all of us saying her name and demanding justice. We are saying her name more each day. Thank you. Please keep saying her name. Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let’s do it the right way without hurting each other. We can, and we will make some real change here. Now’s the time. Let’s make it happen."" How many protesters were there Thursday? An estimated 500 to 600 protesters gathered in the streets of downtown Louisville for several hours. The gathering began as early as 6 or 7 p.m. and stretched past midnight. Where did it take place Thursday? Crowds moved from outside City Hall on Sixth Street to in front of the KFC Yum Center, where more police officers began to engage with the crowd. This story will be updated.

Louisville Courier Journal When Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey looked at the hundreds gathering Thursday night in downtown Louisville, she saw a city that was hurt. ""It is not a riot. It is a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed,"" said Dorsey, D-3rd District, who represents Shively and part of western Louisville. ""What I'm seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration."" The protest, which went on for hours in downtown Louisville, was filled with calls of ""No justice, no peace"" and demands to fire the officers involved in the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Louisville ER tech. At least seven people where shot Thursday night, according to police. Dorsey's comments were made prior to the shooting. It came on the heels of protests in other cities, including Minneapolis, where an unarmed black man was killed by police who kneeled on his neck. ""What they're saying is we're tired. We want real change. We want substantive change,"" Dorsey said. ""For a long time, we've used evidence-based approaches to find the problem. Now we know what the problem is, and we want to see action."" Louisville mayor: 'Answering violence with violence' not the answer to Breonna Taylor death What we know: Breonna Taylor protest in downtown Louisville draws hundreds Louisville's protest, one of the first mass gatherings since Taylor's death in March, began shortly after the 911 call made by Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, was made public on Thursday afternoon by Taylor's family's attorney and, later, Mayor Greg Fischer. What the call contained, Dorsey said, was a reflection of anyone in fear — contrary to his previous portrayal, she said. Walker had faced criminal charges of attempted murder of a police officer from the night Taylor was shot and killed, after he fired a shot and struck an officer in the leg. Walker maintained it was a warning shot and he didn't know it was police who were entering the apartment. His charges were dismissed by the commonwealth's attorney last week. ""The portrayal of this man, who was presented in one light, we're seeing something very different,"" said Dorsey. ""Humanity was revealed in that call."" And now, she said, people are trying to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration.

(Photo: Brian Bohannon, Brian Bohannon/Special to Courier Journal) ""What people are saying is this can't continue to happen,"" Dorsey said. ""Breonna Taylor and Kenneth Walker brought to the spotlight what many have been experiencing for a long time."" The protest turned more violent as the night moved on, with at least one report of shots fired in the crowd. But Dorsey said Thursday that the protesters marching in solidarity, with one unified voice, was an attempt to say, ""We will no longer accept this."" ""To me, that march is not an ask. It's a demand for change. What we're seeing tonight is people demand change,"" she said. Hear the 911 call: 'Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend' This story may be updated.

Dorsey, D-3rd District, represents Shively and part of western Louisville. Who was Breonna Taylor? What we know about the Louisville ER tech Also: Breonna Taylor protest in downtown Louisville draws hundreds. Here's what we know In what began as a peaceful demonstration, an estimated 500 to 600 people marched through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of paintballs at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. Protesters tore off the right hand of the King Louis XVI statue that stands on a pedestal at Sixth and Jefferson streets. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer responded to the unrest shortly before midnight, posting on Twitter, ""Understandably, emotions are high,"" along with a statement posted earlier in the evening from Taylor's family. That statement, attributed to Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, thanked protesters for ""giving Bre a voice tonight,"" while also asking crowds to ""keep it peaceful."" Fischer's tweet concluded: ""As Breonna’s mother says, let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice."" Hear from our reporter from the scene: Courier Journal's Cameron Teague Robinson shares what he saw at Breonna Taylor protest Protesters flooded downtown just hours after The Courier Journal obtained and reported Thursday afternoon the 911 call made in the immediate aftermath of Taylor's death. The 26-year-old EMT died in the hall of her apartment after police officers executed a ""no-knock"" search warrant in the early morning hours of March 13 as part of a narcotics investigation. She was struck by at least eight bullets. Throughout the evening, many protesters could be seen holding both hands in the air, as if to show they were unarmed. ""We came for peace,"" one man said over a bullhorn. Most of those gathered appeared to be wearing face masks. Rally organizers led chants. Signs were held high. One read, ""Who do you call when police murder?"" What we know: Breonna Taylor protest in downtown Louisville draws hundreds Early on, large crowds chanted, ""No justice! No peace! Prosecute the police!"" Protesters, many of them white, linked arms, forming a wall across Sixth Street between Louisville City and Metro halls. One held a sign that read, ""Until all police states burn we fight for black lives."" “Say her name!” yelled Chanelle Helm, a leader for Black Lives Matter Louisville. “Breonna!” the crowd called in return. By 10 p.m., at least one group could be seen verbally clashing with police officers near the Yum Center. The officers carried wooden batons and were wearing body armor and face shields. An armored truck was stationed nearby. ""Good cops need to start speaking up and standing up!"" one man yelled. “My son is 13 and is scared to walk down the street!"" shouted a woman. ""Please avoid the area until further notice!"" a Twitter post from Louisville Metro Police said. 911 call from shooting: 'Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend' At one point, protesters threw things at police officers and kicked a patrol car. When one officer was surrounded by protesters near Bearno's by the Bridge, a pizza parlor near the Second Street bridge and the Yum Center, protest organizers stepped in to make sure the officer was not harmed.

The protest organizers surrounded the officer and joined arms to make sure that the crowed did not touch him. (Photo: Michael Clevenger/Courier Journal) Around 11 p.m., a line of officers advanced down East Main Street, dispersing a large crowd. But not long after, hundreds congregated in front of Metro Hall, where a group of protesters had been trying to tip an armored vehicle, breaking its windows and slashing its tires. Multiple rounds of gunfire then rang out. At least seven injured people, their wounds seeping blood, were seen being carried away on stretchers. Read more: What to know about the investigations into the shooting of Taylor Protesters in recent days have demanded that officers involved in Taylor's death — identified by the department as Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly and officers Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove — be fired. They've also called for a ban on no-knock warrants. No drugs were recovered from Taylor's home. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired his weapon and struck a police officer in the femoral artery as they entered the apartment, and Taylor was struck in the ensuing gunfire. In the 911 call, Walker can be heard crying out Taylor's name and calling for help as he tries to speak to a dispatcher. ""I don't know what is happening,"" said Walker, 27. ""Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend."" Her death has sparked questions from activists and family members about what led to the fatal shooting and drastically increased pressure on local officials in recent weeks. Police Chief Steve Conrad announced last week he would retire at the end of June, and Fischer has said he's turned over findings of an internal police investigation to the U.S. Attorney's Office and FBI. The FBI has also opened its own independent investigation. The Courier Journal late Tuesday sued the city's police department for records related to the investigation after officials refused to turn them over. Bernard Bradberry, 44, came to the protest with his 16-year-old son, A.J. Hall. ""We want justice,"" said A.J., who pushed his father along the downtown streets in a wheelchair. Bradberry said many African Americans in Louisville are angered by more than just Taylor's death. “Because of all the other violence going on in the country, too,"" he said. ""All of it’s been led up to this."" The Louisville protests come less than a day after unrest erupted in Minneapolis in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. Protests in Minneapolis continued Thursday night, with large crowds also rallying in Phoenix, Denver and Columbus, Ohio. Read more: 'It is not a riot. It is a revolt': Councilwoman responds to protest In downtown Louisville, Bradberry called what he and others see as a lack of police accountability ""a slap in the face."" ""It’s like, do they even feel sorry for what they’ve done?"" he asked. Courtney Artis, of Jeffersontown, said she attended the protest because she was “tired of police.” “It’s not right that they keep killing black people,” she said. “My parents are from Birmingham, Alabama, and I’m tired of them repeating history. We’ve been peaceful too long, so that’s why we’re out here.” Artis said she hoped the protest would pressure officials to charge the officers involved in Taylor’s death. “They need to go to jail like anybody else would,” she said. “If I killed somebody, I would get held accountable, right? Right. So, I want them to be held accountable also.” USA TODAY contributed to this report.

While the situation is still unfolding, we know that were several hours of peaceful protest before some in the crowd turned violent, leading to seven people being people shot from within the crowd. Five are in good condition; two were sent to surgery. My prayers are with all of them. No officers fired their weapons, and my thanks go to the police officers who, despite risk to themselves, got aid to those injured. I feel the community’s frustration, the anger, the fear.

Gunfire and vandalism does not advance our cause – and it cannot be tolerated. I support protesters’ First Amendment rights to share their frustrations, in a peaceful manner.

The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn't provide a number.“No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians.The protests stretched for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down.“Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor's mother. “As Breonna's mother says let's be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice.”Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.Attention on Taylor's death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February.Thursday's demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody.Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor's family.“Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna's name tonight.

Some shots were heard on scene just before 11:30 p.m., and a police spokeswoman confirmed the injuries at 1 a.m. in a statement. Two victims required surgery.

What started as a peaceful protest in the evening escalated as the night drew on, with the crowd being teargassed and glass storefronts shattered. As heavy rains moved into the area in the early morning hours, much of the crowd dispersed. The protests in Louisville unfurled as other cities saw similar demonstrations over police killings of black Americans. Unrest unfolded Thursday night in Phoenix, Denver and Minneapolis, where a man named George Floyd died this week after an officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck. Floyd's death was captured on camera, igniting a reaction across the nation. Journalists arrested during protest:CNN's Omar Jimenez and crew arrested, released while covering protests over George Floyd death Taylor was shot and killed by several Louisville police officers in March who were serving a no-knock warrant as part of a narcotics investigation, though police have since claimed that they knocked and announced themselves before entering Taylor's apartment that night. On Friday, the mayor said he is suspending the use of no-knock warrants by police. As the situation in downtown Louisville escalated Thursday night, Taylor's family took to social media to plead for peace. ""We are not going to stop until we get justice,"" Juniyah Palmer, Taylor's younger sister, said in a video. ""But we should stop tonight before people get hurt."" Jessie Halladay, a spokeswoman for LMPD, briefly addressed the media via video chat, saying: ""This is not what we want for our city.""

There were reports of tear gas being used, though Halladay was not able to confirm that during her appearance. ""Our goal all evening has been to try to allow a peaceful demonstration,"" Halladay said. ""I think we were doing that quite successfully.

That was quite a scene of what you've just endured for the past hour. Can you tell us what happened? Well, we saw a lot of it play out on TV there. There seemed to be a little bit of confusion as to what what was supposed to or what was allowed to happen. Now, well, as we're reporting, we had been in verbal contact. At least it seemed, with some of the police officers saying, All right, where can we be? We have heard we played some of it as they were giving out commands for people to clear the area. And we saw that as protesters completely cleared out. And that, of course, came after there was an hour and 1/2. Or at least where we're standing, where there was no sort of police presence. So as people came down, we saw them walking down the block, and whether repress or not, we wanted to make sure we were out of the way. So you so we basically stepped onto the corner is where we were. And I think the moment before the arrest actually happened was we saw at least 11 protester or Allison, who was not media sort of run past us. And that person was cornered by State Patrol was the main unit that seemed to be there. And after that person was apprehended, they then turned toward us now, and that was the first moment I could say that police had gotten behind us. So in a sense, we were sort of surrounded by state patrolman, and it seemed like Minneapolis police officers as well. But again, it was that moment where all of a sudden someone runs past and there are already on edge based on the absolute destruction that's all around them. And that arrests happened just right in front of the Minneapolis Third Precinct. That, of course, went up in flames last night. Omar, I'm not sure you know this, but our cameras were not only rolling the whole time you were taken into custody, but the cameras continue to roll. Frankly, for the entire ride to the precinct, we could see the picture for the whole time. First of all, let me also say, Omar, what an amazing job you did throughout that your composure and your ability to keep your cool is a testament to your professionalism. Um, which we already knew about by how great of a job you're doing covering the story on the streets there. You and your team did a terrific job. Now what we did not hear, even though we saw the transportation, is from the moment you were lead away until the moment you were just released. So can you please tell us what took place while you were in custody? Well, everyone to their credit, was pretty cordial after that happened. So it seemed I was actually talking to the officer that was leading me away. I was like, And then we're gonna be out here for the next few days. What is the guidance of where we should be? If you don't want us that close, where should we? Because we're under the impression that that was OK. And he said, Look, I don't know, man. I'm just following orders, so I don't know who is potentially giving that order in that particular moment. But as far as the people that were leading me away, they there was no animosity there. They weren't they weren't violent with me. We're having conversation about just how crazy this week has been for every single part of the city. And like I mentioned, a lot of these people are on edge. And as we were walking by, we saw a person on the edge of sort of the perimeter that they had formed. And this wasn't a protester. This was just a a random it seemed citizen, who was saying, Hey, I need to get back into my place over there. And where were you when this neighborhood? Completely about the short. I mean, we saw where they were. They were in the middle of what became a focal point of anger, passion, violence, even at times and there they were forced to retreat. And then this morning, literally within a matter of minutes, we saw all of them swarm back in clearing out these protesters from the city level. That's we saw the fire department and Police Department come in. And then the State Patrol was advancing as we're seeing up that street toward our location. Now, where we were standing basically to my right, was where all the protesters were outside or in front of the the building that was on fire and into our left was where they were advancing. So we were basically just going to try and step back and let them continue to advance down the street. But again, you saw what unfolded there. But as far as what happened in between again, they were They were pretty cordial. Once we're in the trucks as well. They were were downtown. Obviously, this is the Hennepin County Public Safety Building here. They're all pretty pretty good with us. Onda conversation. Well, that's a relief, Omar, because you could not have been more professional. You were doing your job by the book. You presented your credentials. You told them that you were a journalist. You told them that you were within and you told them you were. They were. You were live on the air. I mean, you did them the courtesy of explaining that we were live on the air at that moment. And I'm just wondering, after you and your crew were arrested, at what point did they? I mean, did they ever say sorry, that was a mistake. Or when they released you, Was there an explanation of that? That had all been a big misunderstanding or mistake and you're allowed to report there. That conversation may have happened above some of the people that were with for us. It was literally a situation off. Tell me who you are. Me as far as identification purposes than they left. And they came back and said, You're with CNN, Correct? Yes. And then we explained that to other team members that were with me on three, including the security that we that we had hired for this. And then they left, came back and then let us out of the van, were inside the van, handcuffed the whole time. And then we were sat down, waited for a little bit more, and then from there, that was when they eventually came back with our with our belongings that they confiscated. Over the course of this, they had they unclipped our handcuffs. And then that is when we were let out. And again, it's answer your question. There was no sort of sorry. This is a big misunderstanding, blah, blah, blah, because it seems that conversation may have happened. But it didn't happen with us in particular, but also is the difference of jurisdiction. Just just one more question because it was It was a nerve racking moment for all of us watching. You know, Bakari Sellers just described watching it and saying that it was really emotional and heart pumping for him because he was scared for you and other people watching. Given the backdrop of everything that's happening in Minneapolis, he was scared for you at this moment when you were being taken into custody. You know, I should also let you know that Josh Campbell, who was reporting a block or two away from you, was not taken into custody. He was treated quite politely. Were you scared when this was happening? And do you have any idea why you were arrested and not Josh Kim? Well, there was a moment, I would say, minutes after it happened, where things started to sink in a little bit. I think I don't have to tell you Alison or John that sometimes when you're in this job in these scenarios, there's a lot of adrenaline pumping. You're trying to focus and balance so many different factors. In a case like this, I'm tryingto balance what the actual story is, how the story line is advancing while also trying to be aware of our surroundings, which at times can get dangerous. So there's that mentality, and then the arrest happened. I was still trying to communicate with you all as this was going on, because I was just confused as you. We have been showing our credentials throughout this entire week, and especially in the moments leading up to that. So I couldn't really understand what was going on. But as we were walking away and you're sort of taking in the entire neighborhood that had been completely decimated again from the passion of the protesters and unfortunately, some of the rioting and looting that we had seen. It did cross my mind that what is really happening here, and the one thing that gave me a little bit of comfort was that it happened on live TV. There has been this When you talk within the community about, let's just say what's happened with George Floyd. There's always a discussion that what's happening isn't new. It's being filmed, and that speaks to the power of having something happen on camera because you can have people speak up for you without you saying anything. And that gave me a little bit of comfort knowing that you guys saw what was happening. I was living what was happening, and the country was seeing what was happening unfold in real time, right before their eyes. You don't have to doubt my story. It's not filtered in any sort of way. You saw it for your own eyes, and that gave me a little bit of comfort, but it definitely was nerve racking a certain point.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

The estimated crowd of 400, angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, had a standoff with Columbus police officers, blocking the intersection of Broad and High streets for nearly three hours Thursday night. When protesters were dispersed with pepper spray around 11:20 p.m., some broke windows as they fled along South High Street and overturned trash cans on the front Statehouse lawn. Protesters in Columbus on Thursday night, calling attention to the killing on Goerge Floyd in Minneapolis. (Photo: Jim Woods/Columbus Dispatch) There were reports of windows broken all the way to the area of the Franklin County Courthouse in the 300 block of South High Street. The DGX store, a subsidiary of Dollar General, at 166 S. High Street, was broken into and looted. There was even the report a brief fire set at the CAPA ticket office and reports of objects being thrown at the federal courthouse on Marconi Boulevard. Around midnight, more Columbus police officers and Ohio State Highway troopers were called to the Downtown to help. The protest was frequently testy as some in the crowd hurled plastic bottles full of water at police officers, who at times would respond with volleys of pepper spray. There were even a few times that flares and smoke bombs were thrown at officers. Officers were struck by plastic bottles on at least a couple of occasions. In Louisville: Breonna Taylor protest draws hundreds; at least 7 shot. Here's what we know After the protesters would run from the pepper spray, they would again push back toward a line of officers. The crowd was relentless. A line of police officers, reinforced by the mounted unit and some cruisers, held the line on North High Street, just north of Broad Street starting at around 8:30 p.m. when the standoff began. Columbus police could not say how many arrests have been made. There was a report around 12:30 a.m. of an injured person in front of the Doubletree Suites on Front Street. Mayor Andrew Ginther tweeted: “I understand why some residents are angry and taking to the streets. I have said many times that racism exists across the country, state and right here in Columbus. We are committed to addressing racism wherever we see it. I understand why some residents are angry and taking to the streets. I have said many times that racism exists across the country, state and right here in Columbus. We are committed to addressing racism wherever we see it. — Mayor Andrew Ginther (@MayorGinther) May 29, 2020 “I respect peaceful protests,” he continued, “and ask residents to remain peaceful in their actions tonight and every night.” The protest started peacefully earlier Thursday night. Around 8 p.m. participants went from marching around the Ohio Statehouse to assembling in the middle of the intersection at Broad and High streets to call attention to the death Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody. The crowd assembled at Broad and High at around 8:30 p.m. More: Trump on violent Minneapolis protests: 'thugs' dishonor George Floyd's memory, Twitter labels tweet as 'glorifying violence' Alternately chanting slogans like “No Justice No Peace”, “Black Lives Matter” and “I can’t breathe”, the protesters were expressing outrage over the death Monday of Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who pleaded for air while a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes as other officers put him in custody. Many carried homemade signs which said things like “We Stand with Minneapolis” and “Do Not Stay Silent.” Floyd became unconscious and was later pronounced dead at a hospital. All four officers were fired after video of the incident went viral and there have been calls for murder and other charges against them. Investigations into the death are underway. The official cause of Floyd’s death has not yet been determined as the county medical examiner there awaits laboratory results to complete an autopsy. A Columbus police helicopter hovered overhead at Broad and High streets early on around dusk as the protesters began gathering in the middle of the intersection. Police on the ground gave periodic warnings to the protesters that they had to disperse from the intersection and roadway or face arrest. Despite some protesters without masks shouting at police in riot gear and facial shields, police did not act on those threats for more than an hour and a half. After some full plastic water bottles and a few smoke bombs were tossed at police by a small number of protesters, police warned they would deploy pepper spray and eventually did so. Some in the crowd told those who were throwing bottles not to do so. A second, larger volley of pepper spray was deployed about 10 p.m. Much of the crowd dispersed but a core group remained in the intersection and they were rejoined by some of those who had fled earlier. Shortly after 11 p.m., with some local TV stations going live from the scene on their newscasts, some protesters again threw full water bottles at police. Officers responded with blasts of pepper spray. Participants said they heard about the protest through social media. “I didn’t know there was any way I could stay home. I had to come out and express my anger,” said Ashique Mohammad, 28, who said he learned of the protest through social media. A 28-year-old man named Noah, who would not give his last name, was wearing goggles as he was standing near the area where protesters were in a standoff with a line of police officers. “I hope I don’t need them,” Noah said about his protective eye equipment. He said he lives outside Columbus and heard about the protest from a couple of friends. Josh Mondesir, 22, lives in the LeVeque Tower and happened to see the protesters massing down the street from his residence. “As one person, you can’t do much but as a group, you might make a difference,” Mondesir said. Bryan Battle, 21, of Columbus, was shooting video of the protest from the sidewalk. At one point, Battle recorded a Columbus police officer pushing back a protester who was taunting him in the face. Another officer then ran to help and deployed pepper spray. Battle said at one point an officer sprayed him in the face while he was videoing the incident, which included an officer taking a person down to the ground. Melissa Thrweatt, 53, said she didn’t agree with how the protesters were conducting themselves. “I think the way to get your point across is to respect yourself and respect others,” Thrweatt said. However, Thrweatt said it is right to protest because it was wrong how the Minneapolis police officer treated Floyd and caused his death by kneeling on his throat. A second, smaller protest was also reported Thursday night at Livingston and Lockbourne avenues on the South Side. Similar protests have been held around the country in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Denver and other cities as protesters demand justice in Floyd’s death. Some rioting and looting have occurred in the Minneapolis area and at least one auto parts store was set afire. The governor of Minnesota called out the National Guard for assistance in response to violent protesting there for a third straight night. The city’s third precinct police station was ordered evacuated after protesters overran the building. In Denver, a vehicle reportedly ran into a protester blocking a roadway as part of a protest there. Meanwhile, there are calls by Black Lives Matter and others on social media for a #BlackOutDay2020 on July 7 in which blacks and other people of color speak out against the Floyd situation and racism in general with their wallets. To show how important blacks and other people of color are to the economy, they are being asked to not spend any money that day.

1620034665,2020-05-29 06:13:00,Cliven Bundy Armed Standoff Case Going Back To Court,https://www.wkyufm.org/post/cliven-bundy-armed-standoff-case-going-back-court,en,False,,35248,wkyufm.org,http://wkyufm.org#spider,"It's been more than two years since Cliven Bundy left the federal courthouse in downtown Las Vegas a free man. His arm around his wife, Carol Bundy, the Nevada rancher was defiant. ""We're not done with this,"" Bundy told reporters in January 2018. ""If the federal government comes after us again we will definitely tell 'em the truth."" On Friday, the Justice Department will try to come after the Bundys again, when federal prosecutors will appeal for a retrial over a 2014 armed standoff between Bundy, his militia and federal agents who had come to round up the rancher's cows that were illegally grazing on federal land. The government's case against Cliven Bundy, his sons, Ammon and Ryan and a Montana militiaman named Ryan Payne, collapsed after a judge declared a mistrial in December 2017. Bundy and his men were accused of conspiracy against federal agents and other charges for their role in the tense standoff which later became a symbol over the fight against federal control of public lands. ""If there is no successful prosecution, it's going to encourage a lot of anarchists like the Bundys to take actions that not only are a threat to themselves but threats to the public at large,"" said Pat Shea, who served as BLM director during the Clinton administration. Retrial effort criticized For their part, the Bundys and their supporters appear puzzled that the federal government is even pursuing a retrial. ""What's really ironic and frankly I think disgusting is that the Trump Justice Department is the one that allowed the U.S. attorney in Nevada to take the appeal,"" said Larry Klayman, Cliven Bundy's attorney. After all, President Trump recently pardoned two Oregon ranchers whose fight with federal land managers inspired Cliven Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, to lead a separate, armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016. Federal prosecutors mostly failed to get convictions in that Oregon case and have been widely criticized for bungling the Nevada trial. Judge Gloria Navarro dismissed the case and later declared a mistrial after ruling federal prosecutors ""deliberately misled"" defense attorneys and the court by failing to provide evidence from surveillance cameras and to disclose the existence of federal snipers near the ranch in the days leading up to the April 2014 standoff. The U.S. attorney's office in Nevada declined an interview request by NPR. But court filings indicate prosecutors will likely argue Friday that their missteps in the 2017 trial were ""inadvertent,"" and in particular they say they were trying to balance disclosing Bureau of Land Management surveillance footage with protecting witnesses against violence. Klayman, who is himself a controversial conservative activist and was once fixture in the ""Birther"" movement, says the DOJ is being hypocritical. He says the investigation against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was recently dropped, but not his clients. ""If you're one of the Washington elite and establishment in the nation's capital, you get special treatment,"" Klayman said. ""If you're Cliven Bundy and his sons and the peaceful protesters, basically you don't."" Most of the federal agents and land managers who were at the 2014 standoff say it was anything but a peaceful protest. Photos and social media posts showed militia training their rifles on armed BLM officers who had come to round up Bundy's cattle. Cliven Bundy has refused to recognize the federal government's ownership of millions of acres of public land — including in Nevada. The rancher has consequently not paid federal fees owed for grazing his cows on land near the Lake Mead National Recreation Area since the 1990s. Pandemic ""resuscitates"" movement Retired federal land managers like Pat Shea have expressed outrage over the government's continued failure to prosecute the Bundys, whose cows continue to graze — for free — on land that's now protected as a national monument. The Bundys' original dispute over grazing goes back decades, stemming from tensions between ranchers and environmentalists and the city of Las Vegas, as it began rapidly expanding into a protected desert tortoise's habitat. Bundy was seen as the last rancher in southern Nevada who refused to get out of the business. But in the years since, his critics say the family's fight has devolved into far right extremism, and a widely debunked legal theory that counties and states, not the federal government, should own public land. ""It's like the COVID-19 virus, they mutate as to their belief system so much that you can never tell what they're going to advocate,"" Shea said. ""They are a danger to themselves and a danger to everyone else they come in contact with."" Indeed, the pandemic has lately brought an opportunity to breathe new life to the Bundys and their self-described patriot movement that had been seen as starting to fade. Ammon Bundy and some of the family's followers have been traveling across the West leading protests against coronavirus public health restrictions, protests that thus far haven't drawn huge numbers. At one recent march in Washington state that was streamed on Facebook, activist Kelli Stewart decried the business closures: ""Come on guys, this is the American way, open rebellion to tyrannical laws, we're not slaves."" A rebellious fight against tyranny, or justice against a family that has flaunted the law for decades, that's a question now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The court takes up the appeal for a retrial in USA vs. Bundy in a virtual session on Friday. ",0.0

Though the protest was initially peaceful, the crowd grew tenser as the evening went on. Shortly after 11:30 p.m., shots were fired and police later reported seven civilians in the crowd had been injured, one critically. The origins of the shots are unknown, but a Louisville Metro Police spokeswoman said no police officers fired their weapons. By the end of the evening, property damage was reported on several different downtown streets. Protesters damaged the statue of King Louis XVI outside Metro Hall and slashed vehicle tires. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets. And both the family of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment by LMPD officers in March, and Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer called for peace.

There were also protests in several other places, including New York. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) No justice, no peace. No justice, no peace. MARTIN: And in Louisville, Ky., at least seven people were shot. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) MARTIN: Hundreds packed downtown Louisville demanding justice for another life lost at the hands of police - Breonna Taylor. Taylor is the black woman who was shot by police back in March - police conducting a raid on her residence. Joining us now from Louisville, reporter Amina Elahi of member station WFPL. Amina, thanks for being with us. You were out in those protests last night. What did you see? AMINA ELAHI, BYLINE: We heard and saw a lot of amazing images and sounds. People gathered, at first, peacefully demanding justice, demanding accountability for the police officers who took Breonna Taylor's life. In addition, we saw people there with young children who wanted them to see why it's important to be aware of the risks of being African American in America. And we also saw some people who were causing trouble. You know, as you mentioned, seven people were shot. The police tell us that they were all civilians and that no police officers fired their weapons last night. The latest update we got from the mayor of Louisville, Greg Fischer, is that five of the seven people are in good condition and two of them have been sent to surgery, although we haven't gotten any more information on them yet this morning. MARTIN: Can you remind us about the circumstances of Breonna Taylor's death? ELAHI: Yes. Police officers entered Breonna Taylor's apartment after midnight on March 13 as part of a drug investigation. Breonna Taylor was not the main target of that investigation, but she had previously had a relationship with the person who was. The police say that they knocked and loudly announced themselves and gave her time to come to the door. But perhaps because it was late and she had been asleep, she wasn't able to make it to the door in the time that they were hoping, so they broke it down. By then, she and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who was there with her that night, were scared. And Kenneth Walker says that he fired a warning shot at the police because he thought some intruder was breaking in. The police fired back more than 20 shots and eight of them struck Breonna Taylor and killed her. MARTIN: So this, as we've noted, happened back in March. Protesters are still on the streets. Clearly, they feel like justice hasn't been served. Where does the case stand? ELAHI: The investigation into the case is still ongoing with the police. They have turned some results over to the state's attorney general who will be reviewing it, as well as to the FBI. But we learned from the FBI last week that they will be conducting their own investigation. You've also heard people on the national scale, such as Senator Kamala Harris, call for the Department of Justice to investigate. But so far, the public is still waiting to get the results of the police's internal investigation and to see what the FBI turns up. MARTIN: I mean, how have officials responded to all this? Has the police department made any changes? ELAHI: There have been some changes that have mainly come down from the mayor's office. He has instituted some greater controls on no-knock warrants such as requiring that they be signed off on by the chief of police before they're taken to a judge for approval; also attempting to expand when and how body cameras are used. And now, the city is looking into creating a civilian oversight board. There are a lot of questions about how much control that civilian review board might have - for example, whether it might have subpoena power. And they're actually having their first workgroup meeting today to figure out what the structure of that might be. But in terms of the major reforms or concerns that the public is asking for, we haven't seen much of that yet nor have any officials been willing to say that the arrest and firing of the officers involved in the shooting is a step that we can anticipate. MARTIN: All right, we'll see if protests continue into the weekend. WFPL's Amina Elahi in Louisville, thank you. ELAHI: Thank you. Copyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

1620084977,2020-05-29 05:58:08,Breonna Taylor shooting- What to know about Louisville protest,http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625458774/0/courierjournal/news~Breonna-Taylor-protest-in-downtown-Louisville-draws-hundreds-Heres-what-we-know/,en,False,,658822,State News - United States - Kentucky,http://www.kentucky.statenews.net/,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Sunday has not been a slow news day in the Bluegrass State. In the aftermath of a third night of protests that took place Saturday over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, several demonstrations have popped up across Louisville on Sunday, and city officials have released more information about what's taken place over the weekend. Here's what's happening around the city. • 10:45 p.m. — In a media briefing, Mayor Greg Fischer called for a ""day of reflection"" on Monday, as Sunday night protests began to taper off. Fischer said local faith leaders would have a virtual call on Facebook Live at 11:30 a.m. Monday to mourn those who have died in the coronavirus pandemic -- ""that's one of my worries about all these people being together,"" Fischer added. LMPD Lt. Colonel LaVita Chavous took the mic afterward and said more than 40 arrests have taken place after a peaceful protest earlier turned unlawful. She added that ""anarchists"" had ""infiltrated"" the crowd as well, and they were using the peaceful protest for their own purposes. Chavous said the peaceful protest at Jefferson Square Park was unlawful, as it took place without a permit, which led to officers breaking it up before curfew. The officer who fired pepper balls at a WAVE 3 crew on Friday, meanwhile, is being investigated and will be reassigned in the meantime, Chavous said. • 10:30 p.m. — Louisville police have addressed an allegation reported by WDRB from Metro Council President David James that protesters were fired upon because they were carrying leaf blowers with bleach to shoot at police. Six or so protesters were arrested minutes earlier near Broadway and Brook Street, while other arrests have taken place in the meantime. An estimated crowd of 1,000 had gathered earlier before sunset at Jefferson Square Park. That group split up, though, after being confronted by police. LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay, meanwhile, said while they had not confirmed protesters were carrying leaf blowers with the intent to harm police, they had seen demonstrators carrying them in the crowd. ""We saw people with leaf blowers in the crowd,"" Hallday told The Courier Journal's Sarah Ladd. ""We know those are used for things like dispensing powder chemicals and for blowing gas back toward police. We don’t have any confirmation they were used for either purpose. The threat of that use is one reason we decided to disperse the crowd prior to curfew."" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer will address media at 10:45 p.m. for a Sunday night update. • 10:15 p.m. — Police arrested around six demonstrators near Broadway and Brook Street. Louisville's curfew went into effect at 9 p.m., though police fired tear gas at protesters at Jefferson Square Park before that deadline. Last night, Mayor Greg Fischer said 40-50 people were arrested during the protests. • 9:45 p.m — Broadway was completely blocked at First Street just before 9:45 p.m. Protesters have been scattered around downtown since being split up from a meeting point at Jefferson Square Park at around 8:20 p.m. A large police presence has come to a standstill by the gas station at First Street, with a lot of police vehicles on and helicopters in the air. • 9:30 p.m — Jefferson Square Park is packed with law enforcement officials at sundown, and protesters on Broadway were met with pepper balls and tear gas, according to Courier Journal and USA TODAY reporters Darcy Costello and Natalie Alund. The crowd was heading toward the Highlands, where another large protest took place Saturday night. Tear gas is in the air, Costello said – you can feel it in your throat. Police are using vans to rapidly redeploy across the city to reach different groups of protesters. • 9 p.m — We've hit curfew in Louisville. About 1,000 protesters who rallied earlier in the evening split up after being confronted by police at around 8:15 p.m. A large police presence was by the Brown Hotel on Broadway at 9 p.m. cars honked and the sun continued to set. Car protests have been common throughout the weekend protests. • 8:45 p.m — Citing an anti-riot statute, police have taken steps early Sunday night to break up protests, even before the 9 p.m. curfew. Tear gas and flash bangs scattered crowds at Jefferson Square Park, according to Courier Journal reporter Darcy Costello, as some protesters dispersed toward Fourth Street, which has taken heavy damage amid three previous nights of demonstrations, and others spread to other pockets of downtown Louisville. Officers have cleared out Jefferson Square Park. pic.twitter.com/behNAcEglB — Darcy Costello (@dctello) June 1, 2020 Law enforcement members in full camo took their place on some downtown streets leading up to and during the confrontation. National Guard members had been called in by officials to assist after Friday's protests, while Kentucky State Police officers are also alongside Louisville Metro Police officers. • 8:20 p.m. — Protesters were told by a speaker with a megaphone to take children home just before 8 p.m., and 10 minutes later police announced that the demonstration was an ""unlawful assembly,"" though Louisville's curfew was not scheduled to begin until 9 p.m. The person with the megaphone told the crowd that tear gas and flash bangs would be fired, causing some to leave the scene. At 8:19 p.m., police followed through, firing flash bangs and tear gas into the crowd at Jefferson Square Park. • 7:45 p.m. — Protesters took to the street on Broadway and raised their fists as police officers looked on at around 7:30 p.m. Sunday, according to Courier Journal reporter Darcy Costello. The group, which numbered in the hundreds, knelt in front of Metro Corrections minutes later. The number of protesters is high Sunday night, those in the field say. Another group has gathered at Sixth and Liberty streets, where officers destroyed protesters' milk jugs and water bottles a night earlier. Meanwhile, a MetroSafe supervisor said one person was taken to the hospital with life-threatening injuries after having being shot at Seventh and Hill streets, according to Courier Journal reporter Sarah Ladd. It's unknown if the shooting is related to the protest. • 7 p.m. — By around 7 p.m, an estimated crowd of 1,000 had gathered on Broadway and Roy Wilkins, filling all six lanes of Roy Wilkins, to demand justice for Breonna Taylor. • 6 p.m. — Mayor Greg Fischer said Monday will be designated as a ""Day of Reflection"" to reflect on what needs to change to combat racism in the city. There will be a virtual gathering on Facebook Live at 11:30 a.m. The day will also honor the people from Louisville who have died from the coronavirus. Here's a quick look at what you may have missed earlier Sunday. • Around 40 people were arrested at Saturday night's protests, according to Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, as the National Guard was called in to assist. Saturday was the first day a 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. curfew was in effect — the curfew also applies Sunday night and will be reevaluated on Monday. • A number of maximum security inmates broke an interior dormitory window overnight at the jail, according to a Metro Corrections release, and they damaged some property in the jail before the disturbance was quelled. Four suffered minor injuries. None of the inmates involved were arrested at the weekend protests, the release said. • While volunteers downtown cleaned up, more demonstrations took place around town Sunday afternoon, including one notable gathering in St. Matthews and an address by local pastors at 13th Street and Broadway. • A police cruiser was hit by at least one bullet on Saturday night, Fischer said Sunday. The car was near Ninth and Broadway. Three officers were inside and no one was injured. From Saturday night A third night of protests erupted in Louisville on Saturday, with a heavier police presence taking to the streets to match the local demonstrators. The demonstrations are part of a national movement and in Louisville have taken place over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, an African American who was unarmed when police executed a ""no-knock"" search warrant at her apartment and returned fire when her boyfriend fired on them. He has said he thought they were intruders. Livestream: Third night of Breonna Taylor protests in Louisville. Watch the footage While much of what's occurred at the two protests has been peaceful, Thursday night's demonstration was marred by a shooting that injured seven people and Friday night saw looting and widespread damage throughout downtown as police fired tear gas at several groups. On Saturday, Mayor Greg Fischer and Gov. Andy Beshear called for the National Guard to assists in the city, and the added police presence was felt -- looting and major property damage did not appear to be an issue, though officers and protesters clashed throughout the night in the Highlands and downtown. The Courier Journal had reporters and photographers around the city to cover Saturday's protests in real time. Here's a look back at what happened. • 2 a.m. – A busy night across Louisville appeared to be slowing to a halt in the early hours of Sunday morning. Two people were injured in a shooting just after 11 p.m., police said, but it did not appear to have been associated with the protest. And the noise in the Highlands and in downtown Louisville had tapered off a bit as the night's demonstrations ended. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer addressed media members at 10:30 p.m. and tweeted around midnight a statement thanking those who had peacefully protested. Still, Saturday's protests were not unique to Louisville. Minnesota was a hotbed once again, but demonstrations in New York, Los Angeles (where around 500 arrests took place), Nashville, Cincinnati, Lexington and other notable metropolitan areas continued to rock the nation. • 1 a.m. – Protests had dwindled in some areas as we entered Sunday morning, but some demonstrators kept at it. A large number of officers were at the gas station at First Street and Broadway, according to The Courier Journal's Matt Glowicki, as protesters continued to make their presence known. Broadway was loud for much of the night, as cars of protesters laid on their horns to make a statement. • 12:30 a.m. – A fire broke out earlier in the evening at the McDonald's restaurant at Second Street and Broadway but had been mostly contained by 12:30 a.m. The scene on Broadway, though, was hectic, according to Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin, as a group of protesters moved through the area and were followed by police. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, meanwhile, issued a statement on Twitter thanking those who kept their cool throughout the night. ""Thanks to all who’ve abided by the curfew,"" Fischer wrote. ""I am gratified to say that the majority of people are staying home. I want to thank all those who came out tonight and protested peacefully, expressing your concerns about the tragic death of Breonna Taylor."" • Midnight – The scene had cleared significantly at Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue at midnight, with officers taking a quick snack break after using gas and what appeared to be pellet guns to clear a group of protesters at the high-profile Louisville intersection. Back in the heart of the city, near Fourth and Guthrie streets, the owner of escape room Locked In stood out front of his business with a rifle to keep back protesters after the establishment's glass door had been shattered earlier.

The shooting was reported at 11:05 p.m. No other information was immediately available. • 11:30 p.m. – Many protesters left the corner of Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue and others were pushed further back at 11:20 p.m. by launching some kind of gas toward the crowd, which had gathered peacefully well after the 9 p.m. curfew. Police fired pepper ball guns at those who stayed at the scene, as Courier Journal reporter Matt Glowicki broadcast live on Facebook. Near the hospitals on Floyd Street, meanwhile, a crowd kept moving with police following them, The Courier Journal's Billy Kobin reported. The two sides had not physically clashed. Kobin said dozens of cars were in the crowd, with six police vehicles following. • 11 p.m. – The scene is tense in the Highlands. Armored trucks and a large police presence have taken the corner of Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue. Police fired pepper balls and what seemed to be pepper spray at protesters after someone in the crowd threw a water bottle at the officers, The Courier Journal's Olivia Krauth reported. Traffic has been blocked off at the intersection. Courier Journal reporter Matt Glowicki has footage from the scene. Police and protesters were still on the streets downtown as well. Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin reported a large crowd moving down Broadway, with police in the area as well. • 10:45 p.m. – In a 10:30 p.m. press briefing, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said the situation on the streets was ""still evolving"" and he hoped Sunday Louisville could come together peacefully and set an example for the rest of the country. Tear gas has been deployed, Fischer said, and about 10 people have been arrested, though a Metro Corrections spokesman said earlier that number was higher. The mayor also defended officers who destroyed water bottles and milk gallons that belonged to protesters, saying flammable liquids and other hazardous materials had been placed with the water and milk. Those materials needed to • 10:15 p.m. – Metro Corrections spokesman Tracy Dotson told The Courier Journal at least 25 to 30 arrests have taken place Saturday night, a much higher number than had occurred in the previous two nights of protests. Meanwhile, the scene had cleared near Sixth and Main streets, The Courier Journal's Billy Kobin reported, while separate groups of protesters marched in other areas downtown and in NuLu and the Highlands. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer will address reporters at 10:30 p.m., his office said. • 10 p.m. – Police have fired tear gas into the crowd at Jefferson Square. At least one protester was seen being detained on Sixth Street. Mounted police were showing up near the Republic Bank building downtown. Meanwhile, there was a throng of protesters at Bardstown Road and Baxter Avenue. Police were staged at a nearby Walgreens. SWAT officers were seen gathering near Baxter and Broadway. • 9:30 p.m. – Protesters in the Highlands have continued to try to make their point, even as National Guard personnel move into the region. Much of the crowd congregated near Bardstown Road and Grinstead Drive. Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth said many protesters stopped at the Wendy's near that corner and would not go past a National Guard truck that was in the parking lot. Down the street outside Cave Hill Cemetery, Courier Journal reporter Matt Glowicki spoke with Tracy Grizzle and her daughter Abby. They live in the Highlands and came out with signs to show support. She said the protest had been peaceful. ""They're telling us to leave, so we're trying to follow the rules,"" she said, as cars passed them and honked in support. ""All it is is we're trying to get our message out."" • 9:15 p.m. – Police have deployed tear gas downtown in various areas, including outside the judicial center, as Saturday night's protests get hotter. Law enforcement officials had previously smashed milk jugs and water bottle belonging to protesters downtown earlier in the day. The officers continued to work to break up groups of protesters around Jefferson Square. Charles Booker, who is running for the Democratic nomination to run for Mitch McConnell's Senate seat in November, shared a video of police breaking up protesters with green gas well before 9 p.m. • 9 p.m. – The crowd on Sixth Street was sparse at 9 p.m., when the Saturday night curfew was set to take place. Moments earlier, Courier Journal photojournalist Pat McDonogh said, police had broken up a crowd in the area. Protesters were spread widely at Sixth and Jefferson streets in the aftermath. The Highlands protest, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth, began to splinter around 9 p.m., after a group leader said the National Guard was blocks away. • 8:45 p.m. – Groups of protesters have once again taken to different areas in the city. Protesters on Liberty Street began to flee toward sunset after a few flashbangs when off in the area around 8:30 p.m. That's happened a few times tonight, according to Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin. Along Bardstown Road, according to The Courier Journal's Olivia Krauth, a march was taking place that was mostly peaceful. The group blocked the intersection of Baxter Avenue and Broadway to get their message across. That group of protesters, Courier Journal photojournalist Michael Clevenger said, has bounced around the region quite a bit. • 8:15 p.m. — The crowd of protesters outside Metro Hall is separating. State police have deployed green smoke and pepper balls. State police warned protesters over a speaker to peacefully disperse and warned that they may dispense ""chemical agents for unlawful assembly."" The curfew officially begins at 9 p.m. • 8 p.m. – State police and LMPD are advancing toward protests outside police headquarters and the Hall of Justice at Seventh and Jefferson streets. Meanwhile, police have blocked off Bardstown Road at Lucia, just west of Mid City Mall. • 7:40 p.m. – Law enforcement officers are taking away protesters' stockpiles of water and milk at Jefferson Square. A Ford pickup pulled up on the sidewalk, and plainclothes police officers began throwing the cases of water into the back of the truck and discarding the milk, which protesters use to combat the effects of tear gas. Officers in the area have put on their gas masks. I cannot believe what I just witnessed. They pulled up onto the square with a police siren on and did this. #Louisvillepic.twitter.com/65o2lgZCJh — Natalie Neysa Alund (@nataliealund) May 30, 2020 • 7 p.m. – A crowd of about 100 protesters at Broadway and Baxter Avenue had gathered and were making their way toward the Highlands just after 7 p.m. At Sixth and Jefferson streets in downtown Lousiville, meanwhile, where the most heated moments of Thursday's protest took place, a crowd of 250 or so people had arrived from Sixth Street, chanting and blocking some cars in the area. • 6:45 p.m. – A group of protesters from Louisville blocked the Second Street Bridge into Southern Indiana. About 400 demonstrators who had marched to the bridge next to the Yum Center from Jefferson Square stood across the roadway, turning cars away to head back north to the Hoosier State. The protesters left the bridge about 15 minutes later. • 6:30 p.m. – In a sitdown interview with The Courier Journal, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer asked protesters to make their feelings known before the 9 p.m. curfew hits Saturday night. A lot of people are upset right now, Fischer said, and that's ""totally understandable."" But the tone of the protests turned Friday night, he said, and the property damage and ""anarchic element"" that came to the forefront later in the evening led to an escalation that did not need to continue on Saturday. Fischer, who said he'd been on a call with 30 other mayors earlier in the day, had brought in the National Guard earlier to assist with Saturday's protest. Systematic change is needed, he said, but ""we don't want a further escalation tonight that could potentially endanger more people. Check out more from the interview below. CLOSE Mayor Greg Fischer talked about deploying the National Guard and other decisions made after two nights of protests over the death of Breonna Taylor. Louisville Courier Journal • 5:45 p.m. – A small protest in Jeffersonville, Indiana brought together demonstrators at the Big Four Bridge. Those in attendance want the Indiana State Police to release body cam footage taken on the night Malcolm Williams was shot and killed in April by a trooper, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth. And there were some tense moments. The group ran into a crowd of hecklers on the patio of Parlour Pizza, along with some families who left amid the commotion. Things ratcheted up a notch at one point when a man from the patio got on a motorcycle and tried to leave by driving through the crowd on a two-way street. Police were blocking streets with their cars on a rolling basis as protesters moved along but did not appear to have much of a presence on foot.

The curfew begins at 9 p.m. Saturday and Sunday and ends at 6:30 a.m. Sunday and Monday, and excludes people traveling for work, worship or for medical purposes. Those who violate the order could be cited and will be asked to return home. • About 350 National Guard members from Kentucky will be in Louisville on Saturday in response to the previous nights' protests, Fischer and Gov. Andy Beshear announced. • All TARC Louisville bus services will be suspended at 7 p.m. Saturday, the organization announced earlier in the afternoon, but routes will resume on Sunday. • Louisville's EMW Women's Clinic, the only abortion clinic in Kentucky, was damaged Friday night, according to a Twitter post from an account operated by clinic escorts. Friday night highlights For the second night in a row, angry protesters crowded the streets and sidewalks of downtown Louisville – setting fires, blocking traffic, breaking windows, burning flags and protesting the March death of Breonna Taylor, the unarmed black woman killed in her apartment by Louisville police. The Courier Journal had reporters and photographers across downtown, talking to protesters, snapping photos and capturing videos while monitoring the situation. Here's a recap: • 1:15 a.m. – An angered Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer thanked police officers for showing restraint at Friday's protest, and said he hears those who protested peacefully. But the damage done to downtown businesses, he said, was unacceptable. ""This is not a protest. It is violence,"" Fischer said in a livestream just after 1 a.m. ""… No one stands up for justice and equality by smashing windows and burning property. This destruction will not be tolerated."" • 12:50 a.m. – A large numbers of officers moved toward the CVS on Fourth Street at around 12:45 a.m. Someone appeared to be hurt by the broken glass at the convenience store, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth. Traffic around the block backed up, Courier Journal reporter Matt Mencarini said, as the person who was injured was taken out on a stretcher. Some protesters appeared to leave the building, which had every glass window broken, with bottles of alcohol or other merchandise. Elsewhere, protesters looting a store at the downtown Omni Louisville Hotel were shown on WLKY. • 12:40 a.m. – The Kentucky International Convention Center sustained ""major glass and exterior damage"" during Friday's protest, according to Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles. The building was evacuated, he said, and it was far from the only building in downtown Louisville to take damage during the protest. • 12:30 a.m. – Protesters made off with one of the Gallopalooza horse statues in downtown Louisville, footage that aired on WLKY showed. Still elsewhere, the scene had cooled. At approximately 12:20 a.m., a line of law enforcement officers that had been standing shoulder-to-shoulder for hours by Metro Hall were at ease for the time. Each was given a bottle of water from a police vehicle. A handful of protesters half a block away could be seen throwing trash away and collecting pallets of unused water bottles and styrofoam coolers with jugs of milk inside to be taken away at the park at Sixth and Jefferson streets. A fire burned a block away on Seventh Street. • 12:20 a.m. – Groups of protesters were spread out in downtown Louisville, but it appeared some of the crowds had dwindled, according to Courier Journal reporters Olivia Krauth and Matt Mencarini. With broken windows and overturned plants behind them, many protesters left downtown. Police remained on Fifth Street and at one point threw tear gas at reporters and very few protesters on an otherwise silent Fourth Street. Still, some protesters, and a large police force, remained at various points throughout downtown. • 12:10 a.m. – LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said she's positive that the larger crowd at Friday's protest is because more out-of-town residents have made the trip to Louisville. Local police have been tracking social media posts throughout the day, she said, and learned of buses coming to Louisville from Indianapolis. Officers had also seen a large number of cars in the crowd with license plates from out of town. “It’s been a high-profile conversation and obviously we use a lot of intelligence about what’s occurring,” Halladay said. “With an active social media platform we can see a lot of people traveled here for this tonight.” • Midnight – Some crowds began to disperse downtown, though crowds remained in other areas, and the protest in the Highlands appeared to wind down. Protesters who had marched south down Bardstown Road, according to Courier Journal photographer Sam Upshaw Jr., stopped at Eastern Parkway and chanted before turning around. Their protest was peaceful, Upshaw and other Courier Journal reporters in the area reported. Some came close to engaging with a line of officers in front of Mid City Mall but were turned away by other protesters with megaphones urging them to move on. • 11:35 p.m. – No arrests have taken place Friday night, LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said in an update to media members at 11:30 p.m., and police do not believe any shots have been fired. When asked about a rumor circulating among protesters that police had been given authorization to use lethal force, Halladay characterized it as an attempt to incite panic in the crowd and get a reaction, though she added officers ""are always authorized to use lethal force if they are confronted with lethal force and they fear for their safety or the safety of others."" ""We have been doing what we can do to use these less lethal options of tear gas and pepper ball because they can help disperse and we wouldn’t have to use lethal force,"" she said. • 11:30 p.m. – WHAS was forced to evacuate its downtown Louisville studio Friday night amid protests in the area. The network's Senait Gebregiorgis tweeted at 11:20 p.m. that the TV crew had to leave after protesters smashed windows at the building. No one was hurt, she said. WHAS's office is at 520 W. Chestnut Street, three blocks from Jefferson Street. Glass has been broken out of the front of the WHAS building facing Chestnut Street, Courier Journal visual journalist Jeff Faughender reported. Large glass panes were broken out, other windows had holes in them. Graffiti with phrases like ""Pigs fly,"" was spray painted on the windows. Protesters, meanwhile, jumped on a WLKY TV van downtown, the network showed. • 11:25 p.m. – Footage showed at least two people break into the Eddie Merlot's steakhouse at Fourth Street Live and leave through shattered windows with bottles of alcohol. Protesters on the popular Louisville parying block also burned a Confederate flag, amid cheers. Looting had not been an issue at Thursday's protest, Louisville police confirmed Thursday afternoon. And while vandalism had been reported at several businesses around town Friday night, looting had not yet been seen as a widespread issue at the Louisville protests. CLOSE Footage obtained by The Courier Journal shows protesters entering Eddie Merlot's amid protests Friday night. May 29, 2020 Louisville Courier Journal On Fourth Street, according to Courier Journal reporter Sarah Ladd, several stores’ windows and glass doors were shattered. A large bush burned at the bottom of the Fifth Third Bank building. Hard Rock Cafe's alarm rang as shattered glass spilled into the road. • 11:15 p.m. – WAVE 3 representatives declined to comment in the immediate aftermath of an incident in which it appeared a police officer shot what looked like pepper balls from a gun at a reporter and camera operator. The Courier Journal's Tessa Duvall reached out to the station and to Louisville police in following the incident, which aired live on TV and immediately went viral. Jessie Halladay, a spokeswoman for LMPD, said at 11:30 p.m. Friday that she had reviewed the video and said it was too difficult to tell who the officer was at this time. Halladay apologized, and said, it's ""not our intention to target or subject the media as they try to cover this."" Check out the full story, with the video, here. • 11:05 p.m. – A group of protesters were working their way down Bardstown Road just after 11 p.m. amid a busy night in Louisville. The crowd appeared to be largely peaceful, as police lined the streets and a helicopter took to the air above them. Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin said the protesters at Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue were young. They lined down the street toward the Speedway at the Grinstead Road intersection. • 11 p.m. – Fireworks were set off at the corner of Sixth and Jefferson streets moments earlier, and protests a block away at Sixth and Market had left a mark. Garbage cans that had been set on fire had melted into the street, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth. A Subway and Republic Bank were vandalized, and protesters and drivers confronted one another at various points. The site hasn't hosted especially large crowds for much of the night but had seen plenty of action. A line of police, though, moved around 11 p.m. from Metro Hall toward Sixth Street. They left the scene at Sixth and Market without issue, Krauth said. On Jefferson Street at about 11 p.m., teenagers and young people walked toward advancing police in riot gear who had previously deployed tear gas, and the police then halted their advance as the situation appeared to hit a standstill. Protesters unfurled a banner that said ""This will not continue."" • 10:40 p.m. – No shots have been fired at Friday night's protest, LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay told The Courier Journal at 10:35 p.m., and no significant injuries have been reported. Two arrests have taken place. • 10:30 p.m. – In front of Metro Hall, police appear to have made an effort to split up groups of protesters. Courier Journal reporter Mandy McLaren was at the scene for an hour and reported at least 100 people were in front of the building, the site of Thursday night's confrontation, at 10:30 p.m., with officers lined shoulder-to-shoulder near Fifth and Jefferson streets to prevent two separate groups of protesters (one of at least 50 people in front of the Chase Bank, the other closer to Metro Hall) from joining together. Tear gas was dispersed minutes later, at 10:40 p.m. Tensions arose earlier in front of the Hall of Justice around sundown before that crowd moved toward Metro Hall after being dispersed by officers. • 9:45 p.m. – A lively but peaceful evening was interrupted at sundown as police shoulder-to-shoulder in riot gear with face shields, gas masks, batons and other protective gear moved protesters down Jefferson Street toward Sixth Street. The police unit rolled up just before 9:30 p.m., a half-hour after protesters at the Hall of Justice pulled down American and Kentucky flags and set them ablaze. Moments later, some protesters threw objects at the building's glass doors, more items were lit on fire and three loud bangs went off. A group of more than 1,000 people were estimated to be gathering around the Hall of Justice where everything seems to be focused. Earlier coverage from Friday Groups of protesters demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, who was an African American woman killed in her apartment by police officers on March 13, gathered in downtown Louisville. Earlier in the day, the group which was more than 500 gathered at Jefferson Street with two helicopters circling overhead, including a LMPD chopper. The groups had speakers talking from the steps of Metro Hall. The crowd has continued to grow as the evening demonstrations carried on. Hundreds also knelt between Broadway and Jefferson Street with their fists are in the air and marched around the police department chanting, 'No justice no peace.' At least one protester was against banging on the glass of the Hall of Justice steps. Protesters were also seen banging on glass at Hall of Justice steps calling for officers to come outside.

LMPD arrested and charged an Owensboro resident, 25-year-old Adair Henderson, with disorderly conduct and failure to disperse, according to an arrest citation. The offense of first-degree disorderly conduct is a Class A misdemeanor in Kentucky that is punishable by 90 days to one year in jail and a maximum $500 fine. Failure to to disperse is a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a maximum $250 fine. Stephanie Garvin and David Wheatley, both of Louisville, were also booked into Metro Corrections about 2 a.m. Friday and each charged with first-degree criminal mischief and first-degree riot, court records show. Garvin, 28, was seen by officers and captured on surveillance footage busting out the windows of a Metro Corrections van and throwing objects at the Metro Corrections building, according to her arrest citation. Wheatley, 27, was also seen breaking out the window of a Metro Corrections van and busting a window on the side of the Metro Corrections building, according to his citation. The charges of first-degree riot and first-degree criminal mischief are both Class D felonies in Kentucky, which are punishable by one to five years in prison. Louisville mayor: No-knock warrants will be suspended Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said Friday morning that five of the shooting victims from the protest are in ""good condition"" and that the two victims who required surgery are now ""stable and recovering."" The mayor also said that he is suspending the use of no-knock warrants by police and that all officers will now be required to wear body cameras while executing search warrants. Fischer said the gunfire that wounded seven people ""came from within the crowd, not from officers."" LMPD Assistant Chief of Police LaVita Chavous said LMPD has ""no leads on the shooter"" but is continuing to investigate. Two LMPD officers were also taken to the hospital with chest pains ""spurred"" by the protest, Chavous said, with one officer remaining in the hospital overnight before getting released. 'It is not a riot. It is a revolt': Councilwoman responds to Breonna Taylor protest The mayor mentioned damage to vehicles and statues. Protesters tore off the right hand of the King Louis XVI statue that stands on a pedestal at Sixth and Jefferson streets. After shots were fired in the crowd, officers deployed tear gas, pepper ball and smoke grenades ""after several verbal warnings were given ordering people to disperse,"" Washington said. ""Contrary to what you may have heard, LMPD does not utilize rubber bullets,"" Washington added. ""Pepper balls are similar to paint balls and often time leave welts on a person’s body after being struck."" Chavous would not disclose how many officers were on hand for Thursday's protest. When and where did the Thursday protest start? The gathering began as early as 6 or 7 p.m. and stretched past midnight. Crowds moved from outside City Hall on Sixth Street to in front of the KFC Yum Center, where more police officers began to engage with the crowd. As heavy rains moved into the area in the early morning hours, much of the crowd dispersed. How many protesters were there? An estimated 500 to 600 protesters gathered in the streets of downtown Louisville. The initially peaceful protest escalated as the night drew on, with the crowd being teargassed and glass storefronts shattered. By 10 p.m., at least one group could be seen verbally clashing with police officers near the Yum Center. The officers carried wooden batons and were wearing body armor and face shields. An armored truck was stationed nearby. It is unknown how many officers were called in to the protest. At one point, protesters threw things at police officers and kicked a patrol car. When one officer was surrounded by protesters near Bearno's by the Bridge, a pizza parlor near the Second Street bridge and the Yum Center, protest organizers stepped in to make sure the officer was not harmed.

May 28, 2020 (Photo: Pat McDonogh / Courier Journal) Around 11 p.m., a line of officers advanced down East Main Street, dispersing a large crowd. But not long after, hundreds congregated a few blocks south again in front of Metro Hall, where a group of protesters had been trying to tip an armored vehicle, breaking its windows and slashing its tires. Just before 11:30 p.m., multiple rounds of gunfire then rang out near Sixth and Jefferson streets. At least seven wounded victims were seen being carried away on stretchers. LMPD later confirmed that seven people had been shot and two required surgery. Who fired the shots? Who was arrested? LMPD said its officers did not fire their guns. As Chavous noted Friday morning, LMPD has ""no leads on the shooter,"" but the department's homicide unit is continuing to investigate. Apart from the Owensboro resident charged with disorderly conduct, police said several individuals were booked into Louisville Metro Corrections, with jail records indicating charges of first-degree riot and first-degree criminal mischief. Louisville mayor: 'Answering violence with violence' not the answer to Taylor death Why was there a protest? The death of Taylor, who was fatally shot March 13 by LMPD officers in her southwest Louisville apartment, was the main issue on the minds of protesters. Taylor's case has gained national and international attention in recent weeks as more information came to light on how police forced their way into her apartment as part of a narcotics investigation. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he and Taylor were scared and unsure of who was trying to gain entry to the apartment that night, while the officers have claimed they announced themselves several times. After officers used a battering ram to force their way into the apartment on Springfield Drive, Walker fired one shot that he says was in self-defense before the three officers responded with a hail of bullets, hitting Taylor eight times. No drugs were found inside Taylor's apartment. The FBI and Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron have since announced separate reviews of Taylor's death and the actions of the LMPD officers. Was the protest also about George Floyd? As mentioned, protesters focused mainly on calling for justice in Taylor's death. But the protests in Louisville unfurled as other cities saw similar demonstrations over police killings of black Americans, including in Phoenix, Denver and Minneapolis, where a man named George Floyd died after a white officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck. Floyd's death this week was captured on camera. That footage, coupled with how a transcript of a 911 call revealed that a clerk had accused Floyd of buying cigarettes with fake money, ignited protests around the country. Ben Crump, the Florida-based attorney representing Taylor's family, appeared Friday morning on MSNBC and called the recent, high-profile killings of black Americans “a national pandemic that’s affecting all African Americans.” “It is a state of emergency,” he said. What did Taylor's family and others say? As the situation in downtown Louisville escalated, Taylor's family took to social media to plead for peace. ""We are not going to stop until we get justice,"" Juniyah Palmer, Taylor's younger sister, said in a video. ""But we should stop tonight before people get hurt."" And during a Friday appearance on CNN, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read a statement from Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer: ""Breonna devoted her own life to saving other lives, to helping others, to making people smile, and to bringing people together. The last thing she’d want right now is any more violence. Changes are being made, but it’s not enough. We will not stop until there is truth, justice and accountability. Breonna’s legacy will not be forgotten. And it’s because of all of us saying her name and demanding justice. We are saying her name more each day. Thank you. Please keep saying her name. Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let’s do it the right way without hurting each other. We can, and we will make some real change here. Now’s the time. Let’s make it happen."" How many protesters were there Thursday? An estimated 500 to 600 protesters gathered in the streets of downtown Louisville for several hours. The gathering began as early as 6 or 7 p.m. and stretched past midnight. Where did it take place Thursday? Crowds moved from outside City Hall on Sixth Street to in front of the KFC Yum Center, where more police officers began to engage with the crowd. This story will be updated.

Several hundred people there were protesting the March fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor in her apartment, which police entered while she was asleep. AD AD Six or seven shots were also fired near a crowd in Denver on Thursday evening, but a police spokesman said no one was injured. Late into the night, officials pleaded with protesters to remain peaceful. “I certainly understand everyone’s frustration and sense of pain and disgust following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis,” Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock (D) said in a video message Thursday night. “But I want to plead to everyone, let’s demonstrate, but let’s demonstrate peacefully. Leave the weapons home, and let’s march together in unity and let’s have our voices heard, but keep everyone safe. That’s the way we need to do this.” UPDATE: Police line has moved up. Things have escalated. Police have used spray to push crowd back. @nbc4i pic.twitter.com/VpAsv0kJig — Eric Halperin (@EricHalperinTV) May 29, 2020 Thursday marked the third night of protests after Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin was captured on video digging his knee into the back of Floyd’s neck as Floyd cried, “I can’t breathe!” before he died. AD AD In Louisville, multiple protests had also broken out since Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was shot and killed by police. When narcotics detectives broke down her door after midnight, her boyfriend fired a gun, thinking armed intruders had entered the home. Police shot Taylor eight times when they returned fire. They found no drugs. The Louisville protests appeared to reach a fever pitch Thursday night. Protesters blocked buses, broke an arm off a statue of King Louis XVI outside City Hall and threw fireworks at police officers, WFPL reported. Then, around 11:30 p.m., gunfire erupted from within the crowd, police said. Of the seven people shot, at least two were in surgery and five were in good condition as of early Friday morning, said Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer (D), adding that no police officers fired their weapons. Police spokeswoman Alicia Smiley said officers made multiple arrests but said she was unable to elaborate on how many or whether the arrests were connected to the shooting. AD AD Fischer said, “I feel the community’s frustration, but tonight’s violence and destruction is not the way to solve it.” He shared a video message from Taylor’s sister, Juniyah Palmer, urging everyone to be peaceful. “Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna’s name tonight,” she said. “We are not going to stop until we get justice, but we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.” More than 1,000 miles away, in Denver, shots rang out at about 5:30 p.m., close enough to the state capitol building to alarm lawmakers inside. “I did not see who shot. … They shot into a crowd of people protesting police brutality,” state Rep. Leslie Herod (D) told the Denver Post, adding that police inside the building instructed people to take cover. “It’s an act of violence against our community.” AD AD Protesters spray-painted “Black Lives Matter” and Floyd’s name on the capitol steps, footage from CBS Denver shows, while some smashed vehicles parked in the building’s parking lot. Hundreds of others blocked traffic on Interstate 25 and marched down one busy street against traffic. A viral video soon emerged showing one protester on the hood of a car before jumping off. The driver then circled back around to ram into the protester, who fell to the pavement before getting back up. Denver police spokesman Kurt Barnes said no arrests have been made in either the shooting or the apparent hit-and-run. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) said he was “absolutely shocked” by the video of the driver apparently attempting to run over the protester. AD “Coloradans are better than this,” he wrote on Twitter. “I share the immense anguish we all feel about the unjust murder of George Floyd. But let me be clear, senseless violence will never be healed by more violence.” AD Elsewhere, police in New York arrested at least 70 protesters at Union Square, NBC New York reported. In Columbus, protesters reportedly breached the Ohio Statehouse, breaking windows and running inside, according to WCMH.

Protesters in Phoenix resisted calls to disperse after police declared the protest an unlawful assembly around 11 p.m., the Arizona Republic reported.

Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, who in March was shot and killed in her apartment by Louisville police — one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. Anger over the deaths boiled over in protests across the U.S. on Thursday evening, including the violent clash on Louisville's streets that, as of early Friday morning, had left at least one gunshot victim in critical condition. Louisville police did not shoot their guns, according to an LMPD spokesperson. Buy Photo A young woman holds up a fist in the intersection of Sixth and Jefferson Streets. May 28, 2020 (Photo: Pat McDonogh / Courier Journal) ""It is not a riot,"" said Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey, who watched as hundreds gathered Thursday night. ""It is a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed. What I'm seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration."" Dorsey, D-3rd District, represents Shively and part of western Louisville. Who was Breonna Taylor? What we know about the Louisville ER tech Also: Breonna Taylor protest in downtown Louisville draws hundreds. Here's what we know In what began as a peaceful demonstration, an estimated 500 to 600 people marched through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of paintballs at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. Protesters tore off the right hand of the King Louis XVI statue that stands on a pedestal at Sixth and Jefferson streets. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer responded to the unrest shortly before midnight, posting on Twitter, ""Understandably, emotions are high,"" along with a statement posted earlier in the evening from Taylor's family. That statement, attributed to Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, thanked protesters for ""giving Bre a voice tonight,"" while also asking crowds to ""keep it peaceful."" Fischer's tweet concluded: ""As Breonna’s mother says, let’s be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice."" Hear from our reporter from the scene: Courier Journal's Cameron Teague Robinson shares what he saw at Breonna Taylor protest Protesters flooded downtown just hours after The Courier Journal obtained and reported Thursday afternoon the 911 call made in the immediate aftermath of Taylor's death. The 26-year-old EMT died in the hall of her apartment after police officers executed a ""no-knock"" search warrant in the early morning hours of March 13 as part of a narcotics investigation. She was struck by at least eight bullets. Throughout the evening, many protesters could be seen holding both hands in the air, as if to show they were unarmed. ""We came for peace,"" one man said over a bullhorn. Most of those gathered appeared to be wearing face masks. Rally organizers led chants. Signs were held high. One read, ""Who do you call when police murder?"" What we know: Breonna Taylor protest in downtown Louisville draws hundreds Early on, large crowds chanted, ""No justice! No peace! Prosecute the police!"" Protesters, many of them white, linked arms, forming a wall across Sixth Street between Louisville City and Metro halls. One held a sign that read, ""Until all police states burn we fight for black lives."" “Say her name!” yelled Chanelle Helm, a leader for Black Lives Matter Louisville. “Breonna!” the crowd called in return. By 10 p.m., at least one group could be seen verbally clashing with police officers near the Yum Center. The officers carried wooden batons and were wearing body armor and face shields. An armored truck was stationed nearby. ""Good cops need to start speaking up and standing up!"" one man yelled. “My son is 13 and is scared to walk down the street!"" shouted a woman. ""Please avoid the area until further notice!"" a Twitter post from Louisville Metro Police said. 911 call from shooting: 'Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend' At one point, protesters threw things at police officers and kicked a patrol car. When one officer was surrounded by protesters near Bearno's by the Bridge, a pizza parlor near the Second Street bridge and the Yum Center, protest organizers stepped in to make sure the officer was not harmed.

(Photo: Michael Clevenger/Courier Journal) Around 11 p.m., a line of officers advanced down East Main Street, dispersing a large crowd. But not long after, hundreds congregated in front of Metro Hall, where a group of protesters had been trying to tip an armored vehicle, breaking its windows and slashing its tires. Multiple rounds of gunfire then rang out. At least seven injured people, their wounds seeping blood, were seen being carried away on stretchers. Read more: What to know about the investigations into the shooting of Taylor Protesters in recent days have demanded that officers involved in Taylor's death — identified by the department as Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly and officers Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove — be fired. They've also called for a ban on no-knock warrants. No drugs were recovered from Taylor's home. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired his weapon and struck a police officer in the femoral artery as they entered the apartment, and Taylor was struck in the ensuing gunfire. In the 911 call, Walker can be heard crying out Taylor's name and calling for help as he tries to speak to a dispatcher. ""I don't know what is happening,"" said Walker, 27. ""Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend."" Her death has sparked questions from activists and family members about what led to the fatal shooting and drastically increased pressure on local officials in recent weeks. Police Chief Steve Conrad announced last week he would retire at the end of June, and Fischer has said he's turned over findings of an internal police investigation to the U.S. Attorney's Office and FBI. The FBI has also opened its own independent investigation. The Courier Journal late Tuesday sued the city's police department for records related to the investigation after officials refused to turn them over. Bernard Bradberry, 44, came to the protest with his 16-year-old son, A.J. Hall. ""We want justice,"" said A.J., who pushed his father along the downtown streets in a wheelchair. Bradberry said many African Americans in Louisville are angered by more than just Taylor's death. “Because of all the other violence going on in the country, too,"" he said. ""All of it’s been led up to this."" The Louisville protests come less than a day after unrest erupted in Minneapolis in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. Protests in Minneapolis continued Thursday night, with large crowds also rallying in Phoenix, Denver and Columbus, Ohio. Read more: 'It is not a riot. It is a revolt': Councilwoman responds to protest In downtown Louisville, Bradberry called what he and others see as a lack of police accountability ""a slap in the face."" ""It’s like, do they even feel sorry for what they’ve done?"" he asked. Courtney Artis, of Jeffersontown, said she attended the protest because she was “tired of police.” “It’s not right that they keep killing black people,” she said. “My parents are from Birmingham, Alabama, and I’m tired of them repeating history. We’ve been peaceful too long, so that’s why we’re out here.” Artis said she hoped the protest would pressure officials to charge the officers involved in Taylor’s death. “They need to go to jail like anybody else would,” she said. “If I killed somebody, I would get held accountable, right? Right. So, I want them to be held accountable also.” USA TODAY contributed to this report.

Last night in early this morning, a few 100 protesters gathered in the streets of downtown Louisville. They wanted to express their frustration and their pain that so many people in our community are feeling about the tragic death of Rihanna Taylor. For several hours the protests were peaceful and I thank the majority of people who demonstrated that they understand that peaceful protests is the right path to creating the change that we all seek. Colonel Shay Vis will go into the details. But we know that after several hours of peaceful protest, some members of the crowd turned violent. We know that five of the shooting victims are in good condition. Additional tube were sent to surgery moments ago. The hospital has told us that they are all stable and recovering. My prayers are with all of them and I'm thankful for that news. The's shots came from within the crowd, not from police officers. No officers fired their weapons. If you hear anything to the contrary, that is not factual. The officers, rather a great risk to themselves, immediately went to provide aid to those who were injured. And I thank them for that to the people who gathered downtown last night to protest into many more throughout our city and throughout our country who feel angry, hurt, afraid, frustrated, tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law enforcement. I hear you. I frequently spoken about spoken about that historical injustice, but we must find a way to stop this cycle of injustice. But the violence and demonstration and the destruction that we saw last night will not get us there. It will create MAWR tragedies rather than prevent them. And we have to work together as a community to present to prevent further tragedies. That's why I asked the FBI, the U. S. Attorney in the Kentucky Attorney General, Daniel Cameron, to investigate what happened on the night of March 13th why it happened and what needs to happen now so that justice can be served and so that we can learn how to avoid the circumstances around the tragic death of Briana. That's what you want. That's what I want. And that's why we've already made numerous changes at L. M P D. To provide more scrutiny, transparency and accountability amongst them. A new police chief will be named. A new level of oversight has been added to the LMP d. Our body camera policy has been changed to require their use for all officers executing search warrants. We're also establishing a new civilian review board for police disciplinary matters. I'll be meeting with that working group that's putting the civilian process together in 11 oclock this morning just a few minutes, and I will be asking them to recommend a board with subpoena power. While we recently changed our policy for no knock warrants, the use of no knock warrants will be suspended until further notice. These changes and more to come we're not done should signal that I hear the community and we will continue to make improvements anywhere that we can really. Taylor's name and her story will now be part of our city's history. But is Briana's family shared last night? Answering violence with violence on Lee makes things worse. I want to really thank them for helping us to work, to restore peace. You can imagine the pain that they are having is a family right now, and yet they're still can still concerned about the safety of our community I thank the family. They're right. The fight for justice cannot be won with guns and vandalism. It can only be one with persistence and commitment to the shared goal of creating a city of peace, safety, equality and justice for everyone. Other cities across America experience protests last night, making it clear once again that we as a community in a country, have much work to do to advance our goal of a society where all people have the opportunity to reach their full potential and to live safely in Louisville. We have been committed to this work for years, and while the events of recent weeks have shown that we still have much to do, we have always known that we're committed to this work, whatever it takes and for a long as it takes. And I ask everyone in our community everyone in every neighborhood, every age, every color to join us. I know that while some of us have been up most all night, many of our citizens, I'm sure, are waking up to the painful news of what happened last night. Let's use this sad occasion is a wake up call for our entire community. to come together like we never had before. This is a challenge for the entire community, not just black Louisville White, Louisville, Brown, Louisville, Black America, White America, Brown America. This is the challenge of our time that we must rise to. So let's rise to the challenge of this moment and work for the truth. Work for peace, work for justice. For Briana Taylor, her family and for all of the people of our city, they deserve it. We deserve it. I'd now like to introduce Colonel Shay Vis will be giving more details on this case. And then I will return to read a statement from Briana Taylor's family. Colonel. Thank you, Mary. Good afternoon. First, I want to say we at L NPD certainly understand anger the frustration we saw for many last night during the protest downtown. We know there is much work to be done to build and restore trust in this community. Argo was to allow for a peaceful display of that anger of that frustration which we were able to do in to allow during the first several hours of the event. However, once we started seeing significant property damage to cars and buildings downtown. Small fires started in garbage cans. We had to move in to take more action and try to disperse crowds. It wasn't until after shots were fired in the crowd that officers fired tear gas. And then it was only to a enable victims. I'm sorry it was only today enable officers to reach victims and provide medical aid, even with bottles and other objects being thrown at them. Their concern was for those people who were hurt. Overall, seven people were shot last night by other members of the crowd. No officers, far the weapons. Multiple shots were fired throughout the duration of the event. We're very fortunate. There were not additional victims. Only one of those shot is in critical condition at this time. We're still collecting information on all the damage, but we know there were many windows broken in downtown buildings. Bricks were thrown into buildings. Shots were fired into buildings, including the courthouse and Ellen PD headquarters. Graffiti was painted in several places, including the firefighter memorial. Additionally, several government and personal vehicles were damaged during the event. Two officers were taken to the hospital with medical conditions spurred by the event, L M. P D. Made one arrest oven Owens, borough resident for disorderly conduct and failure to disperse. Moving forward. We understand there are several additional protests planned for over the weekend. All off days for officers have been canceled as we ready to staff any additional situations that arise again. Our goal will be to allow for the peaceful expression of protest. We value the right to free speech and understand This community has a lot to say. Right now we hear you, we will not tolerate Valence that leads to people being hurt. We will not tolerate destruction of our beautiful city. We are prepared to take whatever action we must to try to ensure no one else is injured. During this time of unrest, we asked the community to please voice your opinions in a peaceful way. Thank you. I like to close with a statement from the family of Briana Taylor. Briana devoted her own life to saving other lives, to helping others, to making people smile and to being to bring people together. The last thing that she'd want to see right now is any more violence. Changes were being made, but it's not enough. We will not stop until there's truth, justice and accountability. Brianna's legacy will not be for gotten. It's because of all of us saying her name and demanding justice. We're saying her name Mawr each day. Thank you. At least keep saying her name. Please keep demanding justice and accountability. But let's do it the right way without hurting each other. We can, and we will make some real change here. Now is the time. Let's make it happen. But safely, Hash tag freeway again. I want to thank the family for recognized the importance of peaceful protests, the ability of that to make change. I like to call on everybody in the community to work together to make sure that we get to that, changes expeditiously as possible and do so in a peaceful way that at this time I'm happy to take any questions if they come in from the media, not seeing any right now. Question is, ah, were the seven shooting victims injured in the same shooting episode Colonel? Yes. The answer to that question is that all seven victims were injured in the same shooting incident. We had two officers that were taken to the hospital with chest pains. One officer was kept overnight in the other officer are believed was released. Other questions on there is Can we estimate the cost of damage? Ah, not at this point. The damage was mainly broken windows, some cars on the streets. Uh, some statuary. It's all unfortunate, but it's not a huge amount of money, I'm sure. But it's the it's the emphasis here is Let's protest peacefully. Let's see. Um, are there any leads on the shooters? Seven people is not injured is not an insignificant number. One person is too many. So of course, that is significant. Ah, there are no leads on the shooter, but we are Homicide unit is still investigating and so we hope to have some leads after the investigation is complete. We do not like to disclose that information on how many officers were on the scene, but there were several officers. There are no plans at this time to bring in national guard. We are considering the possibility of bringing other agencies outside of Louisville to help us. Ah, we will be discussing our plans later on today. So we will have a plan in place to deal with any protests that occur. I'd like to thank everybody for their questions. We will have a another media availability later this afternoon. Again, I just want to emphasize that we understand I feel is best as I can The pain and frustration of our community. We have taken significant action since this incident will continue to take mawr action as we can, uh, out of out of this tragedy. And I just asked people toe recognize that we understand this is one incident in a book of unequal power dynamics between law enforcement and African Americans in America for 400 years. And as this is playing out in our city, I think our opportunity is to show the rest of the country how we can get this right now. We can work together to make change, to make positive change and do so in a peaceful manner. Ultimately, that is the only way forward. We're all going to be here when this is all said and done. So I encourage the community to join us in that dialogue. Join us in that action and peacefully protest. Thank you. And we'll be back this afternoon.

1620175778,2020-05-29 11:08:44,7 shot in downtown Louisville at Breonna Taylor protest. Here's what we know,http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/625458774/0/cincinnati-home~shot-in-downtown-Louisville-at-Breonna-Taylor-protest-Heres-what-we-know/,en,False,,82890,nky.cincinnati.com,http://nky.cincinnati.com/#spider,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Sunday has not been a slow news day in the Bluegrass State. In the aftermath of a third night of protests that took place Saturday over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, several demonstrations have popped up across Louisville on Sunday, and city officials have released more information about what's taken place over the weekend. Here's what's happening around the city. • 10:45 p.m. — In a media briefing, Mayor Greg Fischer called for a ""day of reflection"" on Monday, as Sunday night protests began to taper off. Fischer said local faith leaders would have a virtual call on Facebook Live at 11:30 a.m. Monday to mourn those who have died in the coronavirus pandemic -- ""that's one of my worries about all these people being together,"" Fischer added. LMPD Lt. Colonel LaVita Chavous took the mic afterward and said more than 40 arrests have taken place after a peaceful protest earlier turned unlawful. She added that ""anarchists"" had ""infiltrated"" the crowd as well, and they were using the peaceful protest for their own purposes. Chavous said the peaceful protest at Jefferson Square Park was unlawful, as it took place without a permit, which led to officers breaking it up before curfew. The officer who fired pepper balls at a WAVE 3 crew on Friday, meanwhile, is being investigated and will be reassigned in the meantime, Chavous said. • 10:30 p.m. — Louisville police have addressed an allegation reported by WDRB from Metro Council President David James that protesters were fired upon because they were carrying leaf blowers with bleach to shoot at police. Six or so protesters were arrested minutes earlier near Broadway and Brook Street, while other arrests have taken place in the meantime. An estimated crowd of 1,000 had gathered earlier before sunset at Jefferson Square Park. That group split up, though, after being confronted by police. LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay, meanwhile, said while they had not confirmed protesters were carrying leaf blowers with the intent to harm police, they had seen demonstrators carrying them in the crowd. ""We saw people with leaf blowers in the crowd,"" Hallday told The Courier Journal's Sarah Ladd. ""We know those are used for things like dispensing powder chemicals and for blowing gas back toward police. We don’t have any confirmation they were used for either purpose. The threat of that use is one reason we decided to disperse the crowd prior to curfew."" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer will address media at 10:45 p.m. for a Sunday night update. • 10:15 p.m. — Police arrested around six demonstrators near Broadway and Brook Street. Louisville's curfew went into effect at 9 p.m., though police fired tear gas at protesters at Jefferson Square Park before that deadline. Last night, Mayor Greg Fischer said 40-50 people were arrested during the protests. • 9:45 p.m — Broadway was completely blocked at First Street just before 9:45 p.m. Protesters have been scattered around downtown since being split up from a meeting point at Jefferson Square Park at around 8:20 p.m. A large police presence has come to a standstill by the gas station at First Street, with a lot of police vehicles on and helicopters in the air. • 9:30 p.m — Jefferson Square Park is packed with law enforcement officials at sundown, and protesters on Broadway were met with pepper balls and tear gas, according to Courier Journal and USA TODAY reporters Darcy Costello and Natalie Alund. The crowd was heading toward the Highlands, where another large protest took place Saturday night. Tear gas is in the air, Costello said – you can feel it in your throat. Police are using vans to rapidly redeploy across the city to reach different groups of protesters. • 9 p.m — We've hit curfew in Louisville. About 1,000 protesters who rallied earlier in the evening split up after being confronted by police at around 8:15 p.m. A large police presence was by the Brown Hotel on Broadway at 9 p.m. cars honked and the sun continued to set. Car protests have been common throughout the weekend protests. • 8:45 p.m — Citing an anti-riot statute, police have taken steps early Sunday night to break up protests, even before the 9 p.m. curfew. Tear gas and flash bangs scattered crowds at Jefferson Square Park, according to Courier Journal reporter Darcy Costello, as some protesters dispersed toward Fourth Street, which has taken heavy damage amid three previous nights of demonstrations, and others spread to other pockets of downtown Louisville. Officers have cleared out Jefferson Square Park. pic.twitter.com/behNAcEglB — Darcy Costello (@dctello) June 1, 2020 Law enforcement members in full camo took their place on some downtown streets leading up to and during the confrontation. National Guard members had been called in by officials to assist after Friday's protests, while Kentucky State Police officers are also alongside Louisville Metro Police officers. • 8:20 p.m. — Protesters were told by a speaker with a megaphone to take children home just before 8 p.m., and 10 minutes later police announced that the demonstration was an ""unlawful assembly,"" though Louisville's curfew was not scheduled to begin until 9 p.m. The person with the megaphone told the crowd that tear gas and flash bangs would be fired, causing some to leave the scene. At 8:19 p.m., police followed through, firing flash bangs and tear gas into the crowd at Jefferson Square Park. • 7:45 p.m. — Protesters took to the street on Broadway and raised their fists as police officers looked on at around 7:30 p.m. Sunday, according to Courier Journal reporter Darcy Costello. The group, which numbered in the hundreds, knelt in front of Metro Corrections minutes later. The number of protesters is high Sunday night, those in the field say. Another group has gathered at Sixth and Liberty streets, where officers destroyed protesters' milk jugs and water bottles a night earlier. Meanwhile, a MetroSafe supervisor said one person was taken to the hospital with life-threatening injuries after having being shot at Seventh and Hill streets, according to Courier Journal reporter Sarah Ladd. It's unknown if the shooting is related to the protest. • 7 p.m. — By around 7 p.m, an estimated crowd of 1,000 had gathered on Broadway and Roy Wilkins, filling all six lanes of Roy Wilkins, to demand justice for Breonna Taylor. • 6 p.m. — Mayor Greg Fischer said Monday will be designated as a ""Day of Reflection"" to reflect on what needs to change to combat racism in the city. There will be a virtual gathering on Facebook Live at 11:30 a.m. The day will also honor the people from Louisville who have died from the coronavirus. Here's a quick look at what you may have missed earlier Sunday. • Around 40 people were arrested at Saturday night's protests, according to Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, as the National Guard was called in to assist. Saturday was the first day a 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. curfew was in effect — the curfew also applies Sunday night and will be reevaluated on Monday. • A number of maximum security inmates broke an interior dormitory window overnight at the jail, according to a Metro Corrections release, and they damaged some property in the jail before the disturbance was quelled. Four suffered minor injuries. None of the inmates involved were arrested at the weekend protests, the release said. • While volunteers downtown cleaned up, more demonstrations took place around town Sunday afternoon, including one notable gathering in St. Matthews and an address by local pastors at 13th Street and Broadway. • A police cruiser was hit by at least one bullet on Saturday night, Fischer said Sunday. The car was near Ninth and Broadway. Three officers were inside and no one was injured. From Saturday night A third night of protests erupted in Louisville on Saturday, with a heavier police presence taking to the streets to match the local demonstrators. The demonstrations are part of a national movement and in Louisville have taken place over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, an African American who was unarmed when police executed a ""no-knock"" search warrant at her apartment and returned fire when her boyfriend fired on them. He has said he thought they were intruders. Livestream: Third night of Breonna Taylor protests in Louisville. Watch the footage While much of what's occurred at the two protests has been peaceful, Thursday night's demonstration was marred by a shooting that injured seven people and Friday night saw looting and widespread damage throughout downtown as police fired tear gas at several groups. On Saturday, Mayor Greg Fischer and Gov. Andy Beshear called for the National Guard to assists in the city, and the added police presence was felt -- looting and major property damage did not appear to be an issue, though officers and protesters clashed throughout the night in the Highlands and downtown. The Courier Journal had reporters and photographers around the city to cover Saturday's protests in real time. Here's a look back at what happened. • 2 a.m. – A busy night across Louisville appeared to be slowing to a halt in the early hours of Sunday morning. Two people were injured in a shooting just after 11 p.m., police said, but it did not appear to have been associated with the protest. And the noise in the Highlands and in downtown Louisville had tapered off a bit as the night's demonstrations ended. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer addressed media members at 10:30 p.m. and tweeted around midnight a statement thanking those who had peacefully protested. Still, Saturday's protests were not unique to Louisville. Minnesota was a hotbed once again, but demonstrations in New York, Los Angeles (where around 500 arrests took place), Nashville, Cincinnati, Lexington and other notable metropolitan areas continued to rock the nation. • 1 a.m. – Protests had dwindled in some areas as we entered Sunday morning, but some demonstrators kept at it. A large number of officers were at the gas station at First Street and Broadway, according to The Courier Journal's Matt Glowicki, as protesters continued to make their presence known. Broadway was loud for much of the night, as cars of protesters laid on their horns to make a statement. • 12:30 a.m. – A fire broke out earlier in the evening at the McDonald's restaurant at Second Street and Broadway but had been mostly contained by 12:30 a.m. The scene on Broadway, though, was hectic, according to Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin, as a group of protesters moved through the area and were followed by police. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, meanwhile, issued a statement on Twitter thanking those who kept their cool throughout the night. ""Thanks to all who’ve abided by the curfew,"" Fischer wrote. ""I am gratified to say that the majority of people are staying home. I want to thank all those who came out tonight and protested peacefully, expressing your concerns about the tragic death of Breonna Taylor."" • Midnight – The scene had cleared significantly at Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue at midnight, with officers taking a quick snack break after using gas and what appeared to be pellet guns to clear a group of protesters at the high-profile Louisville intersection. Back in the heart of the city, near Fourth and Guthrie streets, the owner of escape room Locked In stood out front of his business with a rifle to keep back protesters after the establishment's glass door had been shattered earlier.

The shooting was reported at 11:05 p.m. No other information was immediately available. • 11:30 p.m. – Many protesters left the corner of Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue and others were pushed further back at 11:20 p.m. by launching some kind of gas toward the crowd, which had gathered peacefully well after the 9 p.m. curfew. Police fired pepper ball guns at those who stayed at the scene, as Courier Journal reporter Matt Glowicki broadcast live on Facebook. Near the hospitals on Floyd Street, meanwhile, a crowd kept moving with police following them, The Courier Journal's Billy Kobin reported. The two sides had not physically clashed. Kobin said dozens of cars were in the crowd, with six police vehicles following. • 11 p.m. – The scene is tense in the Highlands. Armored trucks and a large police presence have taken the corner of Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue. Police fired pepper balls and what seemed to be pepper spray at protesters after someone in the crowd threw a water bottle at the officers, The Courier Journal's Olivia Krauth reported. Traffic has been blocked off at the intersection. Courier Journal reporter Matt Glowicki has footage from the scene. Police and protesters were still on the streets downtown as well. Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin reported a large crowd moving down Broadway, with police in the area as well. • 10:45 p.m. – In a 10:30 p.m. press briefing, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said the situation on the streets was ""still evolving"" and he hoped Sunday Louisville could come together peacefully and set an example for the rest of the country. Tear gas has been deployed, Fischer said, and about 10 people have been arrested, though a Metro Corrections spokesman said earlier that number was higher. The mayor also defended officers who destroyed water bottles and milk gallons that belonged to protesters, saying flammable liquids and other hazardous materials had been placed with the water and milk. Those materials needed to • 10:15 p.m. – Metro Corrections spokesman Tracy Dotson told The Courier Journal at least 25 to 30 arrests have taken place Saturday night, a much higher number than had occurred in the previous two nights of protests. Meanwhile, the scene had cleared near Sixth and Main streets, The Courier Journal's Billy Kobin reported, while separate groups of protesters marched in other areas downtown and in NuLu and the Highlands. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer will address reporters at 10:30 p.m., his office said. • 10 p.m. – Police have fired tear gas into the crowd at Jefferson Square. At least one protester was seen being detained on Sixth Street. Mounted police were showing up near the Republic Bank building downtown. Meanwhile, there was a throng of protesters at Bardstown Road and Baxter Avenue. Police were staged at a nearby Walgreens. SWAT officers were seen gathering near Baxter and Broadway. • 9:30 p.m. – Protesters in the Highlands have continued to try to make their point, even as National Guard personnel move into the region. Much of the crowd congregated near Bardstown Road and Grinstead Drive. Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth said many protesters stopped at the Wendy's near that corner and would not go past a National Guard truck that was in the parking lot. Down the street outside Cave Hill Cemetery, Courier Journal reporter Matt Glowicki spoke with Tracy Grizzle and her daughter Abby. They live in the Highlands and came out with signs to show support. She said the protest had been peaceful. ""They're telling us to leave, so we're trying to follow the rules,"" she said, as cars passed them and honked in support. ""All it is is we're trying to get our message out."" • 9:15 p.m. – Police have deployed tear gas downtown in various areas, including outside the judicial center, as Saturday night's protests get hotter. Law enforcement officials had previously smashed milk jugs and water bottle belonging to protesters downtown earlier in the day. The officers continued to work to break up groups of protesters around Jefferson Square. Charles Booker, who is running for the Democratic nomination to run for Mitch McConnell's Senate seat in November, shared a video of police breaking up protesters with green gas well before 9 p.m. • 9 p.m. – The crowd on Sixth Street was sparse at 9 p.m., when the Saturday night curfew was set to take place. Moments earlier, Courier Journal photojournalist Pat McDonogh said, police had broken up a crowd in the area. Protesters were spread widely at Sixth and Jefferson streets in the aftermath. The Highlands protest, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth, began to splinter around 9 p.m., after a group leader said the National Guard was blocks away. • 8:45 p.m. – Groups of protesters have once again taken to different areas in the city. Protesters on Liberty Street began to flee toward sunset after a few flashbangs when off in the area around 8:30 p.m. That's happened a few times tonight, according to Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin. Along Bardstown Road, according to The Courier Journal's Olivia Krauth, a march was taking place that was mostly peaceful. The group blocked the intersection of Baxter Avenue and Broadway to get their message across. That group of protesters, Courier Journal photojournalist Michael Clevenger said, has bounced around the region quite a bit. • 8:15 p.m. — The crowd of protesters outside Metro Hall is separating. State police have deployed green smoke and pepper balls. State police warned protesters over a speaker to peacefully disperse and warned that they may dispense ""chemical agents for unlawful assembly."" The curfew officially begins at 9 p.m. • 8 p.m. – State police and LMPD are advancing toward protests outside police headquarters and the Hall of Justice at Seventh and Jefferson streets. Meanwhile, police have blocked off Bardstown Road at Lucia, just west of Mid City Mall. • 7:40 p.m. – Law enforcement officers are taking away protesters' stockpiles of water and milk at Jefferson Square. A Ford pickup pulled up on the sidewalk, and plainclothes police officers began throwing the cases of water into the back of the truck and discarding the milk, which protesters use to combat the effects of tear gas. Officers in the area have put on their gas masks. I cannot believe what I just witnessed. They pulled up onto the square with a police siren on and did this. #Louisvillepic.twitter.com/65o2lgZCJh — Natalie Neysa Alund (@nataliealund) May 30, 2020 • 7 p.m. – A crowd of about 100 protesters at Broadway and Baxter Avenue had gathered and were making their way toward the Highlands just after 7 p.m. At Sixth and Jefferson streets in downtown Lousiville, meanwhile, where the most heated moments of Thursday's protest took place, a crowd of 250 or so people had arrived from Sixth Street, chanting and blocking some cars in the area. • 6:45 p.m. – A group of protesters from Louisville blocked the Second Street Bridge into Southern Indiana. About 400 demonstrators who had marched to the bridge next to the Yum Center from Jefferson Square stood across the roadway, turning cars away to head back north to the Hoosier State. The protesters left the bridge about 15 minutes later. • 6:30 p.m. – In a sitdown interview with The Courier Journal, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer asked protesters to make their feelings known before the 9 p.m. curfew hits Saturday night. A lot of people are upset right now, Fischer said, and that's ""totally understandable."" But the tone of the protests turned Friday night, he said, and the property damage and ""anarchic element"" that came to the forefront later in the evening led to an escalation that did not need to continue on Saturday. Fischer, who said he'd been on a call with 30 other mayors earlier in the day, had brought in the National Guard earlier to assist with Saturday's protest. Systematic change is needed, he said, but ""we don't want a further escalation tonight that could potentially endanger more people. Check out more from the interview below. CLOSE Mayor Greg Fischer talked about deploying the National Guard and other decisions made after two nights of protests over the death of Breonna Taylor. Louisville Courier Journal • 5:45 p.m. – A small protest in Jeffersonville, Indiana brought together demonstrators at the Big Four Bridge. Those in attendance want the Indiana State Police to release body cam footage taken on the night Malcolm Williams was shot and killed in April by a trooper, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth. And there were some tense moments. The group ran into a crowd of hecklers on the patio of Parlour Pizza, along with some families who left amid the commotion. Things ratcheted up a notch at one point when a man from the patio got on a motorcycle and tried to leave by driving through the crowd on a two-way street. Police were blocking streets with their cars on a rolling basis as protesters moved along but did not appear to have much of a presence on foot.

The curfew begins at 9 p.m. Saturday and Sunday and ends at 6:30 a.m. Sunday and Monday, and excludes people traveling for work, worship or for medical purposes. Those who violate the order could be cited and will be asked to return home. • About 350 National Guard members from Kentucky will be in Louisville on Saturday in response to the previous nights' protests, Fischer and Gov. Andy Beshear announced. • All TARC Louisville bus services will be suspended at 7 p.m. Saturday, the organization announced earlier in the afternoon, but routes will resume on Sunday. • Louisville's EMW Women's Clinic, the only abortion clinic in Kentucky, was damaged Friday night, according to a Twitter post from an account operated by clinic escorts. Friday night highlights For the second night in a row, angry protesters crowded the streets and sidewalks of downtown Louisville – setting fires, blocking traffic, breaking windows, burning flags and protesting the March death of Breonna Taylor, the unarmed black woman killed in her apartment by Louisville police. The Courier Journal had reporters and photographers across downtown, talking to protesters, snapping photos and capturing videos while monitoring the situation. Here's a recap: • 1:15 a.m. – An angered Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer thanked police officers for showing restraint at Friday's protest, and said he hears those who protested peacefully. But the damage done to downtown businesses, he said, was unacceptable. ""This is not a protest. It is violence,"" Fischer said in a livestream just after 1 a.m. ""… No one stands up for justice and equality by smashing windows and burning property. This destruction will not be tolerated."" • 12:50 a.m. – A large numbers of officers moved toward the CVS on Fourth Street at around 12:45 a.m. Someone appeared to be hurt by the broken glass at the convenience store, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth. Traffic around the block backed up, Courier Journal reporter Matt Mencarini said, as the person who was injured was taken out on a stretcher. Some protesters appeared to leave the building, which had every glass window broken, with bottles of alcohol or other merchandise. Elsewhere, protesters looting a store at the downtown Omni Louisville Hotel were shown on WLKY. • 12:40 a.m. – The Kentucky International Convention Center sustained ""major glass and exterior damage"" during Friday's protest, according to Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles. The building was evacuated, he said, and it was far from the only building in downtown Louisville to take damage during the protest. • 12:30 a.m. – Protesters made off with one of the Gallopalooza horse statues in downtown Louisville, footage that aired on WLKY showed. Still elsewhere, the scene had cooled. At approximately 12:20 a.m., a line of law enforcement officers that had been standing shoulder-to-shoulder for hours by Metro Hall were at ease for the time. Each was given a bottle of water from a police vehicle. A handful of protesters half a block away could be seen throwing trash away and collecting pallets of unused water bottles and styrofoam coolers with jugs of milk inside to be taken away at the park at Sixth and Jefferson streets. A fire burned a block away on Seventh Street. • 12:20 a.m. – Groups of protesters were spread out in downtown Louisville, but it appeared some of the crowds had dwindled, according to Courier Journal reporters Olivia Krauth and Matt Mencarini. With broken windows and overturned plants behind them, many protesters left downtown. Police remained on Fifth Street and at one point threw tear gas at reporters and very few protesters on an otherwise silent Fourth Street. Still, some protesters, and a large police force, remained at various points throughout downtown. • 12:10 a.m. – LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said she's positive that the larger crowd at Friday's protest is because more out-of-town residents have made the trip to Louisville. Local police have been tracking social media posts throughout the day, she said, and learned of buses coming to Louisville from Indianapolis. Officers had also seen a large number of cars in the crowd with license plates from out of town. “It’s been a high-profile conversation and obviously we use a lot of intelligence about what’s occurring,” Halladay said. “With an active social media platform we can see a lot of people traveled here for this tonight.” • Midnight – Some crowds began to disperse downtown, though crowds remained in other areas, and the protest in the Highlands appeared to wind down. Protesters who had marched south down Bardstown Road, according to Courier Journal photographer Sam Upshaw Jr., stopped at Eastern Parkway and chanted before turning around. Their protest was peaceful, Upshaw and other Courier Journal reporters in the area reported. Some came close to engaging with a line of officers in front of Mid City Mall but were turned away by other protesters with megaphones urging them to move on. • 11:35 p.m. – No arrests have taken place Friday night, LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said in an update to media members at 11:30 p.m., and police do not believe any shots have been fired. When asked about a rumor circulating among protesters that police had been given authorization to use lethal force, Halladay characterized it as an attempt to incite panic in the crowd and get a reaction, though she added officers ""are always authorized to use lethal force if they are confronted with lethal force and they fear for their safety or the safety of others."" ""We have been doing what we can do to use these less lethal options of tear gas and pepper ball because they can help disperse and we wouldn’t have to use lethal force,"" she said. • 11:30 p.m. – WHAS was forced to evacuate its downtown Louisville studio Friday night amid protests in the area. The network's Senait Gebregiorgis tweeted at 11:20 p.m. that the TV crew had to leave after protesters smashed windows at the building. No one was hurt, she said. WHAS's office is at 520 W. Chestnut Street, three blocks from Jefferson Street. Glass has been broken out of the front of the WHAS building facing Chestnut Street, Courier Journal visual journalist Jeff Faughender reported. Large glass panes were broken out, other windows had holes in them. Graffiti with phrases like ""Pigs fly,"" was spray painted on the windows. Protesters, meanwhile, jumped on a WLKY TV van downtown, the network showed. • 11:25 p.m. – Footage showed at least two people break into the Eddie Merlot's steakhouse at Fourth Street Live and leave through shattered windows with bottles of alcohol. Protesters on the popular Louisville parying block also burned a Confederate flag, amid cheers. Looting had not been an issue at Thursday's protest, Louisville police confirmed Thursday afternoon. And while vandalism had been reported at several businesses around town Friday night, looting had not yet been seen as a widespread issue at the Louisville protests. CLOSE Footage obtained by The Courier Journal shows protesters entering Eddie Merlot's amid protests Friday night. May 29, 2020 Louisville Courier Journal On Fourth Street, according to Courier Journal reporter Sarah Ladd, several stores’ windows and glass doors were shattered. A large bush burned at the bottom of the Fifth Third Bank building. Hard Rock Cafe's alarm rang as shattered glass spilled into the road. • 11:15 p.m. – WAVE 3 representatives declined to comment in the immediate aftermath of an incident in which it appeared a police officer shot what looked like pepper balls from a gun at a reporter and camera operator. The Courier Journal's Tessa Duvall reached out to the station and to Louisville police in following the incident, which aired live on TV and immediately went viral. Jessie Halladay, a spokeswoman for LMPD, said at 11:30 p.m. Friday that she had reviewed the video and said it was too difficult to tell who the officer was at this time. Halladay apologized, and said, it's ""not our intention to target or subject the media as they try to cover this."" Check out the full story, with the video, here. • 11:05 p.m. – A group of protesters were working their way down Bardstown Road just after 11 p.m. amid a busy night in Louisville. The crowd appeared to be largely peaceful, as police lined the streets and a helicopter took to the air above them. Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin said the protesters at Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue were young. They lined down the street toward the Speedway at the Grinstead Road intersection. • 11 p.m. – Fireworks were set off at the corner of Sixth and Jefferson streets moments earlier, and protests a block away at Sixth and Market had left a mark. Garbage cans that had been set on fire had melted into the street, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth. A Subway and Republic Bank were vandalized, and protesters and drivers confronted one another at various points. The site hasn't hosted especially large crowds for much of the night but had seen plenty of action. A line of police, though, moved around 11 p.m. from Metro Hall toward Sixth Street. They left the scene at Sixth and Market without issue, Krauth said. On Jefferson Street at about 11 p.m., teenagers and young people walked toward advancing police in riot gear who had previously deployed tear gas, and the police then halted their advance as the situation appeared to hit a standstill. Protesters unfurled a banner that said ""This will not continue."" • 10:40 p.m. – No shots have been fired at Friday night's protest, LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay told The Courier Journal at 10:35 p.m., and no significant injuries have been reported. Two arrests have taken place. • 10:30 p.m. – In front of Metro Hall, police appear to have made an effort to split up groups of protesters. Courier Journal reporter Mandy McLaren was at the scene for an hour and reported at least 100 people were in front of the building, the site of Thursday night's confrontation, at 10:30 p.m., with officers lined shoulder-to-shoulder near Fifth and Jefferson streets to prevent two separate groups of protesters (one of at least 50 people in front of the Chase Bank, the other closer to Metro Hall) from joining together. Tear gas was dispersed minutes later, at 10:40 p.m. Tensions arose earlier in front of the Hall of Justice around sundown before that crowd moved toward Metro Hall after being dispersed by officers. • 9:45 p.m. – A lively but peaceful evening was interrupted at sundown as police shoulder-to-shoulder in riot gear with face shields, gas masks, batons and other protective gear moved protesters down Jefferson Street toward Sixth Street. The police unit rolled up just before 9:30 p.m., a half-hour after protesters at the Hall of Justice pulled down American and Kentucky flags and set them ablaze. Moments later, some protesters threw objects at the building's glass doors, more items were lit on fire and three loud bangs went off. A group of more than 1,000 people were estimated to be gathering around the Hall of Justice where everything seems to be focused. Earlier coverage from Friday Groups of protesters demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, who was an African American woman killed in her apartment by police officers on March 13, gathered in downtown Louisville. Earlier in the day, the group which was more than 500 gathered at Jefferson Street with two helicopters circling overhead, including a LMPD chopper. The groups had speakers talking from the steps of Metro Hall. The crowd has continued to grow as the evening demonstrations carried on. Hundreds also knelt between Broadway and Jefferson Street with their fists are in the air and marched around the police department chanting, 'No justice no peace.' At least one protester was against banging on the glass of the Hall of Justice steps. Protesters were also seen banging on glass at Hall of Justice steps calling for officers to come outside.

LMPD arrested and charged an Owensboro resident, 25-year-old Adair Henderson, with disorderly conduct and failure to disperse, according to an arrest citation. The offense of first-degree disorderly conduct is a Class A misdemeanor in Kentucky that is punishable by 90 days to one year in jail and a maximum $500 fine. Failure to to disperse is a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a maximum $250 fine. Stephanie Garvin and David Wheatley, both of Louisville, were also booked into Metro Corrections about 2 a.m. Friday and each charged with first-degree criminal mischief and first-degree riot, court records show. Garvin, 28, was seen by officers and captured on surveillance footage busting out the windows of a Metro Corrections van and throwing objects at the Metro Corrections building, according to her arrest citation. Wheatley, 27, was also seen breaking out the window of a Metro Corrections van and busting a window on the side of the Metro Corrections building, according to his citation. The charges of first-degree riot and first-degree criminal mischief are both Class D felonies in Kentucky, which are punishable by one to five years in prison. Louisville mayor: No-knock warrants will be suspended Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said Friday morning that five of the shooting victims from the protest are in ""good condition"" and that the two victims who required surgery are now ""stable and recovering."" The mayor also said that he is suspending the use of no-knock warrants by police and that all officers will now be required to wear body cameras while executing search warrants. Fischer said the gunfire that wounded seven people ""came from within the crowd, not from officers."" LMPD Assistant Chief of Police LaVita Chavous said LMPD has ""no leads on the shooter"" but is continuing to investigate. Two LMPD officers were also taken to the hospital with chest pains ""spurred"" by the protest, Chavous said, with one officer remaining in the hospital overnight before getting released. 'It is not a riot. It is a revolt': Councilwoman responds to Breonna Taylor protest The mayor mentioned damage to vehicles and statues. Protesters tore off the right hand of the King Louis XVI statue that stands on a pedestal at Sixth and Jefferson streets. After shots were fired in the crowd, officers deployed tear gas, pepper ball and smoke grenades ""after several verbal warnings were given ordering people to disperse,"" Washington said. ""Contrary to what you may have heard, LMPD does not utilize rubber bullets,"" Washington added. ""Pepper balls are similar to paint balls and often time leave welts on a person’s body after being struck."" Chavous would not disclose how many officers were on hand for Thursday's protest. When and where did the Thursday protest start? The gathering began as early as 6 or 7 p.m. and stretched past midnight. Crowds moved from outside City Hall on Sixth Street to in front of the KFC Yum Center, where more police officers began to engage with the crowd. As heavy rains moved into the area in the early morning hours, much of the crowd dispersed. How many protesters were there? An estimated 500 to 600 protesters gathered in the streets of downtown Louisville. The initially peaceful protest escalated as the night drew on, with the crowd being teargassed and glass storefronts shattered. By 10 p.m., at least one group could be seen verbally clashing with police officers near the Yum Center. The officers carried wooden batons and were wearing body armor and face shields. An armored truck was stationed nearby. It is unknown how many officers were called in to the protest. At one point, protesters threw things at police officers and kicked a patrol car. When one officer was surrounded by protesters near Bearno's by the Bridge, a pizza parlor near the Second Street bridge and the Yum Center, protest organizers stepped in to make sure the officer was not harmed.

May 28, 2020 (Photo: Pat McDonogh / Courier Journal) Around 11 p.m., a line of officers advanced down East Main Street, dispersing a large crowd. But not long after, hundreds congregated a few blocks south again in front of Metro Hall, where a group of protesters had been trying to tip an armored vehicle, breaking its windows and slashing its tires. Just before 11:30 p.m., multiple rounds of gunfire then rang out near Sixth and Jefferson streets. At least seven wounded victims were seen being carried away on stretchers. LMPD later confirmed that seven people had been shot and two required surgery. Who fired the shots? Who was arrested? LMPD said its officers did not fire their guns. As Chavous noted Friday morning, LMPD has ""no leads on the shooter,"" but the department's homicide unit is continuing to investigate. Apart from the Owensboro resident charged with disorderly conduct, police said several individuals were booked into Louisville Metro Corrections, with jail records indicating charges of first-degree riot and first-degree criminal mischief. Louisville mayor: 'Answering violence with violence' not the answer to Taylor death Why was there a protest? The death of Taylor, who was fatally shot March 13 by LMPD officers in her southwest Louisville apartment, was the main issue on the minds of protesters. Taylor's case has gained national and international attention in recent weeks as more information came to light on how police forced their way into her apartment as part of a narcotics investigation. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he and Taylor were scared and unsure of who was trying to gain entry to the apartment that night, while the officers have claimed they announced themselves several times. After officers used a battering ram to force their way into the apartment on Springfield Drive, Walker fired one shot that he says was in self-defense before the three officers responded with a hail of bullets, hitting Taylor eight times. No drugs were found inside Taylor's apartment. The FBI and Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron have since announced separate reviews of Taylor's death and the actions of the LMPD officers. Was the protest also about George Floyd? As mentioned, protesters focused mainly on calling for justice in Taylor's death. But the protests in Louisville unfurled as other cities saw similar demonstrations over police killings of black Americans, including in Phoenix, Denver and Minneapolis, where a man named George Floyd died after a white officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck. Floyd's death this week was captured on camera. That footage, coupled with how a transcript of a 911 call revealed that a clerk had accused Floyd of buying cigarettes with fake money, ignited protests around the country. Ben Crump, the Florida-based attorney representing Taylor's family, appeared Friday morning on MSNBC and called the recent, high-profile killings of black Americans “a national pandemic that’s affecting all African Americans.” “It is a state of emergency,” he said. What did Taylor's family and others say? As the situation in downtown Louisville escalated, Taylor's family took to social media to plead for peace. ""We are not going to stop until we get justice,"" Juniyah Palmer, Taylor's younger sister, said in a video. ""But we should stop tonight before people get hurt."" And during a Friday appearance on CNN, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read a statement from Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer: ""Breonna devoted her own life to saving other lives, to helping others, to making people smile, and to bringing people together. The last thing she’d want right now is any more violence. Changes are being made, but it’s not enough. We will not stop until there is truth, justice and accountability. Breonna’s legacy will not be forgotten. And it’s because of all of us saying her name and demanding justice. We are saying her name more each day. Thank you. Please keep saying her name. Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let’s do it the right way without hurting each other. We can, and we will make some real change here. Now’s the time. Let’s make it happen."" How many protesters were there Thursday? An estimated 500 to 600 protesters gathered in the streets of downtown Louisville for several hours. The gathering began as early as 6 or 7 p.m. and stretched past midnight. Where did it take place Thursday? Crowds moved from outside City Hall on Sixth Street to in front of the KFC Yum Center, where more police officers began to engage with the crowd. This story will be updated.

(Photo: Photo courtesy of the Floyd family) Multiple local protests have been scheduled over the next few days over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee in Minneapolis. In a public Facebook group called Outraged and Organized, group members have said that they will meet at the Hamilton County Courthouse at 6 p.m. on Friday night. In the group, members discussed ways to maintain social distance while protesting. There is what is being called a Peaceful Protest at Washington Park at noon on Saturday. ""This is intended to be a peaceful showing of solidarity amongst the people that feel like these incidents are wrong. Everyone is invited,"" according to a post. Organizers suggest wearing masks and gloves. A Facebook event says organizers are planning a “Be Heard, Be Safe; Rally for Justice” that will begin at Fountain Square at 3 p.m. Sunday, May 31. “Following the awful events that led to the death of another unarmed black man, a city is burning. This is Cincinnati's chance to join our fellow outraged Americans in a SAFE AND HEALTH CONSCIOUS way,” the post says. [The Enquirer is providing most of its coronavirus-related stories free to readers. We can’t do this work without your support.

This is a peaceful demonstration and is expected to be respected. Details are still forming so stay tuned and please spread the word.” Two organizers indicated they would comment soon. Protesters to kneel at courthouse Monday A notice on an Instagram account says a protest will be held at 1 p.m. Monday, June 1, at the Hamilton County Courthouse on Main Street. “We will be honoring George Floyd and every black life lost at the hands of this corrupt system,” the notice says. “In honor of George we will be kneeling for 10 minutes, the duration of his murder.” That’s a reference to the fact that a white police officer used his knee to hold Floyd, a 46-year-old black man being arrested on Monday, by his neck to the ground. “Join us in a peaceful protest against the racist injustices and police brutality that plague America,” the notice says. The creator of the Instagram account did not respond to a request for comment. Lt. Steve Saunders, spokesman for the Cincinnati Police Department, declined comment on the protests. Cincinnati Black Lives Matter March On Sunday, June 7, there will be a Cincinnati Black Lives Matter March at Fountain Square at 1 p.m. ""We are going to meet at Fountain square and march to the Hamilton county courthouse on 1000 Main Street and then circle around the building so we are heard,"" the Facebook event states. The event encourages people to keep social distancing in mind and asks that people wear face masks and stay in small groups, no larger than 10 people. The page also encourages different groups to maintain a six foot distance. Hamilton County Commissioner Denise Driehaus.

Mayor Greg Fischer is appealing for calm on the streets following protests in downtown Louisville Thursday night. The protest moved through downtown for several hours and was largely peaceful, until gunfire rang out and seven people were wounded late in the evening. The demonstration attracted hundreds of people and was in response to the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor during a drug raid conducted by LMPD officers in March. On Friday morning, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said five of the seven wounded were treated at the scene, and two were taken into surgery. All are currently in stable condition, he said. Two police officers were taken to the hospital with chest pains, according to Louisville Metro Police Assistant Chief LaVita Chavous. Three people have been arrested in connection the demonstration, but police say they have no leads in connection with the shootings. Chavous said the department did not deploy tear gas until after protestors began to vandalize private and public property, and gunshots were fired. According to Mayor Fischer, no officers fired their weapons. “We value the right to free speech and understand this community has a lot to say right now,” Chavous said. “We will not tolerate violence that leads to people being hurt. We will not tolerate the destruction of our beautiful city.” With more protests planned for this weekend, Chavous said time off has been cancelled for all officers. She said LMPD is working on a response plan that could involve calling in additional officers from neighboring police departments. Fischer called for an end to the violence. “The fight for justice cannot be won with guns and vandalism,” he said. “It can only be won with persistence and commitment to the shared goal of creating a city of peace, safety, equality and justice for everyone.” He read a statement from Breonna Taylor’s family that expressed the same sentiment. “The last thing that she would want to see right now is any more violence,” Fischer read. “Changes are being made. It’s not enough. It will not stop until there’s truth, justice and accountability.” Taylor, a 26-year-old ER technician, was killed by LMPD officers in her home on March 13. Officers were serving a “no-knock” warrant just after midnight. A lawsuit filed by the family alleges that the police did not identify themselves. Related Story 911 Call In Shooting Death Of Breonna Taylor Released Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, has said through his attorney he fired a warning shot at police in self-defense. He claims he did not know who was entering the apartment. His shot hit one of the officers. Police fired back, hitting Taylor at least eight times. Since Taylor’s death made national news, the police chief has announced his retirement and the department has suspended the use of no-knock warrants while the policy is under review. The city also created a committee to consider creation of a Civilian Review Board for the police department, which has its first meeting on Friday. Thursday night’s protests coincided with similar protests in Minneapolis over the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died while in police custody. Protestors took over and burned a Minneapolis Police Department precinct station and dozens of businesses were looted in Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul. U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-KY, issued a statement Friday afternoon, saying the killings of Taylor, Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have “shaken our nation.” According to the statement, “these tragedies do not appear as isolated incidents, but as the latest disturbing chapters in our long, unfinished American struggle to ensure that equal justice under law is not conditional on the color of one’s skin.” McConnell said he is glad Metro Police are investigating Taylor’s death, that the FBI is involved and that Kentucky’s attorney general will evaluate actions that may be necessary. McConnell also condemned Thursday night’s violence in Louisville and elsewhere. “Stealing, burning down buildings, attacking law enforcement officers, or laying siege to police precincts is not speech or protest. It is violent crime that victimizes innocent people,” the statement said. Earlier Friday, Gov. Andy Beshear responded to the protest in a tweet. “My heart aches for Louisville & our country. Breonna Taylor’s family & the public deserve the truth. We should honor Breonna’s legacy as an EMT & the pursuit of the truth should not be marred by violence.”",0.0

Mitch McConnell noting ""these tragedies do not appear as isolated incidents."" McConnell, R-Ky., released an afternoon statement saying the killings of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, George Floyd in Minneapolis and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia ""have shaken our nation"" ""For millions and millions of outraged Americans, these tragedies do not appear as isolated incidents, but as the latest disturbing chapters in our long, unfinished American struggle to ensure that equal justice under law is not conditional on the color of one’s skin,"" McConnell stated. McConnell expressed support for the investigations into Taylor's death and said her family members ""deserve truth, accountability, and justice,"" but decried the violence that took place in Louisville and Minneapolis Thursday night. ""Stealing, burning down buildings, attacking law enforcement officers, or laying siege to police precincts is not speech or protest,"" McConnell stated. ""It is violent crime that victimizes innocent people. Kentuckians cannot and will not accept violence and chaos on our streets."" Also: Mayor Fischer suspends no-knock warrants, telling Breonna Taylor protesters 'I hear you' Hundreds of protesters marched through the streets of Louisville Thursday night demanding justice for Taylor, who in March was shot and killed in by Louisville police officers who busted into her apartment on a ""no knock"" warrant. Late into the protest, a group tried to tip an LMPD armored vehicle, breaking its windows and slashing its tires, after which multiple gunshots rang out. Seven people ended up shot. LMPD put out a statement early Friday morning saying none of its officers fired their guns. LMPD announced late Friday morning that it had no leads on who fired the gunshots. Louisville Metro Council members in a joint statement said that the peaceful protest that began the evening was ""sadly overshadowed by the nonsensical destruction and shootings of seven more Louisvillians."" ""The message was kidnapped by the actions of some who chose to voice those concerns through violence,"" the statement said. ""As we move toward justice for Breonna, let us work to be part of the solution and needed change."" ""Breonna lived to save lives, so surely, she would not want further violence to be associated with our call for justice,"" it added. U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth of Louisville also reacted on Friday to the chaos and violence that capped off the protest in downtown Louisville. ""Last night was tough for us all,"" Yarmuth tweeted. ""Heartbroken to see gunfire erupt during otherwise peaceful protests here in Louisville."" Last night was tough for us all. Heartbroken to see gunfire erupt during otherwise peaceful protests here in Louisville. Angered by the President outright fanning the flames and inciting violence against protestors in MN (or anywhere.) I pray that justice and order will prevail. — Rep. John Yarmuth (@RepJohnYarmuth) May 29, 2020 Also Friday morning, Gov. Andy Beshear tweeted out a statement from Tamika Palmer, the mother of Taylor, that urged avoiding violence as they demand accountability for her death. ""Breonna Taylor’s family & the public deserve the truth,"" Beshear tweeted. ""We should honor Breonna’s legacy as an EMT & the pursuit of the truth should not be marred by violence."" LISTEN: Courier Journal's Cameron Teague Robinson shares what he saw at Breonna Taylor protest Beshear, a Democrat, also appeared on CNN Friday morning to repeat Palmer's words, saying what had been a peaceful protest unfortunately turned violent late into the night. ""I believe that some other folks, very late, more than three hours in, came in and ultimately instigated and caused some actions that turned it into something that it should not have been,"" Beshear said. Beshear also addressed the protest in his daily press conference Friday, adding that Louisville is ""a city where we can see the impacts and the vestiges of slavery, of segregation, of Jim Crow. And it’s almost that it occurs on a specific street."" Later in the press conference, he added: ""I can't pretend to understand the level of frustration, fatigue, that people must feel with hundreds of years of inequality. ... To see videos of someone putting their knee on someone else's throat while they cry out for help and nobody does anything about it. I can't pretend to know how that feels. I can commit to listen. Being the governor ... I can commit to doing everything I can in our system to help."" Protests and violence also continued in Minneapolis over the death of Floyd, a black man killed in police custody after a white officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee. CLOSE Multiple gunshots ring out as protesters attempt to overturn a police vehicle in front of Louisville Metro Hall on West Jefferson in downtown Louisville. Louisville Courier Journal Yarmuth, a Democrat, also reacted to a tweet from President Donald Trump early Friday morning, who called those behind looting and violence in Minneapolis ""THUGS"" and added ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" ""Angered by the President outright fanning the flames and inciting violence against protestors in MN (or anywhere.) I pray that justice and order will prevail,"" Yarmuth tweeted. Twitter did not delete Trump's tweet but added a disclaimer to it stating: ""This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible."" On CNN, Beshear also called on Trump to retract his tweet, saying elected officials have a responsibility ""not just to maintain the peace, which is what we ought to be doing, but to also listen, to show empathy, and to try to find a way to move in the right direction, not the wrong one."" Louisville mayor: 'Answering violence with violence' not the answer to Breonna Taylor death Trump stood by the tweet and addressed the seven people shot in Louisville in a Friday afternoon tweet. Looting leads to shooting, and that’s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2020 ""Looting leads to shooting, and that’s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot,"" Trump tweeted. ""I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means. It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement."" There were no reports of looting in Louisville. The police department says it does not know who fired the shots but says no officers fired their weapons during the protest. Yarmuth went on to tweet that the deaths of Taylor and Floyd ""and all other manifestations of racism are as poisonous as COVID-19."" ""In America, racism is as old as time, but it is past time for all elected officials to raise their voices in a deafening chorus against racism in our justice system."" Asked about Trump's tweets at a Friday morning press conference in Kentucky, McConnell declined to comment. “I generally don't comment on the President's tweets,"" McConnell said. ""I can speak for myself."" McConnell also said the Minneapolis police officers involved in the death of Floyd ""look pretty darn guilty."" In Kentucky, the state FOP said the Breonna Taylor protests on Thursday showcased Louisville Metro Police officers' ""professionalism and dedication to their city and fellow citizens,"" praising them while criticizing decisions made by city leadership. ""Officers were surrounded during several encounters and eventually debris and other objects, including fireworks, were used as weapons targeting police,"" wrote FOP President Berl Perdue. ""This is unacceptable. Mayor Greg Fischer and Chief Steve Conrad have once again shown their failure to maintain order and safety in our city. Officers were told at numerous turns to stand down."" Kentucky House and Senate Democratic Leaders Joni Jenkins and Morgan McGarvey said in a statement that ""(w)e need listening, understanding, trust, and inclusion from every institution in our lives."" ""The names of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and countless others must never be forgotten, and it is equally vital that we build on their legacy with love, accountability and justice,"" Jenkins and McGarvey said. ""We can do that without violence and without hate. This is the challenge of our lifetime."" This story may updated. Reporters Billy Kobin and Darcy Costello contributed to this report.

1620318340,2020-05-29 11:29:05,"Mayor Fischer suspends no-knock warrants, telling Breonna Taylor protesters 'I hear you'",http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625514860/0/courierjournal/home~Mayor-Fischer-suspends-noknock-warrants-telling-Breonna-Taylor-protesters-I-hear-you/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The morning after a large protest swept across downtown Louisville streets, demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, Mayor Greg Fischer announced no-knock warrants will be temporarily suspended, telling protesters ""I hear you."" Fischer, who pleaded for peaceful protests, also signaled he would call for a civilian review board over Louisville Metro Police with subpoena powers — another change that activists have called for in the wake of Taylor's death. ""These changes and more to come — we're not done — should signal that I hear the community. We will continue to make improvements anywhere that we can. Breonna Taylor's name and her story will now be part of our city's history,"" he said. ""But as Breonna's family shared last night, answering violence with violence only makes things worse."" What began as a peaceful protest demanding justice for Taylor — starting just hours after her boyfriend's frantic 911 call from the aftermath of her death was released to the public — escalated as the night drew on. The crowd was teargassed by police, an LMPD vehicle nearly overturned and glass storefronts shattered. At least seven people were shot, and one remains in critical condition. Fischer and police officials have said the investigation into the shooting is ongoing, and no one has been arrested, but they stressed that no LMPD officers fired their weapons during the protest. Two officers were taken to the hospital with chest pains, said LaVita Chavous, LMPD's assistant chief of police. 'No justice, no peace': 7 people shot amid Louisville protests for Breonna Taylor Taylor, 26, a Louisville ER tech, was killed in the early morning hours of March 13 after officers executed a no-knock search warrant in connection with a narcotics investigation at her home. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, has said he fired one shot as officers entered the home, not realizing that they were police. He struck Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly in the femoral artery. Walker was originally charged with attempted murder of a police officer in connection with the event, but charges against him were dismissed last week by the commonwealth's attorney, who called for more investigation. Taylor was shot to death by police in their return fire. No drugs were recovered from the home. Neither Taylor nor Walker had previous drug-related criminal charges or convictions. Many protesters have called for the officers involved in her shooting — named by LMPD as Mattingly, Officer Brett Hankison and Officer Myles Cosgrove — to be fired. Fischer didn't announce any new developments in their case Friday. He has said his administration turned over the police department's internal investigation into the shooting to the state attorney general, who will determine whether the officers' conduct warrants criminal charges. He also sent the findings to the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI, which has since announced it opened its own independent investigation. What we know: 7 shot in downtown Louisville at Breonna Taylor protest Fischer said Friday he wanted to ""work together as a community to prevent further tragedies."" And he pleaded with protesters to peacefully demonstrate, reading aloud a statement from Taylor's family that said the ""last thing"" Taylor would want to see is ""any more violence."" ""We will not stop until there's truth, justice and accountability,"" the statement said. ""Breonna's legacy will not be forgotten."" But, it added, let's keep ""demanding justice"" without hurting one another. ""We can and we will make some real change here,"" it said. ""Now's the time. Let's make it happen — safely."" Backlash to no-knock warrants No-knock warrants have become an especially controversial topic in recent weeks after it was revealed that Louisville police obtained a search warrant with a no-knock clause for Taylor’s apartment the night she died. Police planned to search Taylor’s southwest Louisville apartment as a part of a larger narcotics investigation, of which Taylor was not the main target. Court records show that at least five warrants with no-knock clauses were signed by Circuit Judge Mary Shaw for the night Taylor died: Taylor's apartment on Springfield Drive, a suspected drug house in the Russell neighborhood on Elliott Avenue, two vacant homes nearby on Elliott Avenue, and a suspected stash house on West Muhammad Ali Boulevard. The warrant for the Muhammad Ali Boulevard house was not executed, court records show, though police did not specify why. The warrants for Taylor's apartment and Elliott Avenue were carried out at nearly the exact same time. At Taylor's apartment that morning, police have said officers knocked and announced themselves prior to entering with a battering ram. Earlier: Pressure grows for Louisville to ban no-knock warrants afte shooting CLOSE Commonwealth’s Attorney Tom Wine announced his office will move to dismiss all charges against Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend. Louisville Courier Journal A snippet of a police interview played by Commonwealth's Attorney Tom Wine included Mattingly, the sergeant who was injured in the raid, describing how officers got in place and banged on the door. ""We didn't announce the first couple because our intent was not to hit the door,"" Mattingly said. ""Our intent was to give her plenty of time to come to the door because she was probably there alone."" Mattingly banged on the door. No response, he said. He banged again, and still got no response. ""At that point we start announcing ourselves,"" he said. ""'Police! Please come to the door. Police! We have a search warrant.'"" Attorneys for Taylor’s family cited multiple neighbors who said officers did not knock and announce themselves. Rob Eggert, Walker’s defense attorney, said Walker only fired his shot because he did not know that it was police on the other side of the door. Inside the apartment, according to police interviews with Walker that Wine played, Walker and Taylor had no idea it was police outside. He told investigators he initially thought it might have been a former boyfriend of Taylor’s, but there was no response when Taylor twice called out, “Who is it?” Then, Walker said he grabbed his gun, ""scared to death."" Taylor yelled again ""at the top of her lungs,"" asking who it was, Walker said in the recording. He said he was asking, too, at that point. Hear the 911 call: 'Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend' They got out of bed and were going toward the door when it “comes off its hinges” and Walker fired one shot, still unable to see, he told police. Then, gunfire. Spokeswomen for Fischer did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent Friday about how long no-knock warrants would be suspended in Louisville or what the goal is before they resume. An ordinance filed in the Metro Council would restrict their use — barring them in cases in which drug possession is the only suspected crime — and add additional monitors. The sponsors have said they are open to amendments strengthening the language to even more stringently limit the types of cases in which no-knock warrants could be sought. The legislation is expected to be discussed at a Wednesday Public Safety Committee meeting. Related: Are more protests planned over Breonna Taylor's shooting?

1620318338,2020-05-29 13:49:43,Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin arrested in George Floyd's death: Updates,http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625487452/0/courierjournal/home~Former-Minneapolis-police-officer-Derek-Chauvin-arrested-in-George-Floyds-death-Updates/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS – Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was arrested Friday, days after video circulated of him holding his knee to George Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes before Floyd died. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Freeman said. Floyd's family released a statement following the arrest, calling it a ""welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."" The family said they wanted to see Chauvin charged with first-degree murder, as well as charges for the three other officers. The arrest comes after Minneapolis residents awoke Friday to smoke billowing, fires burning and police lining their streets after another intense night of protests following Floyd's death. Protests, some violent, also cropped up across the nation and are continuing in many cities Friday night. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Stay up-to-date on the George Floyd story by signing up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing. Here are the latest developments: Vice President Joe Biden said he spoke with Floyd’s family: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" Floyd and Chauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter - they worked together at a bar, a city official and a bar owner said. Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, their attorney Ben Crump says. President Donald Trump criticized the city's mayor, called protesters ""thugs"" and said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Twitter later put a public interest notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about ""glorifying violence."" A CNN reporter and crew were arrested early Friday and later released. Protests and rallies took place across the country overnight. In Louisville, Kentucky, a protest to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March, turned violent. Seven people were shot but are expected to recover. Here's what we know Friday: More protests sweep the nation after Chauvin's arrest Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital?"" he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to name a few places, also continued. Minneapolis, Saint Paul face curfews In response to ""widespread civil unrest and unlawful activity"" in the city over recent nights, Gov. Tim Walz, along with the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, imposed a nighttime curfew on all public places in the Twin Cities, including streets and roads, alleys, highways, driveways, sidewalks, parks and more. The curfew goes into effect Friday at 8 p.m. until 6 a.m., then again at the same time Saturday night. According to the emergency order, all law enforcement, fire and medical personnel, news media and other city and state officials were exempt from the curfew, along with people seeking care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness. Violation of the order would result in a misdemeanor offense and is punishable by a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to 90 days, according to the order. The mayor of bordering Roseville announced on Twitter that, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" he had also imposed a curfew. County attorney says Chauvin facing murder, manslaughter charges Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that his office was still reviewing evidence in Floyd's death but they have ""sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt"" on both a third-degree murder and a manslaughter charge. Freeman said the charges were similar to those filed against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the shooting death of Justine Damond. Asked why Chauvin was not arrested and held before charges filed, Freeman said, ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer."" Freeman would not comment on what specific piece of evidence led to Chauvin's arrest but said that his office had reviewed footage of Floyd's death and the officer's body-worn camera, spoken to witnesses and obtained a preliminary report from the medical examiner. ""We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need. Even as late as yesterday afternoon, we didn't have all that we needed,"" Freeman said. Freeman said he would not speculate about the three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest but said he anticipates charges. Complaint provides new details from body cam footage A criminal complaint that references body-worn cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds some additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. The complaint lines up with what many nationwide have seen in video of the incident and adds context for what other officers at the scene were doing. One officer on the scene expressed worry for Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if Floyd should be rolled onto his side. After Floyd became unresponsive, an officer checked for a pulse and said he didn't find one, according to the complaint. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for an additional two minutes after that, according to the complaint. The report adds the type of restraint Chauvin used ""with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" Read more about the complaint here. Family seeks first-degree murder charge The family of George Floyd released a statement Friday calling for officials to revise the charges against Chauvin. ""We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,"" the statement said. ""We call on authorities to revise the charges to reflect the true culpability of this officer."" Activists echoed the call, saying that one arrest was not enough. At a press conference inside Minneapolis city hall, attended by former NBA player Stephen Jackson and actor Jamie Foxx, community members called for the arrest of all four officers involved in the incident. ""We are not satisfied with one officer,"" said lawyer and minister Nekima Levy Armstrong. ""All of them were complicit in his murder, and they all need to (be) held accountable, just as if it was four black men that killed somebody."" Barr says federal investigation 'proceeding quickly' Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is ""proceeding quickly"" with its investigation on Floyd's death. ""The video images of the incident that ended with death of Mr. Floyd, while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, were harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing,"" Barr said Friday. The Justice Department has launched a parallel investigation on whether the officers committed civil rights violations. Barr said state officials will first make charging decisions before the Justice Department does. – Kristine Phillips Biden, Obama speak out Former Vice President Joe Biden, in a video address Friday, said he spoke with George Floyd’s family, saying, ""It's time for us to take a hard look at the uncomfortable truths. It's time for us to face that deep open wound in this nation."" Added Biden: ""With our complacency and silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence."" In a statement, former President Barack Obama said he, his friends and millions of other Americans share ""anguish"" after Floyd's death. While it's natural to want the U.S. to return to ""normal"" amid the coronavirus, Obama said ""normal"" for many Americans is ""being treated differently on account of race."" ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America. It can't be 'normal,' "" he added. ""If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" The protest:What one reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper spray Minnesota Gov. Walz: 'It's time for us to clean our streets' Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called on the public to end violent protests and looting that take away peaceful demonstrations honoring Floyd. ""As we put a presence in the street to restore order, it is to open that space to seek justice and heal after what happened,"" Walz said at a news conference. Walz addressed criticism about a lack of police presence overnight during the protests, saying that the local leadership needed to make specific requests as to the mission for state troopers and national guard members. ""You will not see that tonight,"" Walz said. ""There was no social control. ... That is an abject failure that cannot happen."" ""The chapter that has been written this week is one of our darkest chapters,"" Walz said. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison echoed the governor's message of addressing structural problems within policing in the state, adding that prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest alone will not lead to justice. ""We're not just going to fix the windows and sweep up the glass,"" he said. ""We're going to fix a broken society."" Floyd, Chauvin worked security at same bar Floyd andChauvin knew each other before the fatal encounter during which Chauvin held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes as Floyd said he could not breathe, a city official and a bar owner said. Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins told CNN and MSNBC that Floyd and Chauvin were long-time co-workers who worked security at the same bar, El Nuevo Rodeo. Speaking with KSTP-TV, former bar owner Maya Santamaria said Chauvin worked off-duty security outside for 17 years while Floyd worked inside the bar. Santamaria said she sold the club a few months ago. More on Derek Chauvin:Minneapolis police at center of George Floyd’s death had a history of complaints Floyd's family arranges independent autopsy George Floyd's family has hired a medical examiner to conduct an independent autopsy, the family’s lawyer said Friday. “We’ve just spoken recently with the district attorney,” attorney Ben Crump said in a press conference. “We’re going to take custody back of his body, and we’re bringing in Dr. Michael Baden to perform an independent autopsy.” Crump said the family suspected city authorities of trying to establish a false narrative through the autopsy report. The preliminary autopsy report found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the criminal complaint released Friday. “The family does not trust anything coming from the Minneapolis Police Department. How can they?” Crump said. Baden is a forensic pathologist known for investigation high-profile deaths, including that of Jeffrey Epstein. Baden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Also Friday, the families of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Floyd issued a joint call for a congressional hearing and a national task force aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability in the U.S. “While we are grateful for the outpouring of love and support, it’s important that now – more than ever – we use our voices to enact change, demand accountability within our justice system and keep the legacies of Breonna, Ahmaud and George alive,” the families said in a joint statement. George Floyd video adds to trauma:'When is the last time you saw a white person killed online?' More news on the police death of George Floyd CNN reporter Omar Jimenez and crew released after being arrested Gov. Tim Walz apologized Friday for the arrest of a CNN reporter and crew. ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen,"" he said. Correspondent Omar Jimenez was reporting live on ""New Day"" when police advanced toward him and his crew. Jimenez told police that he was a reporter, showed his credentials and asked where they would like him and the crew to stand so they could continue reporting and be out of their way. ""Put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way,"" Jimenez said. ""Wherever you want us, we will go. We were just getting out of your way when you were advancing through the intersection."" A response by police could not be heard as Jimenez explained the scene. An officer then told Jimenez he was under arrest. Jimenez asked why he was under arrest, but was taken from the scene. The rest of the crew was then arrested as the live shot continued with the camera on the ground. CNN said later Friday that Jimenez had been released and that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for his arrest. ""There was a moment, minutes after it happened where things started to sink in a little bit,"" Jimenez said on CNN after his release. ""I was just as confused as you."" ""They eventually came back with our belongings ... unclipped our handcuffs and that is when we were led out,"" he said, adding, ""There was no, 'Sorry, this is a big misunderstanding.' "" Protest erupted in Louisville with 7 shot overnight At least seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her apartment while sleeping. Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Taylor – one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks. It began as a peaceful demonstration with several hundred people marching through downtown, chanting Taylor's name and calling for the officers involved in her death to face charges. But as the sun set, tensions rose. Police in riot gear clashed with hundreds of protesters outside of Louisville Metro Hall, officers releasing clouds of tear gas and firing a barrage of rubber bullets at the crowd. By the end of the evening, dozens of vehicles and buildings had sustained property damage. Crowds shook a police prisoner transport van, nearly toppling it. As of Friday afternoon, the police department said there were no leads in the case. – Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd Breonna Taylor shooting:What to know about the FBI, Louisville police investigations Contributing: Associated Press; Jordan Culver, Joel Shannon, Erick Smith, Savannah Behrmann, Cara Richardson, Steve Kiggins and Heather Tucker, USA TODAY; Tyler J.

""Moving forward, we understand there are several additional protests planned for today and over the weekend,"" Louisville Metro Police spokesman Lamont Washington said in a statement Friday. According to posts on social media, one gathering is asking attendees to meet outside the Muhammad Ali Center at 8:30 p.m. Friday ""for instructions,"" while another march is planned to start at 6:30 p.m. in NuLu at the AC Hotel by Louisville Marriott Downtown. In addition, a coalition of Louisville groups that has held downtown demonstrations every Friday for the past two months to call for the release of inmates from jails and prisons amid the coronavirus pandemic say they will focus on ""Justice for Breonna"" this week. The weekly ""Freedom Fridays Caravan"" has featured cars and bicyclists looping around the Hall of Justice, Metro Corrections, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field office and City Hall for roughly 30 minutes. LMPD Assistant Chief of Police LaVita Chavous said Friday that officers will not have any off days this weekend. And Chavous added that while the city has no plans on calling in the National Guard, it is considering bringing in ""other agencies of Louisville to help us."" Chavous said LMPD will have a plan at the ready should it need to respond to any upcoming protests. Washington, the LMPD spokesman, reiterated that ""our goal will be to allow for the peaceful expression of protest."" ""We value the right to free speech and understand this community has a lot to say right now. We will not tolerate violence that leads to people being hurt or destruction of our beautiful city,"" Washington said. ""We are prepared to take what action we must to try to ensure no one else is injured during this time of unrest. We ask the community to please voice your opinions in a peaceful way."" The expected continuation of downtown protests has already resulted in TARC announcing changes to bus stops along certain routes. Beginning at 2 p.m. Friday and ""until further notice,"" TARC said all stops for routes traveling between Market Street and Muhammad Ali Boulevard and Ninth and Second streets will be closed. Members of Louisville Showing Up for Racial Justice and The Bail Project Louisville are behind Friday's caravan. Their weekly demonstrations have called on officials like Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer to release inmates from the state's prisons and jails, where the COVID-19 virus has found fertile ground to spread. Here's what we know: 7 shot in downtown Louisville at Breonna Taylor protest 911 call from Breonna Taylor shooting: 'Somebody...shot my girlfriend' This Friday's protest will include the usual loop around the various downtown buildings but also include a vigil on the steps of Metro Hall and highlight Taylor's death. ""Rage and grief are in the streets around the country with the news spreading everywhere about the LMPD killing of Breonna Taylor, the killing of Ahmuad Arbery by white supremacists in a Georgia suburb, and this week’s murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police,"" the coalition said in a news release. ""Freedom Fridays Caravan vs. COVID calls for justice and lifts up the connections between police brutality, mass incarceration, and the tragically insufficient response to ongoing COVID outbreaks in correctional facilities and ICE detention centers. These issues are all products of a racist, inhumane legal system that devalues the lives of Black people, other people of color and the poor."" Latest: Fischer halts no-knock warrants, tells Breonna Taylor protesters 'I hear you' Opinion: White power is America's endless pandemic. Without a cure, more will die Taylor, a 26-year-old ER tech, was shot and killed March 13 by Louisville police officers who executed an early morning ""no-knock"" search warrant at her apartment as part of a drug investigation. No drugs were found in the apartment, and Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, was arrested after he shot and wounded one of the officers who stormed into the residence. Prosecutors later dismissed the charges against Walker, who said he fired in self-defense and fear over whether intruders, not police, were entering the apartment. Attorneys for Walker and for Taylor's family have since disputed LMPD's account that the officers announced themselves before using a battering ram to force their way inside the apartment on Springfield Drive. “The killing of Breonna Taylor, the filing of criminal charges against her partner Kenneth Walker, and the attacks by the Fraternal Order of Police on Judge Olu Stevens for calling out police misconduct, all reflect a criminal justice system that targets communities of color and the poor,” Louisville SURJ member Stephen Bartlett said in the release. “We cannot sit by and allow this state of affairs to continue.” Before Thursday's protest in downtown Louisville, which turned violent and saw seven people shot, Taylor's family and other groups had held demonstrations to demand that Mayor Fischer fire the three officers involved in the fatal raid. Police say they did not fire those gun shots. Her friends and family also held a Memorial Day wreath laying outside her apartment, where they remembered Taylor as a passioniate ER tech at area hospitals who had aspirations of becoming a nurse.

Louisville Metro Police Department spokesperson Alicia Smiley said police made some arrests, but she couldn’t say how many as “the situation is ongoing.” LMPD spokesperson Jessie Halladay said in an email that no officers fired their weapons. Shots could be heard on live streams of the protest before 11:30 p.m., and a WFPL reporter saw two men injured by gunfire at the northeast corner of Jefferson and Sixth streets. Police officers found the men in the crowd and rendered aid, according to reporter Ryan Van Velzer. Here's audio of @RyanVanVelzer describing what he saw.

Some people also slashed the tires and broke the windows out of a prisoner transport vehicle stationed near Metro Hall, shortly before the gunshots. A woman on a bullhorn had tried to encourage protesters not to approach the police, who had formed a line in riot gear to hold the crowd back. Shortly before midnight, LMPD officers began ordering the crowd to disperse and threatening arrest. Tear gas and rubber bullets followed. Around 12:30 a.m., after small fires were set to a picnic table and some recycling bins near Metro Hall, LMPD shared a video from Taylor’s sister. Demonstrators lit fireworks and threw some at police. Heavy rain after 1 a.m. appeared to help clear out the scene. Mayor Greg Fischer shared a statement from Breonna Taylor’s family, asking that protesters “do not succumb to the levels that we see out of the police.” Taylor, 26, was killed in the middle of the night when Louisville Metro Police entered her apartment with a so-called “no-knock” warrant, breaking the door down, on March 13.

The protest moved through downtown for several hours and was largely peaceful, until gunfire rang out and seven people were wounded late in the evening. The demonstration attracted hundreds of people and was in response to the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor during a drug raid conducted by LMPD officers in March. On Friday morning, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said five of the seven wounded were treated at the scene, and two were taken into surgery. All are currently in stable condition, he said. Two police officers were taken to the hospital with chest pains, according to Louisville Metro Police Assistant Chief LaVita Chavous. Three people have been arrested in connection the demonstration, but police say they have no leads in connection with the shootings. Chavous said the department did not deploy tear gas until after protestors began to vandalize private and public property, and gunshots were fired. According to Mayor Fischer, no officers fired their weapons. “We value the right to free speech and understand this community has a lot to say right now,” Chavous said. “We will not tolerate violence that leads to people being hurt. We will not tolerate the destruction of our beautiful city.” With more protests planned for this weekend, Chavous said time off has been cancelled for all officers. She said LMPD is working on a response plan that could involve calling in additional officers from neighboring police departments. Fischer called for an end to the violence. “The fight for justice cannot be won with guns and vandalism,” he said. “It can only be won with persistence and commitment to the shared goal of creating a city of peace, safety, equality and justice for everyone.” He read a statement from Breonna Taylor’s family that expressed the same sentiment. “The last thing that she would want to see right now is any more violence,” Fischer read. “Changes are being made. It’s not enough. It will not stop until there’s truth, justice and accountability.” Taylor, a 26-year-old ER technician, was killed by LMPD officers in her home on March 13. Officers were serving a “no-knock” warrant just after midnight. A lawsuit filed by the family alleges that the police did not identify themselves. Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, has said through his attorney he fired a warning shot at police in self-defense. He claims he did not know who was entering the apartment. His shot hit one of the officers. Police fired back, hitting Taylor at least eight times. Since Taylor’s death made national news, the police chief has announced his retirement and the department has suspended the use of no-knock warrants while the policy is under review. The city also created a committee to consider creation of a Civilian Review Board for the police department, which has its first meeting on Friday. Thursday night’s protests coincided with similar protests in Minneapolis over the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died while in police custody. Protestors took over and burned a Minneapolis Police Department precinct station and dozens of businesses were looted in Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul. U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-KY, issued a statement Friday afternoon, saying the killings of Taylor, Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have “shaken our nation.” According to the statement, “these tragedies do not appear as isolated incidents, but as the latest disturbing chapters in our long, unfinished American struggle to ensure that equal justice under law is not conditional on the color of one’s skin.” McConnell said he is glad Metro Police are investigating Taylor’s death, that the FBI is involved and that Kentucky’s attorney general will evaluate actions that may be necessary. McConnell also condemned Thursday night’s violence in Louisville and elsewhere. “Stealing, burning down buildings, attacking law enforcement officers, or laying siege to police precincts is not speech or protest. It is violent crime that victimizes innocent people,” the statement said. Earlier Friday, Gov. Andy Beshear responded to the protest in a tweet. “My heart aches for Louisville & our country. Breonna Taylor’s family & the public deserve the truth. We should honor Breonna’s legacy as an EMT & the pursuit of the truth should not be marred by violence.”",0.0

None were charged in connection to the shootings that night. LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Three people were arresting during the protests over Breonna Taylor's case in downtown Louisville, citations show. According to arrest citations, Stephanie Garvin and David Wheatley were arrested and charged with first degree riot and criminal mischief. The Louisville Metro Detention Center said Wheatley, 27, was seen breaking the window of a LMDC van. Cameras also caught him breaking a window on the side of the Metro Corrections building. Garvin, 28, was also seen busting out the window of the van and throwing things at the Metro Corrections building. Adair Henderson was arrested for disorderly conduct and failure to disperse. None of the people arrested were connected to the shooting during the protest. LMPD said two of the seven people shot required surgery, and one of the victims was in critical condition as of 10 a.m. Friday. Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous said the shots came from the crowd, and the department currently has no leads on the shooter. The homicide unit is investigating. The protest started peacefully at around 7 p.m., but became more aggressive when people destroyed nearby cars and windows. Chavous said police began to move in once they saw ""significant property damage."" Chavous also said officers deployed tear gas, pepper balls and smoke grenades after shots were fired. Taylor's sister released a statement that night, asking people to stop before people got hurt. ""Thank you so much for saying Breona's name tonight,"" she said. ""We are not going to stop until we get justice, but we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe, and be ready to keep fighting. We appreciate it more than you know.""

As protests continue in Louisville, and around the country, we go through everything in the Breonna Taylor case that led to these moments. Taylor would have been 27 on June 5. LMPD said they were investigating the shooting. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, was charged with attempted murder after he shot Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly during the event. Walker gave a statement saying he shot from inside the apartment. Police said they were met with gunshots when they entered the home. They returned fire, killing Taylor. Louisville Metro Police entered Breonna Taylor's apartment at 3003 Springfield Drive on a no-knock search warrant at around 12:40 a.m. as part of a drug trafficking investigation . They said Walker only shot at officers in self-defense, not knowing who was there, and said he was a registered gun owner. ""This is not a woman who would sacrifice her life and her family morals and values to sell drugs on the street,” Bonica Austin, Taylor’s aunt, said. Taylor's family spoke out after the death, saying officers were looking for someone who did not live at her home. Kenneth Walker was released from jail and placed on home incarceration following his arrest in the officer-involving shooting. Mayor Greg Fischer said he had spoken with Chief Steve Conrad. ""Despite the tragic circumstances surrounding her death, the Department has not provided any answers regarding the facts and circumstances of how this tragedy occurred, nor have they taken responsibility for her senseless killing,"" Crump said in a statement. High-profile Civil Rights Attorney Benjamin Crump, who has represented the families of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery, took on Taylor's case. Crump said no one from LMPD has been held accountable. ""I could hear Kenny screaming and crying and I could hear all of this noise. I'm like, 'what's going on Kenny?' He said, 'I think Breonna is — somebody was trying to break in here and I think they shot Breonna,'"" she said. As the case gained more national attention, Taylor's mother shared information about the shooting . Chapter five : May 13 - No-knock search warrant, affidavits released The no-knock search warrant and affidavits in connection to Taylor's death were released. The warrant revealed Taylor was not the main subject of the warrant. According to the warrant, 30-year-old Jamarcus Glover and 27-year-old Adrian Walker were listed as main suspects. Taylor was listed on the warrant, as was her address. An affidavit by Detective Joshua C. Jaynes says Glover was using Taylor’s address as his own since Feb. 20. Jaynes stated he had observed Glover and Walker since early January running a “trap house"" at 2424 Elliott Ave. Records show Taylor's white 2016 Chevy Impala was spotted at the house occasionally. Glover and Walker would make frequent trips to Taylor’s apartment in a red 2017 Dodge Charger from the house on Elliott Ave, according to the warrant. Jaynes verified through a US Postal Inspector Glover had been receiving packages suspected of drugs to Taylor’s apartment. He was charged the same morning Taylor was killed. Walker was not listed in any documents. While LMPD said detectives knocked several times and announced their presence, Crump said they had witnesses that would prove police wrong. Commonwealth's Attorney recuses himself from case Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer revealed Commonwealth's Attorney Tom Wine would recuse himself in Taylor's case because he was prosecuting Kenneth Walker. LMPD confirmed the three detectives involved have remained on administrative reassignment since the shooting, and Conrad said the investigation was almost completel Photos of aftermath released Attorneys representing Taylor and Walker released images of the bullet holes in Taylor's living room, kitchen area and bathroom.",0.0

Most protesters had their phones up, scanning back and forth to show the size of the growing crowd in downtown Louisville. While it ""felt"" the same at first, the fact that a large Megabus parked on the north side of the intersection of 6th and Jefferson streets was blocking traffic wasimmediately different. The protest was peaceful at that location, with organizers strongly urging protesters to lock arms and stay in line. I heard a woman with a bullhorn trying to keep order. A short time after it began, around 8:30 p.m., a large group broke away and headed down Jefferson Street and then to the Clark Memorial Bridge at Second Street. I continued to take photos asprotesters and police met face to face at the base of the bridge. Organizers urged protesters not to provoke the police, to remain calm.

Louisville Courier Journal People are angry. And for good reason. They want justice after an unarmed African American woman was gunned down in her home in March by Louisville police. They want to be heard. They deserve to be heard. And they have every right to protest, as guaranteed by the First Amendment. But to those who turned a peaceful gathering Thursday night into a violent confrontation that left seven people shot and scores running for their lives: You have no right to attack others, to fire a gun into a crowd, to damage public property or hurt others who gathered with one purpose in mind — to cry out for justice.

(Photo: Michael Clevenger / Courier Journal) But you do have the right to be angry. Put simply, Breonna Taylor shouldn’t be dead. She shouldn’t have been jolted awake by police ramming her apartment door in southwest Louisville. She shouldn’t have been shot eight times during a “no-knock” drug raid that turned up no drugs. And it’s not just what happened in Louisville on March 13 to 26-year-old Breonna that stirs that anger. It’s what happened in Minneapolis on May 25 to George Floyd, who died at the hand of a police officer who took a knee on his neck and wouldn’t let up even when Floyd told him he couldn’t breathe. Three other officers watched the 46-year-old black man lose consciousness and did nothing. It’s what happened in Georgia to Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old African American who was gunned down in February while jogging in a residential neighborhood. It took two months for the people who hunted him down — a retired police detective and his son — to be arrested.

And that is reprehensible. So, a growing chorus of voices are crying out for justice — in Louisville and across the nation. Thursday night, Breonna Taylor’s family urged protesters to be peaceful.

On Friday afternoon, since-fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of Floyd. Community leaders and public officials in Ohio and the Greater Cincinnati have weighed in on the incident and its aftermath. Yvette Simpson, Democracy for America CEO and former city councilwoman, wrote in a statement on Friday that the president's reaction to the uprising in Minneapolis is, “by every measure, racist hypocrisy that encourages and invites a violent reaction.” Rev. Damon Lynch III: “It was heartbreaking. They treated him as if he was subhuman.” Newtown Police Chief Tom Synan, in a Facebook and Twitter post: ""To see the callousness, the inhumanity and the indifference that the officer had, there's no other way to put it, but just horrific.” To use force above the shoulders, “it goes against everything that officers are taught.” Dan Hils, Cincinnati police union president, also posted on Facebook: “I can give no possible explanation of why the officer found it necessary to kneel on Mr. Floyd’s neck.” Butler County Sheriff Richard Jones: ""Terrible. Period. It never should have happened."" Cecil Thomas, state senator and former Cincinnati police officer: “There’s no way in the Minnesota police procedure manual that speaks to putting a knee on someone’s neck."" (President Trump's tweet) “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” he explained, dates back to Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in 1967, who Thomas said was a “racist member of the police department” during that time. “You don’t use lethal force to protect property,” he said. Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters: “No one is debating what occurred in this case. It was horrible to watch and totally unjustified. I urge local authorities in Minneapolis and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to act in a rapid but thorough fashion to seek justice in this matter.""

We are a ticking time bomb here in Cincinnati. If we believe that all is well. It is not. So it is a horrible day in the United States of America. We watched a man put his knee on a black man's neck simply because he was a black man.” Defense attorney Clyde Bennett: ""I think it is a clear, unequivocal demonstration that black life is not valued, black men are feared and police reform is needed. A riot is an expression of individuals who are unheard and powerless. That’s the way to become powerful, that’s the way to get people to look at you, to listen to you.” Derrick Johnson, president and CEO and the national NAACP, in a statement: “Sadly, police brutality against the Black community has been an ever-present circumstance since its origin to preserve the system of slavery. Black families and communities across this country are unified at this moment by unfortunate circumstances. But we must be strategic and measured as we battle this latest grave injustice.""

Seven people were shot, one of them critically injured, as the protest continued well into early Friday morning. City leaders are responding to the violence that occurred during the protest that started peacefully and then turned violent. Friday afternoon, Louisville Metro Council released this statement: ""The Metro Council is shocked and saddened by the killing of Breonna Taylor. We share the community’s despair and frustration. We are listening and taking action. Last night we unanimously demanded the administration release the 911 tapes. We have proposed legislation limiting no-knock warrants. We are creating civilian oversight to add a layer of integrity to future investigations. We welcome the forthcoming change of leadership at LMPD. We support peaceful protests and First Amendment rights. Last night's peaceful protests carrying the positive messages of change, transparency, accountability, oversight and equality were sadly overshadowed by the nonsensical destruction and shootings of seven more Louisvillians. The message was kidnapped by the actions of some who chose to voice those concerns through violence. We do not condone violence of any kind. One person’s right to speak, to assemble, to carry a gun, ends where another human being’s life and safety are at risk. Destruction does not lead to progress. Our prayers are with the people who were injured. We must continue to press for justice and fairness through leadership and compassion. As we move toward justice for Breonna, let us work to be part of the solution and needed change. Breonna lived to save lives, so surely, she would not want further violence to be associated with our call for justice. The best way to effect change is working together as neighbors from all areas of our city, community leaders, and elected officials, to ensure everyone is treated equally by the police and everyone can lead healthy, decent, hopeful lives.""",0.0

But standing in front of Louisville City Hall just hours after the protest erupted, without that hand-less statue as confirmation, I might have wondered if it was all a dream. Hundreds marched in downtown Louisville on Thursday night protesting the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, who was killed by police while she was sleeping when they used a no-knock warrant to enter her home in mid-March. What started as a peaceful demonstration eventually turned violent as seven people were shot before the crowd disbanded around 1 a.m. Like a lot of Louisville, I slept through the gunshots, the chanting and the tear gas, and I started my day reading headlines such as ""Two Minutes of Terror"" and ""'No justice, no peace':7 people shot amid protests for Breonna Taylor,"" reported by my tirelessly committed Courier Journal co-workers, many of whom worked until 3 or 4 a.m. I wasn't sure what I would see when I parked my car about 10:45 a.m. outside of Louis D.

(Photo: Alton Strupp/Courier Journal) I never expected to see the Louisville I know and love. I didn't see the graffiti that Courier Journal photographer Alton Strupp had captured crews scrubbing off walls, windows and monuments around 8:30 a.m. Messages such as ""we matter"" and ""Justice for Breonna"" had already been wiped clean. As I looped the blocks near city hall and up toward Main Street, the only shattered window I spotted read ""Police Department Exit."" It had already been removed and loaded onto a truck bed. I'd hoped to talk with someone doing the scrubbing or the sweeping, but instead, I found people walking their dogs and carrying their takeout back to their offices. Make no mistake, our city is hurting. This column is not meant to disparage the message that the protesters took to the streets last night. You can't wipe away that deep pain like you can take messages off a wall. But in the five hours or so since the sun had come up, our city did its best to put Louisville's physical pieces back together. As I stood near that hand-less statue and among a few trampled flower beds, I marveled at how quickly the teams had worked. I wanted to know how it had gotten done. The Louisville Downtown Partnership put me in touch with James Wells. He's the regional director and on-site manager for Block by Block, a Louisville-based company that works with improvement districts throughout the country to address common downtown issues. Related: Are more protests planned in Louisville over Breonna Taylor's shooting? Wells rallied a team of eight Friday morning and started driving the routes by about 7 a.m. They dispatched two litter vacuums — golf cart-like machines that suck up trash through a hose wider than a dinner plate. They took about seven graffiti tags off buildings. Sometimes that meant painting over them with matching paint, and other times it involved treating the words with chemicals and power washing them away. Wells told me he'd never quite seen anything like this in the Louisville area. The closest he could recall was in September 2008, when the remnants of Hurricane Ike ravaged our city. His team has dealt with trash, debris, broken glass and tags before, but the thing that made Thursday night unique was that it hit our area all in one swing. Before we got off the phone, he made sure to give the real credit to the Louisville Metro workers who cleaned through the night. For the record, I did reach out to them, too. No surprise, they had bigger things to take care of Friday afternoon than giving me a play-by-play of how to remove spray paint. By the time Wells got there, they'd already taken on the brunt of the mess. Technique wise, this didn't really feel any different than cleaning up from other big downtown ""events,"" like the Kentucky Derby Festival's Thunder Over Louisville. What was different, though, was how they spent the rest of the afternoon.

From beneath the lights of helicopters circling in the sky, this was their time to remind the protesters who actually runs Amerika, collectively fantasizing at the potential of the valiant lies of collective bravery and survival they could tell their future grandchildren. The roughly 500 protesters — though the mass appeared to be closer to 1,000 — who had gathered in the radius of Sixth and Jefferson streets were seeking justice for Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and the countless other Black folks murdered by law enforcement. They gathered, peacefully at first, in the streets and just about anywhere else they could position themselves while offering prayers and chants of No Justice! No Peace! Many held bottles of water and gallons of milk in expectation of tear gas and pepper spray that would inevitably take place. The smell of spray paint hung in the night air, a signal of the silent dissent painted on any surface that the protesters could hit. One moment that should not be lost from the evening before Hell was unleashed from canisters was when the hand of King Louis XVI in front of Louisville Metro Hall was loosened from the statue as if he heard there was to be cake on the menu that evening. Standing next to King Louis on the pedestal was a second king who was dressed in UofL basketball shorts and a mask and who was giving an impassioned speech while holding on to Louis’ hand for support. As he spoke, “No justice, no peace! Justice for Breonna!” came the crowd’s echo to his words, with great oratorical flex. Then, suddenly, and without warning, the hand gave way. One king’s body and the other king’s hand to fell to the ground with two solid thumps, one meaty, one marble. The gathered mass gasped appropriately, and then there was silence, their fear of injury palpable as the phalanx of riot police readied themselves for the chance to press into the crowd and then shift the blame. But when the king in his shorts and mask stood, he hoisted Louis hand high above his head, and the gathered protesters laughed and cheered while passing it around like a cosmic beach ball at a festival. One protester who preferred to remain unnamed relayed the moment he saw the hand disembodied from the deposed king. “I rolled,” he said with a sparkle in his eye. “I just couldn’t help but lose my shit.” He also noted, holding his heavy-duty protective mask away from his face, “The cops put their eyes on me as soon as they saw me.” He smiled and continued: “The trick is to let them know that you’re not afraid of them. If you’re not afraid, they don’t have any power. That’s what was happening out there tonight.” Advertisement His theory was soon tested. The pigs in riot gear shuffled from one hoof to the other and snorted in anticipation, waiting for an excuse that could be passed off as a justification for violence when the first water bottle took flight toward them from the crowd. “Don’t throw bottles,” the protesters roared in response, knowing such action was just enough of a tipping point in a land where violence is always coupled with protest. Then, a few brave yet action-oriented members of the gathered began to rock the police van in defiance. Yet this attempt to flip the van and the thrown water bottles were not seen as the excuse the cops were looking for. This was the point when gunfire erupted, which resulted in the seven injured. Police and Mayor Greg Fischer deny that the police fired their weapons but that the shots were from within the crowd. Said Fischer during a briefing Friday morning: “These shots came from within the crowd, not from police officers. No officers fired their weapons. If you hear anything to the contrary, that is not factual.” Regardless, this was the moment that the wave of violence broke and rolled over the crowd, tear gas, smoke grenades and pepper pellets. A beer bottle or two made like doves in search of dry land. Chants of empowerment and justice turned to screams and running, running, running away into the night, blue lights left spinning in the aftermath, casting a shadow on all that it could touch. Passing calls of “Stay safe!” echoed between directions to Run, Run! while bathed in the cloud of gas that swirled, punctuated with pops of gunfire. I had an exchange of “stay safe” with a protester named Maria, while standing on the edge of Armageddon at Sixth Street. She was on the phone with her mother and stated “I’ve been here for two hours,” between pauses of her mother in her ear. Her eyes darted back and forth, desperately searching, assuring her mother that she would leave as soon as she found her friend. “Stay safe,” I told her, eyes and lungs burning as a stark reminder that justice and peace are nowhere to be seen on the darkened horizon. Then, the skies opened and brought the rain that the humidity signaled was on its way for hours, causing the crowd to disperse. This was not the end of the discussion, only a pause in the aftermath of the rains the Almighty brought as a means of baptizing the saints with burning lungs and washing the sins of the evening from the starless evening sky.

This King Louis was famously beheaded in the French Revolution, erasing with him the vestiges of monarchy from that country. Louisville was named for him, ironically, for his support of American rebels trying to break away from monarchy during our first full revolution. For Louisville, the next few days and weeks will tell whether this most-recent outrage over more deaths of innocent Black people will extend to revolution — physical or political — or whether it will simply fizzle out into complacency with a side of Netflix and chill as it tends to do. Louisville’s protest, which brought some 500 people and some say many more, was one of several across the country. They included one in Minneapolis where George Floyd was killed beneath the knee of a cop because he was suspected of the capital offense of forgery. Breonna Taylor, as we know, was shot to death by police in her home after they reportedly faked an affidavit for a no-knock warrant and broke through her door in early morning hours and after they had already arrested the main focus of their investigation at another address. On Friday, as city workers cleaned the graffiti and assessed damage to public property downtown, Mayor Greg Fischer took to Facebook to ask the city to remain peaceful. Seven people were shot, not fatally, during the protest. Standing beside Metro Police Lt. Col. Lavita Chavous, a Black woman wearing a mask, Fischer asserted that those shootings were not by police. “These shots came from within the crowd, not from police officers. No officers fired their weapons. If you hear anything to the contrary, that is not factual,” he said. But, how are we to believe that when police are accused of lying to get the warrant to enter Breonna Taylor’s home without knocking and claimed they had given her and her boyfriend enough notice before doing so — even though a 911 tape shows they had failed. Fischer pledged Breonna Taylor’s death would force changes to help ensure that no more innocent Black people are shot by Louisville police — the city will suspend the use of no-knock warrants, is making sure all police wear body cameras and is improving civilian oversight of the police, including giving them subpoena power. “We understand this is just incident in a book of unequal power dynamic between law enforcement and African Americans in America,” Fischer said, sweeping his hand to explain, “for 400 years.” And this is playing out in our city. I think our opportunity is to show the country how we can get this right, how we can work together to make change, to make positive change and do so in a peaceful manner.” Really? Why should it have taken 400 years? Advertisement And why should it only now be apparent that no-knock warrants are wrong, that all police should wear body cams and that the city has long needed much, much more civilian review of the police — and with subpoena powers? More words. “These changes and more to come, we are not done, should signal to the community that we will continue to make improvements anywhere we can. Breonna Taylor’s name and her story will now be part of our city’s history,” he said. “In Louisville, we have been committed to this for years, and the events have shown we still have much to do, we have always know that, we are committed to this work — whatever it takes and for how long it takes,” Fischer said. Whatever it takes to provoke change was a street protest that ended with minor damage and seven people shot. Perhaps that is why the mayor should not expect the street protests to stop now, because they seem to be working. It also seems like the community is not satisfied with waiting. As for the police, despite their words of empathy, they plan to meet protesters directly and with force, and they have no apologies about doing so. After Fischer spoke, Chavous took the lectern. “Our goal will be to allow for the peaceful expression of protest. We value the right to free speech and understand this community has a lot to say right now. We hear you,” she said. “We will not tolerate violence that leads to people being hurt. We will not tolerate destruction of our beautiful city. We are prepared to take whatever action we must to try to ensure no one else is injured during this time of unrest.” “Allow for the peaceful expression of protest”? As Martin Luther King. Jr. said: “Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.” For Louisville, the next few days and weeks will tell.",0.0

One marched around downtown Louisville, and the other launched from NuLu.Around 7:45 p.m., hundreds packed the front of City Hall chanting, ""no justice, no peace,"" as they did the day before. Others chanted, ""I can't breathe,"" in reference to the killing of George Floyd. As it got close to 9 p.m., all protesting remained peaceful. But not long after, the atmosphere tensed. Flags were torn down from the Hall of Justice; at least two were burned. WLKY saw people breaking out its windows, as well.Then, more than 100 officers in riot gear arrived on scene. By 9:45 p.m., officers had deployed tear gas. People were seen running from it, pouring milk into their eyes to relieve the pain. Pepper balls, which are similar to paint balls, were also used. Crowds eventually marched away from downtown and into the Highlands neighborhood onto Bardstown Road. Well past midnight, things continued to escalate. There have been reports of looting at multiple businesses at 4th Street Live! and nearby.At some point in the night, protesters destroyed a WLKY news vehicle.Police said in a late-night update that they believe many of the protesters are not from Louisville.Mayor Greg Fischer held a news conference at 1 a.m. as people were still out protesting, asking Louisvillians to stay home. Police have said that they believe many of the protesters are not from Louisville.See our Facebook page for more pictures and videos from the protestsFIRST NIGHT OF PROTESTSThursday protests started out calm, but after several hours, turned violent when several shots rang out and seven people were hurt. All are expected to recover, and police says the shots did not come from officers. The protests also resulted in some destruction around the city, including shattered windows, graffiti on buildings, broken statues and more. City and state officials spent Friday making statements about the case and responding to the protests, most calling for people to remain peaceful as they pursue justice. Officers used tear gas, smoke grenades and pepper balls to try and control crowds. Police also said two officers were taken to the hospital with medical conditions spurred by the event. Three people were arrested, but none for the shooting. To prepare for what's to come, all off days for police were canceled. Kentucky State Police will also be on hand to help. LMPD said it is prepared to take action whatever action it must to keep people safe.The mayor also asked people to be safe, not only regarding the shooting, but also the coronavirus. He asked that people gathering in big groups continue to wear masks and social distance.BACKGROUND ON THE CASETaylor, 26, was shot and killed by Louisville Metro Police officers back in March when they executed a search warrant at her apartment.Earlier Thursday afternoon, a 911 call made by Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, was released by her family's attorneys. Commonwealth Attorney Tom Wine said Walker made the call after officers retreated following the gunfire.Walker was initially charged with attempted murder of a police officer after the raid. Officials said he fired first. Walker has said he believed police to be intruders.That charge was dropped last Friday after the prosecutors said they needed more evidence.The FBI and Kentucky Attorney General are now investigating the officers' actions. The officers involved are Sgt. Jon Mattingly, who was shot in the leg during the incident, and Detectives Myles Cosgrove and Brett Hankison.Since the shooting, they have been on administrative reassignment.Protesters WLKY spoke with Thursday said they want to see those officers fired and charged. On Friday, both Fischer and Attorney General Daniel Cameron said these decisions will take time. Fischer said that's in large part due to lack of video.None of the officers were wearing body cameras that night.PROTESTS NATIONWIDETaylor's family is being represented by lawyers who are also representing the family's of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd.Both of their deaths have sparked nationwide outrage recently, as well. Arbery's death seems to have played a part in bringing Taylor's back into the light.Floyd's death led to major unrest in Minneapolis over the last few days. Protesters even torched a police precinct. Then, on Friday, the officer seen kneeling on his neck was arrested and charged with murder in his death.Prior to that announcement, the attorneys discussed all three cases together, calling for a congressional hearing and the creation of a national task force that would create bipartisan legislation aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability.",0.0

The protest started out peacefully before turning violent, with at least seven people shot and wounded by an unknown assailant or assailants. Protesters in Louisville also took to the streets Friday night, which saw looting and widespread damage throughout downtown after police fired tear gas at several groups.

1620501619,2020-05-29 17:46:15,Trump erroneously references Louisville while explaining 'looting leads to shooting' tweet,http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625544536/0/courierjournal/home~Trump-erroneously-references-Louisville-while-explaining-looting-leads-to-shooting-tweet/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"In a Friday tweet explaining his controversial ""looting leads to shooting"" comments, President Donald Trump erroneously referenced the seven people shot the previous night in downtown Louisville during a protest over Breonna Taylor's death. ""Looting leads to shooting, and that's why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot,"" Trump tweeted Friday afternoon. ""I don't want this to happen, and that's what the expression put out last night means."" ""It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,"" the president added in a follow-up tweet. ""It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media. Honor the memory of George Floyd!"" Looting leads to shooting, and that’s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2020 Louisville police did not report any looting during the Thursday night protests, though several people were arrested in connection with damage to property and vehicles. ""We did not see looting last night,"" Louisville Metro Police spokeswoman Jessie Halladay told The Courier Journal on Friday. ""I don’t know if any reports may have been filed today by businesses reporting any thefts, but in the way looting is generally considered, we did not see that last night."" The death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer in Minneapolis pinned him to the ground under his knee on Memorial Day, has resulted in protests and anger not only in Minneapolis but in other cities around the country. The Minneapolis protests have also featured damage and fires at numerous business and a police building. The chaotic scenes in Minneapolis resulted in Trump tweeting just before 1 a.m. Friday that he could not ""stand back & watch this happen to a great American City."" ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” Trump tweeted, adding that he had spoken to Gov. Tim Walz and told him that ""the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" That phrase at the end of Trump's tweet was first used by Miami Police Chief Walter Hedley in 1967, who threatened a crackdown on ""hoodlums"" he said were taking advantage of the civil rights movement. The tweet prompted also Twitter to slap a warning on the pair of Trump's tweets, cautioning users that it violated its policies by glorifying violence. So the Republican president followed up with Friday tweet that mentioned the seven shot and wounded during Thursday night's protest in downtown Louisville over the March death of Taylor. Louisville police say they are still searching for the shooter or shooters, adding that no officers fired their weapons at the protest. Taylor, a 26-year-old ER tech, was fatally shot in March by Louisville Metro Police officers serving a narcotics-related warrant at her apartment. No drugs were found in Taylor's apartment following the deadly encounter, and protests, lawsuits as well as independent investigations have since resulted in regards to the actions of the involved LMPD officers.

""This is a line of white people forming a barrier between Black protesters and the police. This is love. This is what you do with your privilege,"" the post states.

According to Druck, Chanelle Helm, a lead organizer for Black Lives Matter Louisville, said to white protesters using a bullhorn: ""If you are going to be here, you should defend this space,” and instructed people to form the line facing police at 6th and Jefferson streets. ""She was asking for white folks to use their privilege, and put their bodies between police and the other demonstrators,"" Druck said. ""And people responded.

1620544943,2020-05-29 19:29:04,Louisville mayor: Decision on firing police in Breonna Taylor case won't come swiftly,http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625552378/0/courierjournal/home~Louisville-mayor-Decision-on-firing-police-in-Breonna-Taylor-case-wont-come-swiftly/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Addressing calls for the three police officers involved in the raid that led to the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor to be fired, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said procedures and a lack of video evidence mean that decision won't be made quickly. ""The bottom line is this is not a swift process,"" Fischer said in a Friday afternoon press conference. ""I want to acknowledge and realize that there is a conflict between the swift decisions that some people want versus the legal processes and due process that is in place."" Fischer spoke just hours after a protest Thursday evening in downtown Louisville turned violent as demonstrators called for justice in the death of Taylor, an African American who was shot as police executed a ""no-knock"" search warrant at her apartment in the early morning hours of March 13. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, has said he did not realize those entering the home were police when he fired one shot, striking Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, who survived. Taylor was hit at least eight times as police returned fire.

(Photo: Sam Upshaw Jr./Courier Journal) Fischer's comments followed the rapid firings of four police officers in Minnesota, who were terminated one day after the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, died Monday shortly after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Video from the scene shows Floyd telling the officer he could not breath and begging for help before losing consciousness. The former officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Fischer contrasted evidence in that case with that of Taylor, saying there's ""ample"" video of the incident that led to Floyd's death. There is no known video of Taylor's shooting, as undercover narcotics officers were not required to wear body cameras. Many protesters have called for the firing of the officers involved in Taylor's shooting — identified by the police department as Mattingly and Officers Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove. But Fischer pointed to existing state and local laws as well as the collective bargaining agreement with the police union, which lay out a process for officer firings. He briefly outlined the process, saying LMPD's Public Integrity Unit conducts a criminal investigation for possible violations of state law, after which the Kentucky Attorney General's Office will decide on filing criminal charges. Much of that investigation has been handed over to Attorney General Daniel Cameron's office. After prosecutors make their decision, the police department will launch an internal affairs investigation for possible violations of departmental policy, which can lead to termination. Officer terminations can then be appealed to the police merit board. ""As I've said, I recognize the system is not a best practice for our community,"" Fischer said. ""And that's why, as I mentioned, we have a group, starting today, to look into creating a strong, independent review board with subpoena power."" CLOSE Commonwealth’s Attorney Tom Wine announced his office will move to dismiss all charges against Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend. Louisville Courier Journal Related: Group created in wake of Breonna Taylor shooting to propose new LMPD oversight by July He also noted he has listened to calls from those protesting Taylor's killing, saying this week he suspended no-knock warrants and will now require all sworn officers to wear body cameras when serving warrants.

He doesn't often take political stances. But that changed Thursday when he became a major figure at a protest against Louisville police over the shooting of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed black woman who was killed in a late-night raid of her apartment. For hours, Jones walked the city's downtown streets with hundreds of others, livestreaming a mostly peaceful gathering that followed protests across the country, where people have called for justice in several high-profile deaths of black men and women at the hands of police. ""What am I supposed to do?"" Jones said Friday. ""(Police) put us in a position where it's like we've got no choice; we've got to do something because we can't keep allowing you to do this."" It was a sentiment that many protesters expressed as they made their way toward the crowd Thursday night, where emotions that had been building for months spilled out. Eventually, violence erupted at the corner of Sixth and Jefferson streets, where seven people were shot near the steps of Metro Hall. Live updates: LMPD hoping for peaceful protests but will take action necessary Since Taylor's death in March, outrage has grown on behalf of the 26-year-old, as well as two black men who were recently killed by police or former police in Georgia and Minnesota. In Louisville, friends and strangers have called for answers and changes from local officials, including a ban of no-knock warrants and the firing of three officers who were involved. While Mayor Greg Fischer on Friday suspended no-knock warrants in response to the protest, they have not been prohibited permanently. And the officers remain on paid administrative leave while under internal investigation. ""Every day they're sitting at a desk getting paid, the anger is escalating,"" said Shameka Parrish-Wright, a local activist and member of Black Lives Matter Louisville. ""We're tired of seeing these same narratives over and over and over again. ... We just want to see that somebody is going to be held accountable when something happens to our community."" Cassia Herron, another local activist, said she was not at the protest, but said what happened in downtown Louisville was ""a reflection of people being frustrated about what's happening and not happening in our local community."" “It’s a convergence of this moment that we are in in history — of the many injustices going on in our country,"" she said. ""Now, quarantined and isolated in our homes the last couple of months, folks have been affected by that based on how much money they have and their access to health care and the ability to have money to buy groceries. In the midst of that, we get to continue to watch Americans be brutalized by public safety officers across the country."" Full story: 7 people shot amid downtown Louisville protests for Breonna Taylor Thursday's protest happened organically, starting with a single Facebook post that asked people to meet at 6 p.m. at a fast food restaurant on 10th Street. But as videos of the gathering spread on social media, more began to join. And by 8:30 p.m., hundreds were at the corner of Sixth and Jefferson streets, framed by the judicial center, Metro Hall and City Hall. “We’ve tried the peaceful protest countless times,"" said Jecorey Arthur, a Metro Council candidate. ""This isn’t the first time we’ve seen protests in this city or in this country. … We need to come to the realization, we can’t wait any longer. I don’t want my 2-year-old to turn around and protest 50, 60, 70 years from now. We need to make this the moment where we decide what type of city are we going to be?” Many in the crowd were young — teenagers and 20-somethings who set aside their differences to join in unity against what they see as continued injustice, several at the protest said. ""Breonna was a reality check for these kids,"" Parrish-Wright said. ""A lot of them went to school with her. ... They're directly connected with her. ... This is directly their age group that is impacted. That's why this is so intense right now."" Related: Viral photo shows line of white people between police, black protesters Jones and Parrish-Wright said they also can't forget a moment near the KFC Yum Center, where protesters were met by a line of baton-wielding police. As black protesters created a line of their own, white protesters moved in front of them, linking arms to protect their black peers from any potential harm. A photo of the scene has gone viral. ""The white front line has ... boulders in their skin where they took so many rubber bullets,"" Parrish-Wright said. ""I ain't never seen nothing like that,"" Jones added. A line of almost all white women formed between police officers and black protesters at Thursday night's rally in downtown Louisville calling for justice in the death of Breonna Taylor. (Photo: Tim Druck) Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey, who briefly attended the protest, said she was struck by the diversity of people she saw — white, black, young, old. ""Last night we saw that our similarities are greater than our differences,"" she said. ""... Breonna’s just the intersection of a long line of oppression, and at this point, we’ve reached the impetus of change.” Read more: 'Tough for all of us': Leaders react to Breonna Taylor protest Reach reporter Bailey Loosemore at bloosemore@courier-journal.com, 502-582-4646 or on Twitter @bloosemore.

UPDATES: *** Organizers are asking those who participate to follow a detailed list of guidelines that include: Do not incite violence Do not destroy property Do your best to practice social distancing Do not engage with counter-protesters Do not engage with police Do not run from the police Have your ID and a number for an emergency contact in your pocket Obey traffic laws Use your camera to record all events Administer aid to those in need Protesters seek justice for death of George Floyd in Atlanta - May 29, 2020 1/52 2/52 3/52 4/52 5/52 6/52 7/52 8/52 9/52 10/52 11/52 12/52 13/52 14/52 15/52 16/52 17/52 18/52 19/52 20/52 21/52 22/52 23/52 24/52 25/52 26/52 27/52 28/52 29/52 30/52 31/52 32/52 33/52 34/52 35/52 36/52 37/52 38/52 39/52 40/52 41/52 42/52 43/52 44/52 45/52 46/52 47/52 48/52 49/52 50/52 51/52 52/52 1 / 52 The protest comes on the heels of widespread demonstrations in Minneapolis this week that have captured the nation's attention. Those protests flared after the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis officer, who was recorded digging his knee into Floyd's neck as he was detained on the ground. Onlookers pleaded with the officer to stop, as Floyd said he couldn't breathe. Floyd died after the officer continued to keep his knee on his neck for a number of minutes. A national outcry was also sparked by the killing of Arbery, who was running in a neighborhood in southeast Georgia when he was accosted, and subsequently shot to death, by two white men who claimed they were making a citizen's arrest. Arbery was shown in security footage briefly walking into an unfinished home and glancing around, something the owner later said indicated to him he was looking for a water source on the property, which people sometimes try to drink from. Further security videos showed it was not uncommon for bypassers to walk onto the property. The killing drew further backlash because the men, a father and son, were not arrested or charged for more than two months. The father had worked in the past both for the local police department and prosecutor. Two district attorneys who first had jurisdiction over the case and recused themselves are now being investigated for potential ""prosecutorial misconduct."" Taylor was shot and killed in her apartment by Louisville officers who said they were conducting a drug investigation in March. They've said they were fired upon when they entered. Her boyfriend has said the police stormed in without warning and he fired once, not knowing who was breaking in. A charge against him for shooting an officer in the leg was dropped last week. No drugs were found in the apartment. Taylor was a front-line emergency medical technician.",0.0

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Black Lives Matter Louisville leader Chanelle Helm has been a part of several protests in the past. She said Thursday night's protest in downtown Louisville wasn't surprising. ""This didn't start with Breonna Taylor. This didn't start with George Floyd. It didn't start with anybody's police killing. It started 600 years ago when white supremacy was a tool for destruction,"" she said. ""It's just outrageous that we keep asking these questions and we know what the problem is."" That problem, according to Helm, is a broken system of policing that disproportionately hurts people of color. She said Thursday was simply the boiling point of that outrage and frustration in Louisville with the recent deaths of Breonna Taylor in Louisville and George Floyd in Minneapolis still fresh on the minds of the protestors who gathered downtown. As an organizer, Helm said her goal is to help coordinate the protestors to get their message across clearly while also keeping people safe. While the plan is to have a peaceful protest, she said Thursday night was a cry for change from the community that has not felt like it has been heard. ""Everyone wants to have this notion of this utopian society that we always hear in the aftermath of these things,"" she said. ""People aren't going to come together until folks understand the injustices that are provided by the state onto black and brown people."" Helm said she is working with other community leaders on a plan moving forward. She said Black Lives Matter Louisville is not organizing any of the Friday events. ►Contact reporter Dennis Ting at dting@whas11.com. Follow him on Twitter (@DennisJTing) and Facebook.

(BP) -- On average, eight Christians died for their faith every day in 2019. That equals more than 2,920 people killed for the cause of Christ last year, according to the 2020 annual report from Open Doors' World Watch List. In addition, 9,488 churches or Christian buildings were attacked, and 3,711 Christians were detained without trial, arrested, sentenced and imprisoned.  Open Doors reported that 260 million Christians experienced high levels of persecution in the top 50 countries on the World Watch List in 2019. The top five were North Korea, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya and Pakistan.  In recognition of the persecution faced by Christians around the world, the Southern Baptist Convention last year designated the first Sunday in June as a Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church. This year, that's June 7.  International Mission Board President Paul Chitwood affirmed the necessity of intercessory prayer on behalf of Christians suffering for their faith.  ""Prayer is our greatest resource in the Great Commission, and it is also the greatest act of compassion we could perform for our brothers and sisters around the globe who are enduring persecution,"" Chitwood said. ""Just as the souls of those slain for their faith cry out in heaven, 'O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood ...' (Revelation 6:10, ESV), we should cry out on behalf of those on earth who continue to suffer.  ""We ask God to give them courage and hope. We know that their temporary suffering will be rewarded in eternity and pray that it will result in many being saved from among the nations.""  Not without sacrifice  Throughout their 175-year history, Southern Baptists have maintained an uninterrupted witness among the nations, in spite of famine, war and civil unrest. This commitment has not come without sacrifice.  Since the founding of the Foreign Mission Board (now the IMB) in 1845, approximately 60 missionaries and children have died in violent circumstances while serving with the organization. Causes include accidents such as drowning, automobile and aircraft crashes and ships lost at sea. Others died as a result of war and criminal or terrorist acts. In some cases, the missionaries were targeted specifically because of their faith or missionary service.  Of those 60, more than 20 FMB/IMB missionaries lost their lives ""as a result of human hostility in a cross-cultural setting,"" said Scott Peterson of IMB's global research team.  The first was J. Landrum Holmes, who served in China. Holmes and his wife Sallie were appointed by the Foreign Mission Board in 1858 and arrived in China in 1859. Less than three years later, Taiping rebels murdered Holmes and Episcopal missionary Henry M. Parker. Although family encouraged Sallie Holmes to return to the U.S., the young mother chose to stay in China with her newborn son.  Writing home, Sallie said at the time, ""I think I might probably be instrumental in the conversion of more persons at home than here, but if I went home for that and other missionaries acted upon the same principle I doubt if there would be a missionary left in China.""  Sallie Holmes went on to mentor one of IMB's most famous missionaries, Charlotte Digges ""Lottie"" Moon, for whom IMB's annual missions offering is named. Lottie Moon also died while in active service aboard a ship docked in Kobe Harbor, Japan, December 24, 1912.  Although both Landrum Holmes and Lottie Moon died while in active service, neither is considered a martyr.  ""The IMB does not typically refer to or describe our personnel who have died in active service as martyrs,"" Peterson said. ""In many cases, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine if our personnel (who died due to violence) were targeted because they were missionaries or Christians.""  Terminology notwithstanding, the sacrifice of those who died while serving cross-culturally -- regardless of the means or cause of death -- is no less significant than those who were targeted specifically for their faith, Peterson said.  ""The fact that we do not use the term [martyr] does not minimize the significance of the lives and sacrifice of those who died while serving cross-culturally,"" he said. ""We memorialize all of our personnel who die in active service regardless of the cause of death. Each of those is a sacrifice because of a life lived in obedience to Christ.""",0.0

Mitch McConnell noting ""these tragedies do not appear as isolated incidents."" McConnell, R-Ky., released an afternoon statement saying the killings of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, George Floyd in Minneapolis and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia ""have shaken our nation"" ""For millions and millions of outraged Americans, these tragedies do not appear as isolated incidents, but as the latest disturbing chapters in our long, unfinished American struggle to ensure that equal justice under law is not conditional on the color of one’s skin,"" McConnell stated. McConnell expressed support for the investigations into Taylor's death and said her family members ""deserve truth, accountability, and justice,"" but decried the violence that took place in Louisville and Minneapolis Thursday night. ""Stealing, burning down buildings, attacking law enforcement officers, or laying siege to police precincts is not speech or protest,"" McConnell stated. ""It is violent crime that victimizes innocent people. Kentuckians cannot and will not accept violence and chaos on our streets."" Also: Mayor Fischer suspends no-knock warrants, telling Breonna Taylor protesters 'I hear you' Hundreds of protesters marched through the streets of Louisville Thursday night demanding justice for Taylor, who in March was shot and killed in by Louisville police officers who busted into her apartment on a ""no knock"" warrant. Late into the protest, a group tried to tip an LMPD armored vehicle, breaking its windows and slashing its tires, after which multiple gunshots rang out. Seven people ended up shot. LMPD put out a statement early Friday morning saying none of its officers fired their guns. LMPD announced late Friday morning that it had no leads on who fired the gunshots. Louisville Metro Council members in a joint statement said that the peaceful protest that began the evening was ""sadly overshadowed by the nonsensical destruction and shootings of seven more Louisvillians."" ""The message was kidnapped by the actions of some who chose to voice those concerns through violence,"" the statement said. ""As we move toward justice for Breonna, let us work to be part of the solution and needed change."" ""Breonna lived to save lives, so surely, she would not want further violence to be associated with our call for justice,"" it added. U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth of Louisville also reacted on Friday to the chaos and violence that capped off the protest in downtown Louisville. ""Last night was tough for us all,"" Yarmuth tweeted. ""Heartbroken to see gunfire erupt during otherwise peaceful protests here in Louisville."" Last night was tough for us all. Heartbroken to see gunfire erupt during otherwise peaceful protests here in Louisville. Angered by the President outright fanning the flames and inciting violence against protestors in MN (or anywhere.) I pray that justice and order will prevail. — Rep. John Yarmuth (@RepJohnYarmuth) May 29, 2020 Also Friday morning, Gov. Andy Beshear tweeted out a statement from Tamika Palmer, the mother of Taylor, that urged avoiding violence as they demand accountability for her death. ""Breonna Taylor’s family & the public deserve the truth,"" Beshear tweeted. ""We should honor Breonna’s legacy as an EMT & the pursuit of the truth should not be marred by violence."" LISTEN: Courier Journal's Cameron Teague Robinson shares what he saw at Breonna Taylor protest Beshear, a Democrat, also appeared on CNN Friday morning to repeat Palmer's words, saying what had been a peaceful protest unfortunately turned violent late into the night. ""I believe that some other folks, very late, more than three hours in, came in and ultimately instigated and caused some actions that turned it into something that it should not have been,"" Beshear said. Beshear also addressed the protest in his daily press conference Friday, adding that Louisville is ""a city where we can see the impacts and the vestiges of slavery, of segregation, of Jim Crow. And it’s almost that it occurs on a specific street."" Later in the press conference, he added: ""I can't pretend to understand the level of frustration, fatigue, that people must feel with hundreds of years of inequality. ... To see videos of someone putting their knee on someone else's throat while they cry out for help and nobody does anything about it. I can't pretend to know how that feels. I can commit to listen. Being the governor ... I can commit to doing everything I can in our system to help."" Protests and violence also continued in Minneapolis over the death of Floyd, a black man killed in police custody after a white officer pinned his neck to the ground with his knee. CLOSE Multiple gunshots ring out as protesters attempt to overturn a police vehicle in front of Louisville Metro Hall on West Jefferson in downtown Louisville. Louisville Courier Journal Yarmuth, a Democrat, also reacted to a tweet from President Donald Trump early Friday morning, who called those behind looting and violence in Minneapolis ""THUGS"" and added ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" ""Angered by the President outright fanning the flames and inciting violence against protestors in MN (or anywhere.) I pray that justice and order will prevail,"" Yarmuth tweeted. Twitter did not delete Trump's tweet but added a disclaimer to it stating: ""This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible."" On CNN, Beshear also called on Trump to retract his tweet, saying elected officials have a responsibility ""not just to maintain the peace, which is what we ought to be doing, but to also listen, to show empathy, and to try to find a way to move in the right direction, not the wrong one."" Louisville mayor: 'Answering violence with violence' not the answer to Breonna Taylor death Trump stood by the tweet and addressed the seven people shot in Louisville in a Friday afternoon tweet. Looting leads to shooting, and that’s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2020 ""Looting leads to shooting, and that’s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot,"" Trump tweeted. ""I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means. It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement."" There were no reports of looting in Louisville. The police department says it does not know who fired the shots but says no officers fired their weapons during the protest. Yarmuth went on to tweet that the deaths of Taylor and Floyd ""and all other manifestations of racism are as poisonous as COVID-19."" ""In America, racism is as old as time, but it is past time for all elected officials to raise their voices in a deafening chorus against racism in our justice system."" Asked about Trump's tweets at a Friday morning press conference in Kentucky, McConnell declined to comment. “I generally don't comment on the President's tweets,"" McConnell said. ""I can speak for myself."" McConnell also said the Minneapolis police officers involved in the death of Floyd ""look pretty darn guilty."" In Kentucky, the state FOP said the Breonna Taylor protests on Thursday showcased Louisville Metro Police officers' ""professionalism and dedication to their city and fellow citizens,"" praising them while criticizing decisions made by city leadership. ""Officers were surrounded during several encounters and eventually debris and other objects, including fireworks, were used as weapons targeting police,"" wrote FOP President Berl Perdue. ""This is unacceptable. Mayor Greg Fischer and Chief Steve Conrad have once again shown their failure to maintain order and safety in our city. Officers were told at numerous turns to stand down."" Kentucky House and Senate Democratic Leaders Joni Jenkins and Morgan McGarvey said in a statement that ""(w)e need listening, understanding, trust, and inclusion from every institution in our lives."" ""The names of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and countless others must never be forgotten, and it is equally vital that we build on their legacy with love, accountability and justice,"" Jenkins and McGarvey said. ""We can do that without violence and without hate. This is the challenge of our lifetime."" This story may updated. Reporters Billy Kobin and Darcy Costello contributed to this report.

Storyful MINNEAPOLIS — Protests in the aftermath of George Floyd's death continued in Minneapolis and nationwide despite the arrest of one of the four former police officers involved in a Memorial Day incident that has sparked coast-to-coast outrage. More than 1,000 protesters shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis in a peaceful demonstration before heading for Interstate 35 on Friday night. Earlier in the day, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said fired MPD officer Derek Chauvin was in custody and facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. The crowd marched to the bridge, where they met with a group led by Korey Dean Sr., P.J. Hill and former Iowa State basketball player Royce White. Dean asked the protesters to adhere to the day's 8 p.m. curfew, which was put in place in response to days of ""civil disturbance."" Not everyone listened. Several shouted “(expletive) that curfew."" George Floyd protests: How did we get here? People listened to a range of speeches from leaders. Dean encouraged young black men to become police officers so they can change policies and practices. “We need to transform the police department from the inside,” he said. A passerby scoffed, “What is he talking about? We don’t need more cops, bro.” White said he was heartened by the turnout in his hometown. “Where is Mayor Jacob Frey?” White said. “Why isn’t he out here getting maced with us.” The former NBA player said his role as a professional athlete can help being more awareness to pressing issues. He added that rioters and looters aren’t using tactics he’d support, but he understands the frustration. “We’ve been trying the peaceful route,” he said before the march. “And that hasn’t been working.” Once on the bridge, a renewed cry of “no justice, no peace, prosecute the police” rang out. Just before 6 p.m, the demonstrators stopped northbound traffic on the interstate. Motorists in the southbound lane, including a Minneapolis Fire Department truck, seemingly honked in support of the demonstration. 8 minutes, 46 seconds: What's in the criminal complaint in the George Floyd case The early part of Friday's protest in Minneapolis was a far cry from the chaos of Thursday night, culminating in protesters breaching the MPD's 3rd precinct building and setting it ablaze. That prompted a response from President Donald Trump on Twitter, where he called protesters ""thugs."" Speaking to a large group of protesters on Friday, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, called for calm — but said he understood why people were lashing out. “When you’ve held captive, you end up turning against each other,"" he said, urging his fellow residents to exercise their voting rights to change the system he said oppresses people. “What is it going to take to get people to listen? They say don’t incite violence, but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital? he asked. ""We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson added Chauvin's arrest was just a first step. No charges have been announced for the other three officers involved in the incident. ""I don't want to burn down (expletive) either,"" he said ""I don't. But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" Protests also persisted across the nation. The White House was put on lockdown after protests reached the nation's capital, a spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY. Protests in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, to new a few places, also continued.

While the largest protests have enveloped Minneapolis, prompting the deployment of 500 National Guardsmen, people have already taken to the streets from New York to Chicago to the California coast. Seven people were shot during a protest in Louisville on Thursday night, dozens were arrested in New York City, officers fired rubber bullets into a crowd of protesters in Phoenix and a driver appeared to intentionally run over a protester in Denver. But that could be just the beginning of a long and rage-filled weekend as Americans process the latest case of police brutality against an unarmed citizen. 'I'm with the protesters' What's different this time, however, is that political and law enforcement leaders are largely siding with protesters. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock and Police Chief Paul Pazen spoke one after the other during a joint press conference on Friday, decrying the death of Floyd and encouraging their citizens to continue making their voices heard despite violent protests the night before that led to three officers being injured and the arrest of 13 protesters. ""I, along with members of this department, send our condolences to the family and loved ones of George Floyd,"" Pazan said. ""Our heart hurts just as much as this community and the community in Minnesota."" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo listed off case after case of black men killed by police and lamented how little appears to have changed. ""I’ve lived this from Rodney King forward. I was there for Amadou Diallo. I was there for Abner Louima. And then you have Eric Garner,"" Cuomo said during his regular coronavirus briefing on Friday. ""And what happened? What was the resolution? Where was the progress? ""I’m with the protesters."" But each leader made clear that they will not allow peaceful protests to devolve into the burning, violent situations seen in Minneapolis. While few gave details about their plans, they all stressed that they were taking precautions, mobilizing their police forces and ready to stop those who use the protests as cover to cause mayhem. Protests in New York City had already resumed by Friday afternoon. A Black Lives Matter protest was underway in Houston. And a third day of protests in Detroit had shifted from a Floyd-focused message to a broader attack against injustice. ""It is just a consistent violence against black and brown people by many police agencies — it's not just one, it's not an isolated incident, you can see this happens across the country,"" said Trische Duckworth, an organizer of the Detroit protests. Those demonstrations are expected to continue throughout the weekend in cities large and small across the country. There's a Saturday protest planned by Mothers Against Violence in Des Moines, Iowa. There's a Saturday protest planned in Austin, Texas, linking Floyd's death with the April shooting of an unarmed black man in that city. And there's a Saturday protest planned in Miami, a city with its own history of violent protests following the shooting death of a black man by white officers in 1979. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez cited that dark history to explain why he and the leadership of the Miami Police Department decried the tactics used in Floyd's death. Police officials met with black community leaders on Friday, and Suarez said he was scheduled to meet with black pastors on Saturday morning. Suarez said he encourages protesters and has coordinated with police to make sure they do not patrol in tactical gear to avoid escalating tensions during Saturday's protest. And even though Chauvin is now in custody, Suarez said he doesn't expect that to slow down the momentum of the nationwide protests. ""The fact that he was arrested will be a small measure of consolation,"" Suarez said. ""People are at the end of their rope. They're just tired of it all. When there's rioting and demonstrations, it's because things have boiled over."" The most surprising protests may be taking place in Central Florida. Protests have been happening in Windermere, Florida, a tiny, upscale, lakeside town nestled between downtown Orlando and Disney World. Word spread on social media that Chauvin has a home there, prompting dozens of protesters to descend on the address on Thursday. Orange County Sheriff's Office deputies quickly responded and made contact with Chauvin's family, who verified that they owned the home but said they were not there and had no plans to go there. Orange County Sheriff John Mina on Friday said the video of Floyd's death was so upsetting that he suggested it be added to his department's training as an example of what not to do when subduing a suspect. On Friday, Mina said he would not stand in the way of protesters who wanted to express their anger over the death of Floyd. ""We understand that people in Minneapolis, people across the nation, and people here in our own community are hurting and we understand people want to do something, they want to protest,"" he said.

Beshear hung during protest,https://www.grantky.com/content/ky-politicians-react-effigy-gov-beshear-hung-during-protest,en,False,,660990,Grant County News,http://www.grantky.com/,"By Mark Maynard Kentucky Today Kentucky politicians were quick to react in condemnation to an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear that was hung in a tree at the Capitol during a protest on May 24 that included protesters chanting “Come out Andy!” and “Resign Andy!” in front of the governor’s mansion. The Patriot Day Second Amendment Rally, which was supposed to be a celebration of constitutional rights on Memorial Day weekend, attracted about 100 people. They were protesting the coronavirus restrictions and Beshear’s administration. Pictures and videos taken by the Courier-Journal and others show an effigy of Beshear that was hung in a tree along with a sign that read “Sic Semper Tyrannis.” Politicians from both major parties reacted swiftly and spoke out against the effigy on their social media platforms. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron said in a tweet: “This is sickening, and I condemn it. We have to learn to disagree without threats of violence.” Senate Majority Leader Damon Thayer, R-Gerogetown, condemned what happened at the protest. “These actions are reprehensible,” he said on Twitter. “I absolutely condemn violence and threats of violence. If you want to protest, do it peacefully & respectfully.” Kentucky Secretary of State Michael G. Adams, a Republican, also reacted in a tweet. “This is disgusting and I condemn it wholeheartedly. The words of John Wilkes Booth have no place in the Party of Lincoln.” State Senate Minority Leader Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville, called on elected officials to condemn the “violent threats” on Twitter. “This is a new low and it is disgusting and wrong,” he said in a tweet. “I wish I were more surprised but this vitriol comes from the top. I hope Republican leaders join me in condemning violent threats against any elected official.” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Whitney Westerfield, R-Hopkinsville, said in a tweet, “This awfulness has no place in civil society.” House Democratic leadership also released a statement Sunday calling on elected officials to condemn the effigy. “Hanging Governor Beshear in effigy is beyond reprehensible, and yet it is also the logical conclusion of the hateful rhetoric we saw touted on the Capitol grounds earlier this month that was implicitly condoned by elected representatives from the legislature’s majority party,” House Democratic leadership said in the statement. “Doing this in front of our Capitol, just a short walk from where the Governor, First Lady, and their two young children live, is an act that reeks of hate and intimidation and does nothing but undermine our leading work to battle this deadly disease and restore our economy safely.” The Republican Party of Kentucky also issued a statement: “What occurred at today’s rally was unacceptable and has no place in Kentucky’s political discourse. The Republican Party of Kentucky strongly condemns the violent imagery against the Governor in today’s protest.” ",0.0

But she will not be attending any protests Friday night, and cautioned people that violence and anger will not change these deeply ingrained systems. “We cannot continue to kill ourselves in an attempt to cope with the pain of our existence in this space,” she said during a Friday afternoon press conference outside the Urban League offices. “Our fight must be strategic.” Reynolds applauded the efforts the city has undertaken, including Friday’s announcement that no-knock warrants would be temporarily suspended. But she said there is so much more work to be done — and it shouldn’t have to fall on black protesters to do it. “That work belongs to white people,” she said. That is why she said she cannot condone protesters taking to the streets Friday night. She said she won’t be there, and she won’t allow her children to attend either. She worries that the peaceful protests planned by the community will turn violent from outside agitators. But she understands the anger that is coursing through the city’s black community right now. “People want accountability, accountability for officers who can do better, and choose not to in black communities,” she said. “We are beyond tired. Breonna Taylor is not the first but we are committed to making her the last in this community.” As she spoke, it began to rain. “Our city is crying,” she said, her mascara running down her face. “The rain is appropriate. We are saying: Bre is the last one.”",0.0

Andy Beshear announced 283 new cases of the coronavirus Friday evening, a significant single-day rise, and nine new deaths. Beshear cautioned against drawing any conclusions from the increase, saying the four-day average is 158 new cases, and that’s still a drop from where Kentucky was a couple weeks ago. “I don’t want to suggest that it means something at this point either way,” Beshear said. The state has now tested nearly 228,000 people. Cabinet for Health and Family Services Secretary Eric Friedlander praised the collaboration between health care providers and public health departments, and said the state is aggressively testing at long-term care facilities, where 1,885 cases and 244 deaths have been recorded from the coronavirus. Protests In Louisville Beshear opened his briefing Friday by speaking about the death of Breonna Taylor, and Thursday night’s protest, where seven people were shot. No arrests have been made in connection with the shooting. Beshear said he lived in Louisville for 15 years before moving his family to Frankfort, and that it’s a special place — but also a place where we can see the effects of Jim Crow, racism and longstanding inequality. He noted that Thursday’s protest was very peaceful, and more consistent with CDC guidelines than any he’s seen recently. “These were people truly looking out for human life,” he said. “Other folks very late, more than three hours, in came in and ultimately instigated actions that have been hard to see.” Protesters broke the King Louis statue by Metro City Hall and attempted to tip over a police transport van shortly before gunshots rang out. Police later attempted to disperse the crowd with tear gas and pepper balls. Medicaid Contracts Issued The state has awarded its contracts for Medicaid Managed Care Providers to Aetna, Humana, Molina Healthcare, UnitedHealthcare and WellCare. Not on the list: Anthem or Passport. Beshear said Molina has announced plans to put its headquarters in West Louisville and bring with it 1,100 jobs. A representative of Passport said in a press release that the company will protest the award. “I actually do believe that while this is hard, saying goodbye to Passport, that we are going to see investment from multiple of the award winners that will be transformational,” Beshear said.",0.0

Police in riot gear set off tear gas and flashbangs as they faced off with protesters. During the course of the evening, the protest splintered into several groups: those that stayed around Fifth and Jefferson despite efforts to disperse the crowd, some that walked down Broadway with protest signs, those breaking windows and looting Fourth Street properties and another group that was walking through the Highlands down Bardstown Road, tailed by police. During a briefing shortly after 1 a.m., Mayor Greg Fischer said there was no excuse for the property damage that occurred, and that it did not honor the memory of Breonna Taylor, 26, who died March 13 after LMPD officers shot her while executing a “no-knock” warrant. “Many came tonight to express frustration” about Taylor’s death, Fischer said. “I respect that right. Unfortunately, another faction used the occasion of a protest as an excuse to cause destruction. It besmirches any claim to honor Breonna Taylor’s memory.” LMPD spokesperson Jessie Halladay said the police department’s primary concern was safety, and that posed significant challenges for officers to move through pockets of protest and respond to property destruction. “We’ve been trying to stay as hands-off as we can,” Halladay said. Two protesters were arrested Friday evening, she said. There were no serious injuries she knew of, although a cameraman from a local news station was taken to the hospital. Destruction Began Early Tonight, early in the evening, protesters pulled down American and Louisville flags and lit the American flag on fire before spray-painting it black. As the sunset around 9 p.m. Friday, protesters broke out a window at the Hall of Justice and a small fire was lit inside the window. Kentucky State Police troopers in riot gear were stationed throughout downtown Friday evening. An LMPD quick response team moved into the area around the Hall of Justice around 9:30 p.m. and deployed tear gas to push protesters out of the area. At least 200 people took their peaceful protest down Bardstown Road, carrying signs and chanting Taylor’s name for much of the trek that stretched from Broadway south to Eastern Parkway. Dozens of police trailed the protesters in cruisers and some in riot gear blocked the entrance to Mid City Mall. When the group arrived at the intersection of Bardstown and Eastern Parkway — not far from Mayor Greg Fischer’s home — nearly everyone knelt and raised their fist in silence. They then retreated back along the corridor that’s long been a hub of entertainment and eating. At least one instance of property damage occurred when two men threw rocks into a window of an electronics store, breaking the window. For most of the evening, the protest was centered around Jefferson and Sixth streets, near Metro Hall, LMPD headquarters, the jail and the Hall of Justice and the site of a shooting last night. By 10:30 p.m., protesters were using trash cans lit on fire to form barricades in the roads and had begun breaking out windows at downtown businesses, including T-Mobile and a Subway sandwich shop. By midnight, much of Fourth Street Live was affected, with businesses’ windows broken out, looters stealing merchandise and trees and plants toppled. The Craft Gallery and Mercantile on Fourth Street had its window smashed in. Owner David McGuire told WFPL he hasn’t seen the police, and he wants the mayor to answer for this. During a press briefing, Halladay of LMPD said the crowd had appeared to be escalating, not de-escalating. “We are trying to manage this situation in a way that keeps everyone safe,” Halladay said. “It’s not so simple as to say we are going to shut down the protest.” Jeff Young and J.

Kurtz expressed his support of peaceful protests “that give voice to the pain of the community and to the desire for truth and justice to be served.” He also said he lamented the “senseless violence” that developed overnight after peaceful protests had drawn hundreds to downtown Louisville May 28. Louisville protesters joined demonstrators in major cities around the country demanding justice for victims of police violence and racism May 28 and 29. Last night they chanted “No justice, no peace” as they made their way through the streets of the downtown area, stopping periodically to chant and block intersections. In the early hours of May 29, shots were fired by a person or persons in the crowd and seven people were wounded, according to the Louisville Metro Police Department. And three protesters were arrested after windows in Metro Corrections property were broken, according to local news reports. As protests resumed the afternoon of May 29, local leaders were calling for them to remain peaceful. “Our fellow citizens are suffering and distraught and everyone is on edge due to many factors that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 virus,” Archbishop Kurtz said in his letter to the mayor. “The hope promised by our faith is that the crosses we bear can have a transformative effect as we seek, with God’s grace, to build a better future for all.” At about 5:30 p.m. Friday afternoon, 100 or so protestors chanting “No justice, no peace” and “I can’t breathe,” were peacefully blocking the intersection of Sixth and Jefferson streets. Soon after, protestors lay down on the ground to re-enact an arrest, reminiscent of the latest police killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd, one of two recent deaths that sparked the protests. George Floyd, suspected of forgery, was killed by a police officer on Memorial Day and the tragedy was captured on video. He was pinned to the ground as the officer knelt on his neck for eight minutes. Floyd struggles to say, “I can’t breathe,” repeatedly and eventually appears to lose consciousness or die. He was declared dead at a hospital afterward. The other death hits closer to home for Louisville protesters. Emergency medical worker Breonna Taylor, 26, was shot to death March 13 by Louisville Metro Police when officers entered her home in plain clothes on a “no-knock warrant,” meaning they could enter her home without identifying themselves or knocking. Thinking they were being robbed, Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired at the officers, the Associated Press reported. Taylor was shot eight times. The FBI is now investigating. In response to protestors, Mayor Fischer announced May 29 that he would temporarily suspend no-knock warrants. The Metro Louisville chief of police has also announced his retirement in the wake of the Breonna Taylor shooting. In his letter, the archbishop told the mayor that he stands with him. “I know of your commitment to both justice and peace and of your promotion of a compassionate community that does not tolerate racism in any form. I stand with you as we all work to build a better Louisville in which all citizens thrive and in which there is a shared commitment to the common good.” He concluded by pledging the prayers of local Catholics. “I can only imagine the personal toll on you as you have sought to lead well during these difficult days,” he writes. “I can assure you that the parishes and faithful of the archdiocese will be praying for you and for a peaceful and just resolution to this situation.”",0.0

It has to be a Christ-centered response. It starts one person at a time, and it has to start in the church house. The one thing I said today, I came to pray, not to protest. There’s a place for protest, but there’s a place for prayer.” Pastor Leon Slatter LEXINGTON, Ky. (KT) – When Leon Slatter saw the horrific video of the Minnesapolis police officer kneeling on George Floyd’s neck, there was instant sorrow and heartbreak moving through him. But the emotion that raged the most was anger.  The longtime pastor of Cadentown Baptist Church in Lexington said he refused to watch the video at first. But it came around again on a social media feed and he viewed it and quickly was compelled to comment. “This is what I said: Something is wrong. Then I said: Lord Jesus help me.”  Slatter said the second comment was a prayer to God from him. “I’ll tell you why I said that. I got angry. I literally felt anger,” he said. “My prayer was, Lord Jesus, help me, because of the anger. That was for me because of my anger. That’s the reason.”  It was also why Slatter rode his motorcycle to a downtown park in Lexington on a sun-splashed Friday morning not to protest, but to pray for national and state leaders. He went to pray for the president, vice president, congressman, representatives, governors, mayors, the police department and for pastors. He was moved by the spirit to offer heartfelt prayers for these critical leaders and invited viewers on Facebook Live to join him.   “It’s how those of us that know Jesus Christ respond to it,” Slatter said. “It has to be a Christ-centered response. It starts one person at a time, and it has to start in the church house. The one thing I said today, I came to pray, not to protest. There’s a place for protest, but there’s a place for prayer.”  The tragic incident in Minnesota, with the death of George Floyd, spilled over into violent protests across the nation on Thursday with cries of hated and rioting, evil and bloodshed engulfing the land.  The white Minneapolis police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck was arrested on murder charges Friday and accused in court papers of ignoring another officer’s concerns about the handcuffed black man who died after pleading that he could not breathe.  “I’m a firm believer if we want healing in our land, it begins with me,” Slatter said. “The way I respond to it, I start to make the difference. I just believe the only thing that’s going to bring about a change in our country and our communities is for those of us who know Jesus Christ to make a commitment. The love of Jesus negates my human way of seeing things.”  The country has been rocked with the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Louisville. It has stirred hearts to angry levels again in the face of prejudice and racism.  “This whole thing is fueling divisiveness,” Slatter said. “I think, more than anything else, we have to recognize we do have a problem. Honor it by saying yes we have a problem in our land and in our communities.”  Dr. Todd Gray, executive director-treasurer of the Kentucky Baptist Convention, said Proverbs 31:9 calls upon leaders to speak out against injustice.  “The death of George Floyd is an injustice,” he said. “I am praying that George Floyd’s family will receive justice in his wrongful death. We can also listen to our African American brothers and sisters in Christ and offer support. Romans 12:15 calls on all believers to weep with those who weep.”  On Thursday protesters around the country, in cities including Los Angeles, Denver, New York and Memphis, showed up in alliance with demonstrators in Minneapolis where Floyd became the latest black man to die in police custody. Some of the protests turned violent.  “When a black man loses his life through a wrongful death, the African American Christian community grieves,” Gray said. “As a believer, I want to grieve with them. The best way I can grieve is to get on the phone and call and listen to what they are experiencing. The last time I did this, I heard from two black Christian leaders that their wives had shed tears due to their concern over their sons.”  Slatter said the healing starts in the pulpit and comes through the love of Jesus Christ.  “It can conquer what’s going on,” he said. “We are never going to change the entire world. Jesus Christ didn’t do it. Yes, anyone can accept Him or believe and have eternal life, (but) He knew everyone would not receive Him. We’re not going to change everybody.”  Without Jesus working in the midst, nothing will change, Slatter said. “This is what I know: God can change hearts. Hate fuels hate. Hate is a weapon of the enemy. I refuse to be used by the enemy to fight his battle. The enemy is Satan.”  Slatter, who will be 72 in August, has spent nearly half his life as pastor of Cadentown and experienced his share of racism. He says God is at work. “We have to be responsive in a positive way to what God is doing and what He wants to be doing through our churches.”  Praying like he did on Friday morning tops the list of what churches need to be doing, he said.  “We can pray and we should,” Gray said. “We can listen, and we should do that also. We can also try and understand that the root of that anger is that, from the perspective of many in the African American community, this is just one more in a long line of perceived injustices.  “My prayer is for George Floyd’s family to be comforted and to receive justice. We should also pray the gospel will be spread and that God will be glorified even in these situations.”  Cadentown Baptist Church has not returned to in-person services, but Slatter can be heard at 10 a.m. on Facebook Live on the church’s page.",0.0

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Friday night, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, along with Louisville Metro Police had a Zoom news conference about a second night of protests in the city. Fischer said Friday was the worst of the two nights. Mayor Fischer called it ""a very sad night for our city. And as violence raged across many cities in our country, it has been a sad night for America."" Here's the rest of Mayor Fischer's statement: ""There needs to be ample recognition of the underlying inequity that causes so much of this frustration, but there is no excuse for the destruction of property we have seen this evening. This is not protest. It is violence. Many came tonight to express the pain, anger and frustration brought about by the tragic death of Breonna Taylor. Many were here to exercise their First Amendment right to peacefully protest – and I respect that right. Unfortunately, another faction of people used the occasion of a protest as an excuse to cause destruction. Buildings set on fire. Windows broken. Cars vandalized. Businesses looted. This violence and destruction is absolutely unacceptable. It besmirches any claim to honor Breonna Taylor’s memory. Just this morning, Breonna’s family called for peaceful and safe protest. Violence does not bring our city closer to the truth in her case. No one stands up for justice and equality by smashing windows and burning property. This destruction will not be tolerated. LMPD believes that a significant percentage of the protesters came here from outside of Louisville. To citizens of Louisville. I ask you to stay home. Protect our city and work peacefully for change. Destroying our city only make creating the city we want more difficult. My thanks goes to the LMPD officers on duty tonight, who again showed discipline, restraint and professionalism under extremely volatile circumstances. And I also want to thank the law enforcement who came in to assist from other agencies. Again, to all the peaceful protesters who marched tonight in Breonna Taylor’s name and to the many people marching with them in spirit – I want you to know I hear you, your city hears you and the country hears you. My administration has taken swift action to respond to your concerns, to get to the truth in the Breonna Taylor case and to create a greater sense of police community legitimacy. Let’s remember that there is only one way forward, and that’s working together. Working for truth, working for peace. For Breonna, her family and for all of Louisville. Let’s work together, work through these challenges and build our city up – for everyone. That is our only path forward.""",0.0

Activists said it's another example of systematic racism in law enforcement, the latest in a series of high-profile black deaths that have exacerbated and inflamed racial tensions nationwide. Former officer Derek Chauvin faces third-degree murder and manslaughter charges after a bystander's video circulated of him holding his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes before Floyd died. 'What's it going to take to get people to listen?'George Floyd protests in Minneapolis continue into fourth night despite curfew A 19-year-old man was shot and killed late Friday night during protests in Detroit, and Atlanta's mayor delivered an impassioned plea for violence to stop. One protester died in St. Louis, and one federal contract security officer was shot in Oakland, California. Demonstrators in many cities gathered to protest local deaths at the hands of law enforcement: In Indianapolis, protesters held a sign that read ""Justice for Dreasjon Reed."" Reed died after a police pursuit that was broadcast on Facebook Live. In Milwaukee, they invoked the name of Joel Acevedo, who died after an altercation with a police officer in April. In Louisville, Kentucky, on Thursday night, gunfire erupted as hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed in her apartment by police in March. As protests continue into their fourth night in Minneapolis, here's a look at what happened overnight around the USA: St. Louis: Protesters block interstate, one dies Protesters blocked a downtown interstate for about three hours Friday evening. One truck driver rerouted off the interstate was stopped by protesters, and several people started looting his trailer, two displaying guns to the driver, according to police. As the driver attempted to drive away, one person was caught between the two trailers and run over. There were no arrests, police said. Milwaukee: Protesters march in 'solidarity,' stop Interstate 43 traffic More than a dozen businesses were damaged, and about 50 people were arrested overnight Friday, Police Chief Alfonso Morales said Saturday in a news release. The daylong protests Friday had been peaceful as hundreds marched around the city. But around 11:30 p.m., violent unrest broke out around the District 5 Police Station, near Locust Street and King Drive. ""Instead of protesting in the honor of Mr. George Floyd and Mr. Joel Acevedo, many individuals, used this as an opportunity to damage property, destroy businesses, commit robbery, fire shots and steal property for their personal gain,"" Morales said in the release. An officer was shot and injured in the line of duty. ""Thank God, the officer’s injury was non-life-threatening,"" the chief said. – Ashley Luthern, Ricardo Torres and Talis Shelbourne, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Greenville, SC: Hundreds gather for peaceful rally About 200 people, and more by the minute, gathered Saturday morning for a peaceful protest in response to Floyd's death. Dalores Bowens, one of the organizers, said the goal of the protest was to highlight the risks that black people, and others, face at times from police. The big aim, she said, is to encourage unity and have a peaceful expression of anger and frustration. – Mike Ellis, Eric Connor and Sarah Sheridan, Greenville News Pensacola, Fla.: 'Tymar is our George' About 300 to 400 people filled the southern banks of the small hills that flank Graffiti Bridge to express outrage over police violence against African Americans. Advertised as a vigil, the atmosphere felt more like a protest, and its organizers explained its purpose as twofold: a show of communal objection to police brutality and a lamentation for Tymar Crawford. Crawford, 28, was shot and killed by Police Department Detective Daniel Siemen on July 5, 2019. Siemen was fired from the PPD for violating the department's use of deadly force policy, but a grand jury determined there was not enough evidence to warrant criminal charges. ""Tymar is our Pensacola George,"" activist Haley Morrissette said. ""This really shows the energy that is really behind getting justice in the county and here, right now. A lot of people are here to remind us that Tymar is Pensacola's George."" – Colin Warren-Hicks, Pensacola News Journal Oakland, Calif.: 'Damage and destruction,' 1 dead in shooting Interim Police Chief Susan Manheimer said peaceful demonstration turned ""disruptive."" ""We saw damage and destruction here,"" Manheimer said in a video message posted to Twitter. Two contract security officers for the Federal Protective Service of the Department of Homeland Security were shot, one fatally, when someone began firing from a vehicle outside the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building Friday night, FBI San Francisco said in a statement. The FBI could not say whether the shooting was related to protests because the investigation was ongoing, according to public affairs officer Katherine Zackel. The FBI deployed investigators to the scene and was working with the Police Department, Zackel said. Portland, Ore.: Multiple arrests, state of emergency, curfew A police spokesperson said 13 people were arrested overnight. Police called the protests ""riots."" Mayor Ted Wheeler declared a state of emergency early Saturday and said a curfew was ""immediately in effect"" until 6 a.m. local time, then would resume 8 p.m. Saturday. Wheeler released a series of tweets Friday night saying, ""ENOUGH"" and ""Portland, this is NOT us."" ""Burning buildings with people inside, stealing from small and large businesses, threatening and harassing reporters. All in the middle of a pandemic where people have already lost everything. This isn’t calling for meaningful change in our communities, this is disgusting,"" Wheeler said on Twitter. Houston: Nearly 200 arrested Nearly 200 people were arrested Friday into Saturday morning, and most will be charged with obstructing a roadway, police said on Twitter. Four officers had minor injuries, and eight police vehicles were damaged, police said. Earlier in the day, Police Chief Art Acevedo attended a downtown demonstration organized by Black Lives Matter and spoke to the crowd. ""It’s about bad policing. It’s about criminal behavior. And it’s about holding bad cops accountable,"" Acevedo told the group as many booed. Later, dozens of protesters shut down U.S. Highway 59. Lincoln, Neb.: Protesters arrested, shelter-in-place order Protests condemning police brutality began early in the morning at the Capitol. Around 4 a.m. Saturday, police said the protest was no longer peaceful. ""Arrests have been made and will continue to be made for those who continue to break the law. Neighbors in the area please shelter in place,"" the department said on Twitter. Austin, Texas: Dozens protest at police headquarters About a hundred protesters denouncing police brutality and Floyd's death gathered in front of the Police Department’s headquarters downtown around midnight Saturday. A line of officers wearing helmets and batons formed in front of the building and blocked the Interstate 35 service road near East Seventh Street. Officers clashed with demonstrators and pushed them back to the street. Police detained at least one protester, though it was not immediately known why. Protesters chanted, “I can’t breathe” and threw water bottles at the officers. Officers responded by firing bean bag shots. One officer had cuts on his face and one of his elbows; he said he wasn’t sure at what point during the protest he was injured. – Andy Sevilla, Austin American-Statesman Elmira, NY: 'We've had enough' A crowd of about 50 stood outside the Police Department on Friday, chanting – at times in the rain – ""No justice, no peace,"" and ""Black lives matter"" to peacefully demonstrate. Participants stayed for hours Friday, the second consecutive day of demonstrating. Organizer Domari Greene, 30, said plans are to gather again Saturday. ""The message we’re sending out is that not only is the African American community tired of the unjust killings and racism, but people across the nation are also tired of this,"" Greene said Friday. ""We’ve had enough, and no more will officers get away for their crimes, no more just a suspension."" ""We had some interaction with the group, and it was very positive,"" Police Capt. Anthony Alvernaz said, adding he wished motorists would slow down as their speed endangered the group. – Ashley Biviano, Elmira Star-Gazette Chicago: Protesters march downtown; more than 100 arrested Dozens of protesters wearing face masks – many with the communist group Revolution Club Chicago and the organization Refuse Fascism Now, which calls for President Donald Trump’s removal – gathered downtown and marched through the streets for hours Friday evening. The group chanted, ""Say his name, George Floyd"" and ""Black lives matter."" Some held signs that said ""Justice 4 George"" and ""I can’t breathe."" The group blocked a major highway, stopping traffic as police created a barricade with their bicycles. Later, the group stopped outside the Metropolitan Correctional Center and chanted, ""We love you,"" according to videos posted to social media. The peaceful protest took a turn early Saturday morning, when demonstrators broke the windows of several downtown storefronts. About 108 people were arrested, Superintendent David Brown said in a news conference Saturday. ""We had to take swift action so that the violence and property damage wouldn’t escalate,"" he said. The protesters inflected ""minimal damage"" downtown, and about a dozen squad cars were damaged throughout the city, Brown said. Some officers were injured, and one had a broken wrist. Illinois State Police assisted Chicago police ""with several crowds of protesters"" from Friday evening to 4 a.m. Saturday, according to the agency. State police did not make any arrests, the agency said. More than 10,000 people expressed interest in a Facebook event page for a protest Saturday afternoon in Chicago, organized by Black Lives Matter. – Grace Hauck, USA TODAY Columbus, Ohio: 5 arrested, 2 police officers injured Five people were arrested and two police officers were injured by protesters throwing rocks and bricks at them on the second straight night of protests in Ohio's capital city. Police reported broken windows and spray-paint graffiti in the Short North. Business owners boarded up their buildings, and a couple stood outside well after midnight, armed with guns, to protect their properties. Protesters converged earlier in the night on police headquarters, where they staged a peaceful protest. – Mark Ferenchik and Catherine Candisky, The Columbus Dispatch Denver: Police use flash grenades, tear gas to hold off protesters at Capitol On the night after one protester appeared to be intentionally hit by a car, police used flash grenades and tear gas to hold off protesters as they attempted to breach the Capitol multiple times. People began to gather as early as 12:30 p.m. for a march to the Capitol, where protesters stood on the steps and chanted for change. They took both sides of nearby North Broadway Street before heading to Civic Center Park to hear from speakers. About an hour after the crowd had mostly dispersed, they regathered near the Capitol, prompting law enforcement to push them back from the street to keep traffic moving through the area. Tensions escalated into the night, and some protesters ran through the city, smashing storefront windows. – Bethany Baker, The Coloradoan (Fort Collins, Colorado) Des Moines, Iowa: Protest grows violent, bricks thrown at police cars A protest outside police headquarters spread through downtown and turned violent. Just before 8 p.m., protesters threw bricks at police cars, prompting officers in riot gear to push against protesters. At least one officer sprayed chemical irritants on the crowd, including a Des Moines Register photographer. – Andrea May Sahouri, Des Moines Register Detroit: 19-year-old man killed; police arrest 9 people, fire tear gas amid protests A 19-year-old man was killed late Friday night after shots were fired into a crowd of protesters by an unknown suspect in a gray Dodge Durango. Video obtained by the Free Press of the USA TODAY Network showed the man bleeding from the chest, and police said he died at a hospital. About 1,500 people demonstrated peacefully earlier in the night. Police Chief James Craig said nine people were arrested as of 11 p.m. By 11:45 p.m., police had fired tear gas. Officers were attacked during the demonstrations, Craig said. A command officer was struck with a rock and taken to a hospital. An officer on a bike was struck. The Police Department is angry about Floyd's death, too, Craig said: “I will not stand by and let a small minority, criminals, come in here, attack our officers and make our community unsafe."" – Darcie Moran, Angie Jackson, Joe Guillen and Branden Hunter, Detroit Free Press Indianapolis: Police use rubber bullets, tear gas Protesters clashed with police downtown in an hourslong demonstration that started peacefully but turned chaotic after the sun went down. Officers with the Metropolitan Police Department used volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse crowds that lingered on city streets well past midnight. As police stood in riot gear, groups of protesters moved through clouds of gas, chanting, “I can’t breathe!” and “Black lives matter.” George Floyd protests:How did we get here? A patrol car was vandalized. Fires were set in trash cans. A CVS was torched and looted, as were a a jewelry business and a cellphone store. Graffiti on a broken window at Key Bank at Market Tower read, “I can’t use my bank account if I’m dead.” – Crystal Hill, Vic Ryckaert, Kelly Wilkinson, Jenna Watson and Ryan Martin, Indianapolis Star Knoxville, Tenn.: Protesters rally, chant outside police headquarters Hundreds of protesters gathered peacefully in front of police headquarters in a rally hosted by Black Lives Matter Knoxville. Davis Hayes, who ran for City Council last year, led the crowd in a chant: “We have nothing to lose for our chains.” Alison Rose, who works with the National Alliance on Mental Illness, was the first white speaker at the protest, and she spoke directly to other white people. “White people, get it together. Do the work. Educate yourselves,” she said. “Get yourself so deep in history that you will find out the truth: Black history is this country’s history.” – Travis Dorman, Knoxville News Sentinel Los Angeles: Police declare unlawful assembly amid growing tensions The Police Department declared an unlawful assembly after 9:30 p.m. for much of the downtown area, from Interstate 10 to U.S. 101, and the 110 Freeway to Alameda Street, after a night of tense standoffs with protesters. “This is being made following repeated acts of violence and property damage. Residents should stay inside. Business should close. Those on the street are to leave the area,” the LAPD said via Twitter. Hours earlier, protesters blocked the 110 Freeway, temporarily stopping traffic. Louisville, Ky.: Demonstrators gather again after violence Thursday After violent protests erupted Thursday, protesters continued to gather Friday night, demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, an African American woman killed in her apartment by police officers in March. People trashed buildings, broke glass, set fires and looted restaurants in an eight-hour protest that stretched into early Saturday morning, and angry city officials blamed out-of-towners for the trail of vandalism across much of downtown. ""This is not a protest. It is violence,"" Mayor Greg Fischer said at 1 a.m. in a video call with reporters. ""This violence and destruction is absolutely unacceptable,"" he said. ""It besmirches any claim to honor Breonna Taylor's memory. ... No one stands up for justice and equality by smashing windows and burning property. This destruction will not be tolerated."" – Tessa Duvall, Mandy McLaren, Darcy Costello, Cameron Teague Robinson, Bailey Loosemore and Sarah Ladd, Louisville Courier Journal Memphis, Tenn.: About 300 protesters gather for third straight day For the third straight day, protesters took to the streets to speak out against police brutality and the deaths of three African Americans at the hands of police. The first demonstrators arrived just before 6:30 p.m. Within an hour, the crowd had grown to about 300, the largest of the protests. That was despite a series of road closures set up by the Police Department at every entrance into the area. – Desiree Stennett, Micaela A Watts and Laura Testino, The Commercial Appeal (Memphis) New York City: A 'long night ahead' amid escalating tensions in Brooklyn Mayor Bill de Blasio warned of a ""long night ahead of us in Brooklyn"" in a tweet late Friday night. Reporters documented the unrest in social media posts: Earlier in the evening, New York Times reporter Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs tweeted a video showing a person being struck by the door of a passing police vehicle. Jason Lemon of Newsweek tweeted a photo of a police vehicle set on fire in the borough. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted that lawmakers were among the protesters who were caught up in the clash: ""A Black New York State Senator (@zellnor4ny) and a Black NYS Assemblywoman (@YourFavoriteASW) were both pepper sprayed in Brooklyn today. They were present as elected leaders to keep the peace and serve their communities. Completely, utterly unacceptable."" In Manhattan, hundreds of protesters descended on Foley Square, chanting, ""I can't breathe"" and “No justice, no peace!” Phoenix: Hundreds march against violence after peaceful vigil A vigil ""to mourn the police violence"" wrapped up shortly after 9 p.m., and organizers discouraged attendees from engaging in any violent protesting and urged them to go home. Though some left, hundreds of protesters began marching. Many had their hands in the air and chanted, ""I can't breathe."" An organizer said violence would bring more pain to the family of Dion Johnson, who was fatally shot by an officer. Police said Johnson, 28, was shot after a struggle with a trooper May 25. Activist groups demanded release of the body-worn camera footage depicting the shooting. – BrieAnna J. Frank, Andrew Oxford and Helena Wegner, Arizona Republic San Jose, Calif.: Protesters block five-lane Silicon Valley freeway Protesters marched through the capital of the Silicon Valley, stalling traffic for about an hour on a five-lane freeway and prompting police intervention. Video footage from KGO-TV showed vehicles at a virtual standstill on the southbound lanes of U.S. 101 until protesters moved into the downtown area. Police fired tear gas and nonlethal projectiles into a crowd that had grown to about 1,000 people, and officers in riot gear lined up to prevent them from further disrupting traffic near City Hall, KPIX-TV reported. Protesters smashed the windows of police cars and threw water bottles. Elsewhere in California, hundreds of protesters demonstrated peacefully on the streets in the capital city of Sacramento, gathering near a police headquarters and shouting at police. Seattle: Reports of pepper spray, fireworks Protesters and police clashed downtown, the Seattle Times reported. Protesters broke windows and threw fireworks; police responded with tear gas, the paper reported. Washington: Pennsylvania Avenue protesters force White House lockdown Angry protesters arrived at Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to a lockdown at the White House Friday night, spokesman Judd Deere confirmed to USA TODAY. Outside the White House on Friday, the Secret Service took at least one person into custody. A large group of protesters gathered, some burning flags and knocking over barricades. The protesters moved from the White House to another part of the city. Reporters inside the White House said the Secret Service would not let them leave the grounds during the lockdown. – Savannah Behrmann, USA TODAY Contributing: Steve Kiggins, USA TODAY; The Associated Press",0.0
1620723930,2020-05-30 02:57:50,"Greg Fischer, Louisville police blame looting at Breonna Taylor protest on out-of-towners",http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625578976/0/courierjournal/home~Greg-Fischer-Louisville-police-blame-looting-at-Breonna-Taylor-protest-on-outoftowners/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"CLOSE So who was to blame for the widespread damage that upended downtown Louisville at Friday night's protest? Mayor Greg Fischer is confident he has the answer. Louisville Metro Police officials believe ""a significant percentage of the protesters came from outside of our city,"" an angered Fischer said after 1 a.m. Saturday morning in a teleconference addressing the chaos of the night. They were the ones, he said, who broke windows and took part in looting, which had not been an issue at the protest a night earlier. ""They seem to be people that do this type of activity regularly, unfortunately, around the country,"" Fischer said. Friday recap: Hundreds fill Louisville streets for 2nd straight night of protests Read more: What to know about investigations into the shooting of Breonna Taylor The mayor had plenty of praise for Louisville police officers, thanking them repeatedly for showing restraint throughout the night (only two arrests were reported, though officers fired tear gas into crowds several times and one officer was seen intentionally firing a weapon at a WAVE3 TV crew). And he thanked those protesters who were peaceful during the hourslong demonstration, which took place to call for justice following the shooting of Breonna Taylor by Louisville police. But local law enforcement officials had several clues that protesters from out of town came to Louisville on Friday with the intent of causing damage, Fischer said. Buy Photo Windows were broken out at Subway on 6th Street on Friday, May 29, 2020. (Photo: Michael Clevenger/Courier Journal) A lot of protesters, he said, were asking officers for directions around town, and LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said earlier in the evening that she was sure the larger crowd at Friday's protest was due to demonstrators from outside the city. Louisville police had been tracking social media posts, she said, and learned of buses coming from Indianapolis for the protests. Officers had also seen a notable number of cars with license plates from outside Kentucky. “It’s been a high-profile conversation, and obviously we use a lot of intelligence about what’s occurring,” Halladay said. “With an active social media platform we can see a lot of people traveled here for this tonight.” Only two arrests took place Friday night, police said, but Halladay said department officials would make an effort to figure out who was behind some of the vandalism and looting — the Omni Louisville Hotel, Kentucky International Convention Center and several other downtown businesses were hit hard. ""This is a really difficult, fluid situation to manage, especially when you know you have people who are not local who are coming in with the sole purpose of agitating and creating disturbance and division, frankly, between the residents of this community and the police who've worked so hard to protect those residents,"" Halladay said. ""We're doing what we can monitoring intelligence channels, watching social media, and we hope to be able to identify some of these folks so that we can bring them to justice for the destruction they've caused here. ""There are a lot of non-Louisvillians here,"" she concluded, ""causing significant damage to our city."" Kentucky coronavirus map: How many cases are in Kentucky? Where are they? Fischer urged those who live in the city to stay home this weekend to help officers get control of the situation. He noted that city officials would ""assess every option"" ahead of Saturday evening and could call in other law enforcement agencies, including the National Guard, to help keep the peace at Saturday's demonstrations as the city continues to address the grievances that arose from Taylor's killing. ""Once the out-of-town people leave, we still have to rebuild our city,"" he said. ""And I don't know anybody is from our great city that wants to destroy it.""

""It besmirches any claim to honor Breonna Taylor's memory. ... No one stands up for justice and equality by smashing windows and burning property. This destruction will not be tolerated."" For the second night in a row, people took to the streets en masse to protest the fatal shooting of Taylor, an unarmed African American who died in her apartment after being shot at least eight times by Louisville Metro Police in March. Taylor, an ER tech, was at her southwest Louisville apartment when police entered her home on a ""no-knock"" search warrant related to a narcotics investigation. Officers returned fire after Taylor's boyfriend fired a shot at what he said he believed to be intruders. No drugs were recovered from the apartment. Read more: Hundreds fill Louisville streets for 2nd straight night of protests over Breonna Taylor shooting Related: Video clip shows officer shooting pellets at Louisville reporter at protest There were no altercations between protesters and police Friday, and, unlike the night before, there were no reports of gunfire in the crowd. City officials reported two arrests, and a television news crew was taken to the hospital. But vandals did significant damage across downtown: Windows to office buildings, at least one hotel and restaurants were smashed. Looters sidestepped broken windows and rummaged through the bar area of Eddie Merlot's Prime Aged Beef & Seafood, hauling away armfuls of alcohol. A similar smash-and-grab unfolded on live TV at the Omni Louisville Hotel on South Second Street, with looters sprinting away with bottles of booze. Throughout the night, Courier Journal reporters and photographers saw canisters of tear gas being fired; heard flash bangs exploding; and spotted numerous fires in trash cans and recycling bins. Shards of glass were everywhere, and anti-police graffiti was spray-painted on buildings and sidewalks. Editorial: Louisville must listen to protesters in Breonna Taylor case and battle injustice ""This has been a very sad night for our city,"" Fischer said. ""Many came tonight to express the pain, anger and frustration brought about by the tragic death of Breonna Taylor. Many were here to exercise their First Amendment right to peacefully protest — and I respect that right. ""Unfortunately,"" the mayor continued, ""another faction of people use the occasion of a protest as an excuse to cause destruction."" Jessie Halladay, a spokeswoman for Louisville Metro Police, also pointed to out-of-towners as the reason for much of the chaos and damage. ""They're determined to create division within this community,"" she said. ""They are well-equipped. They bring sticks, bottles, bats, shields, guns. They are ready to set fires. They come well-stocked with water, supplies, other things. They are ready to start problems."" Friday night's unrest followed a smaller, but still raucous, protest Thursday that left seven people with gunshot wounds, including one in critical condition. Those shots were not fired by police, LMPD said. Taylor's death is one of a number of high-profile killings of black Americans, several at the hands of police officers, that have sparked protests across the country. Protesters in recent days have taken to the streets for George Floyd, a black man killed by Minneapolis police in an incident captured on video. Floyd's death came at a time when many Americas were already outraged over the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, who was jogging in a south Georgia neighborhood when he was killed by white men. In Louisville, protesters carried signs and chanted about both Taylor and Floyd. Around 11 p.m., a small group of protesters walked down Bardstown Road, followed by a line of police vehicles. Dozens of cars honked their horns in support. More protest news: Are more protests planned in Louisville over Breonna Taylor's shooting? Background: Who was Breonna Taylor? What we know about the Louisville ER tech fatally shot by police People on sidewalks handed out water, reminding the crowd to stay hydrated, while chants of “hands up, don’t shoot” filled the air. At Eastern Parkway, the protesters paused and knelt in the intersection, taking a brief moment of silence before walking back up Bardstown toward downtown. Chanting throughout the night included “Breonna Taylor,” “No justice, no peace” and “F*** the police.” As the group moved past a line of police officers blocking the entrance to the Mid-City Mall, several leaders also urged the group to “keep moving” and repeated that “this is a peaceful protest.” Helicopters buzzed above the unrest for hours, their spotlights illuminating both tense confrontations and periods of standstill. By midnight, empty milk jugs and crushed plastic water bottles littered the street in front of Metro Hall, where a handful of protesters remained — silently refusing to budge for the line of more than 50 officers in riot gear that had sought to advance. Earlier in the evening, tensions rose as protesters spotted law enforcement officers inside the Hall of Justice. Protesters ripped the American and Kentucky flags from their poles in front of the building, using lighters and alcohol to set them ablaze.

Cincinnati City Council member Jeff Pastor looks on during at a City Council Budget and Finance meeting on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2020, at City Hall in downtown Cincinnati. (Photo: Albert Cesare / The Enquirer) What Pastor told Battipaglia: ""I've been down here and we first started on Main Street. And I saw that they were coming and they were getting a little aggressive. And so my idea was not necessarily just to protect the cops but it was just to protect the people. And what I can't understand is that this is Cincinnati police. This is not Minneapolis police. And what they're doing is just absolutely horrendous. As a member of City Council, this is my first time ever seeing something like this. When this first happened in 2001, I was only 17 years old, right? I can't understand for the life of me what is going on right now in the city of Cincinnati. And I'm gonna be here until these folks and other folks that are protecting. ... Let me tell you something: There are people down here who are encouraging 14-year-old kids. These babies are 14 years old, man, and they're encouraging them to throw bottles at these f---ing cops. And these grown people are encouraging our babies to fight. This is not their fight! And I don't give a f--- how mad or angry you are with the f---ing - what's happening with the police. But these 15-year-old kids have nothing to do with this, man. And these cops - black cops, white cops ... they did not do anything! And I'm not here to take one side or the other. But what I'm suggesting to the people of Cincinnati is that what type of success are you going to have with attacking these people that have nothing to do with this? And what I'm saying is is that you've got people down here who are literally encouraging kids to attack cops. You are encouraging the kids to attack cops! And they're using Martin Luther King to justify why these 14- and 15-year-old kids should be out here. These are former students of mine! You see what I'm saying? I am imploring that before this pops and this gets bad - they're throwing bricks! They just threw a brick at these f---ing cops! And it's wrong! I'm telling you it's wrong! And I'm so nervous and I'm so scared for these kids! These are kids! There are kids across the street who live downtown ... and these people are out here encouraging them. And as an elder in the African American community - if any African American is encouraging these 14- and 15-year-old kids to be out here, they are f---ing wrong! Just wrong! These cops didn't do anything to George Floyd! They're just wrong! I don't give a f--- how you see it - it's wrong! And sorry for cussing!""

(@mckinley_moore via AP) PHOTO:@mckinley_moore via AP Seven Shot at Louisville Protest By The Associated Press LOUISVILLE - At least seven people were shot in Louisville as protesters turned out to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March. Louisville Metro Police confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were “some arrests,” but police didn't provide a number. “No officers discharged their service weapons,” police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Washington said that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city's downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. The protests stretched for more than six hours, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. “Understandably, emotions are high,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor's mother. “As Breonna's mother says let's be peaceful as we work toward truth and justice.” Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home. Attention on Taylor's death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February. Thursday's demonstration came as protesters across the country — from Los Angeles to Memphis, Tennessee, to New York to Minneapolis itself — have demonstrated against the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody. Around 12:20 a.m., Fischer tweeted a video that he said was a message from Taylor's family. “Louisville, thank you so much for saying Breonna's name tonight. We are not going to stop until we get justice,” a woman says in the video. “But we should stop tonight before people get hurt. Please go home, be safe and be ready to keep fighting.” Meanwhile, live video from downtown Louisville around 12:30 a.m. showed some protesters behind makeshift wooden barricades, which appeared to be made out of picnic tables spray-painted with the words “You can’t kill us all.” A small fire inside a trash can was visible in the middle of the street. Police in body armor and face shields held batons and lined up around Louisville City Hall. They appeared to fire rubber bullets and deploy tear gas canisters, fogging the air and inducing coughs among the remaining members of the crowd. Protesters were shown filming police with their cellphones. Kentuckians are still under social distancing mandates driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Many protesters wore masks. Chants early Friday included “No justice, no peace” and “Whose streets? Our streets.”",0.0

(Darnella Frazier via AP, File) PHOTO:Darnella Frazier via AP, File Cop Who Knelt on Man's Neck Charged with Murder By The Associated Press MINNEAPOLIS - The police officer who was seen on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in custody after pleading that he could not breathe, was arrested Friday and charged with murder in a case that sparked protests across the United States and violence in Minneapolis. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Freeman did not provide immediate details, but said a criminal complaint would be made available later Friday and that more charges were possible. In the video, Chauvin is seen kneeling on Floyd's neck as Floyd is on the ground. He gradually becomes motionless as Chauvin and three other officers ignore bystanders’ shouts to get off him. Freeman said the investigation continues into the other three officers, but that authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Freeman highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd’s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video by a bystander. He said he would not bring a case unless he had enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Protests in Minneapolis escalated in violence on Thursday, when demonstrators torched a police station that officers had abandoned. “I’m not insensitive to what happened in the streets,” Freeman said. “My own home has been picketed regularly.” All four officers who were at the scene of Floyd's death were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside the government center chanted, “All four got to go.” News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state would take over the response to the violence and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district “on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen.” His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said. “You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said. On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station. Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street, doing what they could to help. Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention. “I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said. Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it. Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis. A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What's the plan here?” “With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.” He defended the city's lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs. The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,"" and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights."" Walz publicly apologized on Friday. Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing members of Floyd's family, called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd's body to have an independent autopsy performed. Floyd said that talk of a heart condition or asthma is irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police. The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner as well. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis. About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff's Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area. In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March. In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd's death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” In a follow-up tweet, he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable."" The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk"" and said he was ""not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect. State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd's death. The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said that Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events that featured African-American music, Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press. Santamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, “he might have given him a little more mercy.” Santamaria, who sold the venue within the past two months, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but did not like to work the African American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified “overkill.”",0.0

The FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death.Hundreds flocked downtown Thursday night, and on Friday, it happened again — people demanding justice in the death of Taylor, as well as two minority men recently killed.Details of the case remained quiet for several weeks, but gained national attention after video of the Ahmaud Arbery shooting death in Georgia was made public. Activists across the country began speaking out about the deaths of unarmed black citizens at the hands of police and/or racist white people.In March, Taylor was shot at least eight times when three officers forcibly entered her apartment to serve a search warrant in a narcotics investigation. The department said the men announced themselves and returned gunfire when Taylor's boyfriend fired at them.But in a wrongful death lawsuit, Taylor's mother says the officers didn't knock at all and should've called off their search because the suspect they sought had already been arrested.Officers didn't find drugs in her apartment when they entered, Taylor's mother said in the lawsuit.In the weeks leading up to Thursday’s violent protest, Taylor’s family called for the LMPD officers involved in the case to be relieved of their duties and charged. Activists held a candlelight vigil, a parade and a wreath-laying ceremony to bring attention to the case. The events were all held peacefully, and Taylor's mother said she would like it to remain that way. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported.A police officer was seen on camera during a WAVE-TV broadcast firing what appeared to be pepper bullets directly at the camera crew.“I'm getting shot! I'm getting shot!” WAVE-TV reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera. She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away.Seven people were shot during Thursday’s rally.

It is violence.' Share Shares Copy Link Copy Hide Transcript Show Transcript Good morning and good evening, everybody. I'm Eric Eric Fisher. Tonight, Louisville saw a second night of protest on our streets. This has been a very sad night for our city, and his violence has raged across many cities in our country. It has been a sad night for America. There does need to be ample recognition of the underlying inequity that causes so much of the frustration that we see in America in our city. But there is no excuse for this. Just for that, there is no excuse for the destruction of property we have seen this evening. This is not protest. It is violence. Many came tonight to express the pain, anger and frustration brought about by the tragic death of Briana Taylor. Many were here to exercise their First Amendment right to peacefully protest. And I respect that right. Unfortunately, another faction of people used the occasion of a protest as an excuse to cause destruction. Buildings set on fire windows broken, cars vandalized, businesses looted. This violence and destruction is absolutely unacceptable. It besmirches any claim to honor Briana Taylor's memory. Just this morning, Brianna's family called from peace and safe protest. Violence does not bring our suit. Faith, Protest violence does not bring our city closer to the truth. In her case, no one stands up for justice inequality by smashing windows and burning property. This destruction, this destruction will not be tolerated. Ln p d believes that a significant percentage of the protesters came from outside of our city To the citizens of Louisville. I ask you to stay home, protect our city and work peacefully for change. Destroying our city Onley makes creating the city. We want even more difficult. My thanks Go to the L A p d officers on duty tonight who again showed discipline and restraint and professionalism under extremely volatile circumstances. And I also want to thank the law enforcement who came in to assist from other agencies again. To all the peaceful protesters who marched tonight in Briana Taylor's name into the many people marching with them in spirit. I want you to know that I hear you your city here's you in your country, hears you. My administration has taken swift action to respond to your concerns, to get to the truth in this case and to create a great greater sense of police community legitimacy Let's remember that there is only one way forward, and that's working together, working for truth and working for peace, For Briana, for her family and all of Louisville. Let's work together, work through these challenges and build our city up for everyone. That is the only pathway forward. But that will be happy to take any questions. Our first question. Sound here with Kate. With wf pl Business owners were saying they suffered significant damage with no sign of police. Why did it take so long to deploy officers to four Street during the looting? Jesse, do you want to take those questions? Sure, Mayor. You know, in situations like we're facing tonight, we've had crowds that have spread out from, um, downtown, all the way up through to Eastern Parkway M Barts Town Road. Our officers primary concern is, um, safety of life. And we have had significant challenges in trying Teoh, make sure that officers could get where they need to be throughout the evening. Um, but again, our officers air doing the best they can, but we're managing a crowd, and that is difficult. We also know that there are challenges to creating conflict between officers and individuals who were trying to stay. It's hands off. We can protect as much, um, safety of life as we can. And unfortunately, there is a lot of property damage, and we're doing our best to try to manage this crowd that's creating that damage. Okay, there's a question on here. Why keep 50 officers lined up across Jefferson Street when the crowd has largely dispersed? You know, again, this is a situation of crowd management and how we are trying to make sure that we can control how the movements are going. And it is very difficult when the crowd has dispersed into these separate groups to try to keep a handle on that so that we can monitor what's going on, um, and try to protect the safety of people. Um, and unfortunately, the property damage is occurring along the way that our primary focus is to keep everyone safe. Kammen from The Courier Journal, is asking Mayor, do you believe that more out of towners will come this weekend for more protests, and so do you think you will need to reach out to the National Guard or any authorities to help control the violence and property damage you mentioned tonight. This is one of the reasons I'm asking little billions to stay home. There is a significant escalation people from out of town here tonight that's clear, that they're asking directions on how to get around our city. We don't recognize the folks. They seem to be people that do this type of activity regularly. Unfortunately, around the country, in one way, we can help our cities by little billions to stay on s so that we can have a more manageable situation. In terms of the National Guard, they will assessed every option that we have right now to make sure that we have the right resource is to deal with anything here tomorrow, Josh with three. Okay. Why do you have any update on injuries or arrest? Just the argument. Yeah, Josh, at this point, we're still aware of just to arrest, as I mentioned earlier. That may be changing on the ground, and we're not hearing about it quite yet up here, but still it too. And we have had I know At least one news crew, um, was attacked during this event and had damage in one of their cameramen. Had to be taken to the hospital. I'm not aware of any other significant injuries at this time. That doesn't mean they haven't occurred. Marcus Green eyes were specific plan to address the faction you all believe was responsible for the significant damage tonight. You know, again, as I've been saying all night, I mean, this is a really difficult, fluid situation to manage. Especially when you know you have people who are not local. We're coming in with the sole purpose of agitating and creating disturbance and division. Frankly, between the residents of this community and the police work so hard to protect those residents. And we are doing what we can. Monitoring intelligence channels, watching social media. And we hope to be able to identify some of these folks so that we can bring them to justice for the destruction they have caused. Your eyes. There any information from which cities or states there coming Trump from Jeff H. A s. You know, I mean, we've I'm just watching it on TV, you know? You see license plates from our surrounding states. A zai mentioned in our previous free thing. Um, we'd seen social media posts all day talking about people coming from places in Indiana, Tennessee? Um, you know, it's it's hard to know. Um and I know someone ask me off line about, um how how many people that is, we have, ah, very large crowd. It's hard for us to even estimate the total of that crowd, so to give a per senator to know. But we do know for monitoring social media and the information that's been given to media reports. There are a lot of nominal civilians here causing significant damage to our city without a C, no more questions. So let me just close by saying for us is Louisville Yin's on The question is, what is it you could control? We can control peaceful protest. But I would ask, after two nights of protests, please stay home. Fewer people out on our streets, the easier it is gonna be able to control the situation and reduce the damage to our city. Once the Uptown people leave, we still have to rebuild our city. And I don't know anybody is from our great city that wants to destroy it. Secondly, let's work together to solve the Briana Taylor grievances. Most all of them have been addressed. And the last thing I want to say is I want to thank L MPD again for the showing tremendous restraint and professionalism tonight and last night under some very, very difficult circumstances. So I appreciate what they've done. All the other agencies that have come to town to try to make this is peaceful, possible so againt. Although civilians, please stay home. Please respect the memory and what we're trying to get done here as we try to get to the truth of this case and understand that all of America is going through this here tonight as well. So let's pray for the future of our country. Thank you. SIGN UP FOR BREAKING NEWS Get local stories sent straight to your inbox as news breaks. Submit Privacy Notice",0.0

These air obviously very trying times in our community. It is a difficult thing. Quite frankly, too. I know that it is. It would be wise for people to become, but also to feel the rage in your own heart. Our community is hurting. Hundreds took to the streets last night to express their sorrow and outrage not only at the senseless murder of Rianna Taylor and unlawful imprisonment of Kenneth Walker, but the complete lack of response to the constant and inhumane trauma being inflicted by those who are supposed to be responsible for our protection. All black people have ever asked is to be seen and heard fully as human beings. We have repeatedly asked for our humanity, our pain, our sorrow to be recognized. Our treatment and the subsequent response to that treatment is a clear sign that these calls have gone unanswered. We do see the mayor's efforts, and we acknowledge that we are the only city in the country with a mayor that has called for a suspension of no knock warrants. But we know there is more to do. We can't change people's hearts, but we can certainly demand that their behavior be changed. And that is what the protest last night were about. People want accountability, accountability for officers who can do better and chills not to. In black communities. We are beyond tired. Briana Taylor is not the first. But we are committed to making her the last in this community. So we weren't really involved. Investigations followed by termination and full prosecutions. Briana Taylor was not a drug dealer. Rianna Taylor was not a criminal. But to be clear, we see criminals in white communities taken into custody with guns in their hands. We have all seen bad guys who don't look like us. Get away with murder. We saw a murderer filled with hate at a Kroger. Walked peacefully into the jail wear constantly being made to feel that we don't have the right victim. This one did that. This one did this. We believe you all were resisting arrest. We're never compliant enough or respectable enough toe access justice in this country. Well, our city is crying and the rain is appropriate. And we are saying that Bree is the last one ending Racism and Louisville in America is not the responsibility of black people. That work belongs to white people, like people who created it, sustaining and benefit from the systems of oppression, why people hold the answers and have the ability across this country to make changes. What you are seeing are people who are tired of feeling powerless. If you want peace, you must use your power toe access and guarantee justice not just for you but for all of us. We heard your critique of Colin Kaepernick as he peacefully kneeled, but we don't hear you loud enough when an officer kneels on the neck of joy floored, murdering him in broad daylight in the middle of a busy neighborhood. What would have been the story if there were no cameras? When we are accused? Justice is swift. However, when we're the victims, justice is nowhere to be found. In fact, when we are the victims, reaction is an abundance of caution. There are excuses, platitudes and calls for us to be patient and trust the process. But trust cannot be established until it is reciprocal. We cannot trust the process that was never meant for us in the over whelming majority of cases Whether we are the victim or the accused, Black people are treated differently at every phase of the process. This is not lost on us. So while life moves on for so many, we cannot forget we do not have that luxury. We deserve better from our government from our leaders. So we say to our neighbors to this community we sit in serving and and are part of you are justified in your anger. It is a righteous anger. Your pain. Your protest required no apology. At the same time, we cannot suffer more harm. We cannot inflict more pain. We cannot lose more lives. I don't want to see another family in tears. And all of those who might walk the streets with us are not for us. They're not all fighting the same fight and they do not intend to see us succeed. So sisters and brothers, you cannot participate in protest where you do not know the leaders and you do not know their intent. We cannot continue to kill ourselves in an attempt to cope with the pain of our existence. In this space, our fight must be strategic. We believe that the protests that occurred in downtown Louisville last night on Thursday, May 28th were organized plan and intended to be peaceful. Unfortunately, as the night went on, there were individuals who began to engage in behavior that jeopardized the health and safety of all of us. All of us. We do not have specifics on the shootings and we will not speculate about what transpired. While we're glad to know that all those who were injured are expected to recover, we do not believe that should be the story. Nor should damage to property be the headline. This is the time for the truth to be told. We have taken enough why people have watched us suffer enough and we can only guarantee peace when we see justice. Even the gangbanger is in search of power. Every person wants to feel as though their life matters. After all, this is and has always been about the humanity and just treatment of people. Black people. So for those who continue to march and rally, please seek out responsible organizer's who care about your safety. I am deeply concerned about the protest scheduled for tonight, and I cannot attend and I would never send you anywhere that I would not send my Children. So please hear me when I say use your best judgment. But most importantly, no, that there are many, many ways to fight. Our freedom will not be one solely in the streets but at the ballot box. In the policy hearing around the boardroom table and every other place we show up their organizations around this community that need your voice that need your energy. But you must be here, alive and healthy to participate. We made you here. We have to respect the memory of Rianna Taylor. She was a woman who was fighting to save others. We cannot put our lives at risk in seeking justice for her. We must be here to fight. We must be here to ensure that justice is served in this case. I am allied with my colleague Stephanie Hightower in Columbus when she says, I cannot and do not Kentucky condone intentional damage to persons or property. But I can affirm that the literal and figurative incidents of lynching will provoke outrage. It does not matter if injustices come packaged as overt acts or implicit assumptions.

Until that point, things had been peaceful. That is how Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac characterized the demonstration when he spoke at 10:50 p.m. outside the Policfe District One building. ""A lot of people are angry and understandably so,"" Isaac said. ""As I've said in several other statements, we share their outrage. I understand where the anger is coming from. But tonight was peaceful. I haven't seen any property damage."" Not even 30 minutes later, that changed. Friday night: Protesters break windows at justice center, OTR businesses during rally over George Floyd's death Protesters spent hours Friday night and into Saturday morning marching through downtown Cincinnati and Over-the-Rhine, eventually breaking windows, looting and lighting fires in dumpsters. Windows at the Justice Center were broken. As were windows at Saks Fifth Avenue, located several blocks away. Police said several windows of Over-the-Rhine businesses were also broken. Broken windows at MiCA 12/v on 12th and Vine streets in Over-the-Rhine, May 30, 2020. (Photo: The Enquirer/Luann Gibbs) The rally began outside of the courthouse at 6 p.m. It started with a couple of dozen protestors, with leader Jordan Telting talking on a megaphone to the group. “I can’t breathe,"" people chanted. Telting told The Enquirer that he and fellow protesters are ""just tired of it."" “We’re tired of the police being above the law. We’re tired of the police using terrorist tactics to control our communities,"" he said. To the crowd, he shouted: ""If you don’t stand for your rights, you’re going to lose those rights."" From the courthouse, the rally moved to Police District One, then around the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood past patio diners, back to the police station and on through the West End neighborhood. Protesters briefly walked onto Interstate 75, stopping traffic, still marching peacefully. For hours, Cincinnati police did not engage, allowing the protest to proceed. But by 11 p.m. officers at District One had donned riot gear. They were seen standing in a line outside the police station. Around the same time, protesters' anger grew over the death of George Floyd in the hands of Minnesota police. The crowd dispersed into various areas, most notably to the Justice Center and up into Race and Vine streets where businesses were vandalized. Sirens blared and a police helicopter hovered over Over-the-Rhine during the night. Some people were arrested; Lt. Steve Saunders, spokesman for the Cincinnati Police Department, could not give an exact number Saturday morning. ""Our primary effort right now is to stabilize this area and seek cooperation and calm from the groups engaging in violent and turbulent behavior,"" Saunders said. Protesters came to a bit of a standstill along Central Parkway, with multiple cop cars present. Some people set fires. A peaceful protest is scheduled for noon today at Washington Park in Over-the-Rhine. Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley is expected to hold a press conference later Saturday morning. More: Multiple Cincinnati protests planned over death of George Floyd It was all eerily reminiscent of 2001 when riots broke out in the exact same spots after the police shooting of Timothy Thomas, a 19-year-old unarmed black man. Protesters stopped briefly at the Over-the-Rhine location where Thomas died. In the wake of the 2001 riots, Cincinnati worked to improve police-community relations, putting together the historic Collaborative Agreement that emphasizes problem-solving policing.

1620965292,2020-05-30 10:47:58,George Floyd protest live updates: Governor 'fully mobilizing' National Guard in Minnesota,http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625596000/0/courierjournal/home~George-Floyd-protest-live-updates-Governor-fully-mobilizing-National-Guard-in-Minnesota/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS — Police used tear gas, smoke grenades and nonlethal projectiles Saturday night in a coordinated effort to beak up groups gathering after the start of the Twin Cities' curfew, aimed at preventing another night of violent protests after days of unrest following the death of George Floyd. Several hours after the 8 p.m. curfew began, there were ""no reported injuries of consequence,"" Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told the media. He acknowledged that the situation could change as the night continued. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey reported at least two dozen arrests were made Saturday night and said it was too early to say whether the curfew would be extended another night. Earlier Frey said even peaceful protests weren't welcome after the curfew. Highways were closed and officials urged all residents to stay home, saying it was necessary to separate peaceful protesters from those intending to cause further damage to a city reeling after days of fiery demonstrations. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Minnesota governor Tim Walz said. Local officials' increasingly strict stance comes after days of violence in the city, with Thursday night's unrest being the most chaotic as protesters breached a police precinct building and set it on fire. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer kept his knee pressed into his neck for more than eight minutes, sparking dozens of protests against police brutality across the country. City-by-city look:George Floyd protests continue Saturday, cities begin issuing curfews Thousands of people took to the streets nationwide and hundreds were arrested Friday and into early Saturday morning, resulting in injuries to protesters and officers. By sunrise, at least three people had died amid the protests. Demonstrations continued throughout the day Saturday in dozens of cities, and more protests were planned and curfews issued for Saturday evening. Follow USA TODAY reporters Trevor Hughes and Tyler Davis for reports from the scene. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. Here are the latest developments: Minnesota Department of Transportation announced multiple highway closures in the Twin Cities, starting at 7 p.m. Saturday. ""Routes will remain open for motorists to exit downtown areas,"" the department tweeted. Officials expected demonstrators to set fires, use deadly force and use ""civilians as shields from law enforcement,"" the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted before and after curfew began. As part of the state's increased enforcement, the Minnesota National Guard said more than 4,100 service members had been deployed to the Twin Cities and projected more than 10,000 would soon be called up. Who is causing the violence? Extremists are hijacking peaceful protests, officials say Read this: Experts say knee-to-neck restraint is dangerous, but Minneapolis allows it. Tear gas, smoke bombs and explosions near Fifth Precinct Hundreds of protesters sat to await the arrival of law enforcement as curfew approached near Fifth Precinct. One commented that police couldn't arrest the whole group. Soon, black-clad law enforcement approached to the sound of explosions. Some demonstrators chanted “Hands up, don’t shoot!” Police officers fired nonlethal projectiles toward masses of people, including a crowd of media gathered in an alley next to a looted store. Protesters reported tear gas being used. Some people hobbled away from an intersection appearing to be injured. ""State Patrol troopers are moving in to secure the Fifth Precinct. Go home and obey the curfew order now,"" Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. An empty street fills as curfew falls near Lake Street Minneapolis' Lake Street was the scene of running battles between protesters, law-enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard on Friday night. But as curfew began Saturday, it was nearly empty and eerily quiet. Smoke still wafted from some of the burned-out buildings, including the Third Precinct police substation. Earlier in the day, hundreds of volunteers swept clean the debris that once clogged the streets. Soon, the area was filled with people again as a crowd materialized. A group headed across the Mississippi River bridge on Lake Street from Minneapolis toward Saint Paul, initially with no sign of law enforcement. Moments later, police pushed back the large protest group. Under a heavy barrage of flash-bangs and smoke grenades, the group quickly retreated, chanting “We come in peace, we mean no harm.” Officials walk back claims about out-of-state arrests Walz and Carter alleged early Saturday that many of the protesters inciting violence and causing destruction were from outside the state but later acknowledged current data does not support that claim. A civil arrest list provided by the public information officer of the St. Paul Police Department shows 12 of the 18 people arrested from Thursday through 6 a.m. Saturday were from Minnesota. Five of them are from St. Paul, three are from Woodbury (part of the Twin Cities metropolitan area), two are from Minneapolis, one is from Mankato and one is from St. Louis Park. Four are from out of state and two did not have cities of residence listed. Carter said his statements were based on data he later learned was inaccurate. Walz said arrests made Saturday night will give officials a “much bigger data set” of where protestors are from. As grocery stores close in Minneapolis, volunteers offer help Volunteers on the north side of Minneapolis on Saturday afternoon turned parking lots into makeshift markets to combat a dearth of grocery stores in the area. At the intersection of West Broadway and Emerson avenues, about 250 people filled the lots at U.S. Bank and Episcopal Church in Minnesota to drop off and pick up donations from members of the community. Amanda Kelli, 18, has relatives who live on the north side and said it’s been a struggle to find food the past few days. “My family has been looking for somewhere to go grocery shopping — my mom, my dad my grandma,” she said, as she held her baby and chowed on pizza. “But we couldn’t find nothing so we came here.” All businesses along Broadway appeared to be closed as of Saturday afternoon due to violent protests the past two nights. Breyonne Golding, a community planner, called the donation effort “healing” for a low-income area usually starved of resources, but even more so now. “On the north side, there’s only three grocery stores. All of them are boarded up,” said Golding, a native of Connecticut. “It’s about to be the first of the month, where are they gonna get food?” Omar to Minneapolis residents: ‘Stay home tonight’ Rep. Ilhan Omar asked Minneapolis residents to stay home Saturday night in an effort to isolate ""agitators"" she says are destroying minority owned business during protests over the death of Floyd. Omar, D-Minn., represents the district where Floyd was killed. ""Right now, our grief and pain is being exploited. People primarily from outside our city are destroying black and minority-owned businesses in our city,” Omar said. “We can’t let them. Let us all prioritize justice for George Floyd, police reform, alongside the safety of our community and the prevention of more violence. I urge people to stay home tonight so we can better target and isolate these agitators.” – Sean Rossman Minnesota National Guard plans to deploy as many as 10,000 soldiers The Minnesota National Guard planned to deploy as many as 10,000 troops to respond to unrest in Minneapolis, a massive increase over the 850 now on duty. Meanwhile, the Pentagon offered to assist Minnesota with active-duty troops. So far, Walz has not sought help from federal troops, according to a statement from Jonathan Hoffman, a Defense Department spokesman. Walz said this morning that he had spoken with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on Saturday, as well as with mayors across the country, and was ""fully mobilizing"" the state's National Guard for the first time in Minnesota's history. Walz alleged that the protests were fueled by elements of domestic terrorism, ideological extremists and international destabilization. 'Stay home tonight,' officials and community leaders plead In an afternoon news conference, Minnesota officials asked residents to forgo protests and stay home after 8 p.m. Saturday night so that law enforcement could ""remove those folks who are harming us."" Community and faith leaders – including reverends, rabbis, imams and representatives of the state's Latino, Asian, and Native American communities, as well as the uncle of Philando Castile – encouraged residents to observe the curfew. ""We need to create the space for people to be able to grieve, to come together, to mourn the loss of George Floyd,"" Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said in an afternoon news conference. ""We cannot do that until community can gather safely ... Stay home tonight so that we can remove those folks who are harming us."" Flanagan said that some of the protesters were ""detractors,"" ""white supremacists"" and ""anarchists."" ""They are not from our state, and they're coming from the outside,"" and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. ""We cannot move forward when people are burning down our city."" Volunteers begin cleaning up Across Minneapolis, groups of volunteers spontaneously appeared to begin cleaning up the damage Saturday morning. Leaning on her shovel while talking, social worker Kara Vangen, 58, said no one should mistake the cleanup as a criticism of the protests themselves. ""I’m supporting the protesting, completely. And this is my neighborhood, so this is part of the healing,"" she said, over the scrape of shovels clearing rubble from a burned-out Walgreens. Wearing face masks, Anton Reuter and Beno Boda, both 17, picked up trash strewn in the street. The two, who live nearby, said they had heard reports that troublemakers from outside downtown Minneapolis have been flooding into the area last night causing damage. They wanted people to know that those who live here care about this neighborhood. ""It’s not going to get better waiting on the government,"" Boda said. Morning in Minneapolis: Firefighters put out blazes, clear rubble As Saturday morning dawned in Minneapolis, authorities had moved back into some formerly contested areas, and firefighters with the Minneapolis Fire Department poured water onto a still-smoldering gas station in the Hiawatha area as a small crowd watched. No police were present. Over on Lake Street at Columbus Avenue, members of the Minnesota National Guard controlled access to the streets, their Humvees and trucks blocking the road as firefighters and public works officials tried to shut off leaking gas lines and clear rubble from the road. Because some areas lost power, drivers collided yesterday when speeding through stoplights that weren’t working, and their abandoned crashed cars were then set ablaze. Broken glass from shattered windows and bus stops crunched underfoot. ""This is sad. It’s very emotional right now. I just had to come down and see it,"" said Brian Ledin, 58, who lives in a nearby suburb but was born in the area. Smoke rose from an O’Reilly Auto Parts store and CenterPoint energy workers searched for broken gas lines. Report: Military police could be dispatched to Minnesota The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to Minneapolis on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, the Associated Press reports, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. According to the AP report, soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called. Soldiers in Fort Carson in Colorado and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. Fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin arrested, booked Derek Michael Chauvin, 44, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection to Floyd's death. He was booked into the Ramsey County Jail. A criminal complaint that references body cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. Read more.",0.0

Louisville Courier Journal LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Mayor Greg Fischer is implementing a dusk-to-dawn curfew and calling in the National Guard for future protests around the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor. ""The tone clearly changed last night. The number of people on our street clearly changed last night, as well,"" Fischer said. ""This turned from being a peaceful protest into violence and terrorism and looting on the streets of our city."" Fischer said the National Guard would arrive in Louisville ""later today."" About 350 Kentucky Guardsmen will be on the scene Saturday night, the organization confirmed in a release, including soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, the 138th Field Artillery in Lexington, the 198th Military Police Battalion in Louisville, the 761st Firefighting Team out of Greenville and Air Guardsmen from the 123rd Airlift Wing in Louisville. They will be preparted to help police ""in maintaining peace and protect critical infrastructure."" More: Greg Fischer, Louisville police blame looting at protest on out-of-towners Read this: Second night of Breonna Taylor protests marked by vandalism downtown On the curfew, Fischer said if people want to protest, they can do so ""while it's light outside."" The curfew will run from 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday, the executive order said, and will be reevaluated Monday morning. It does not apply to ""individuals who are commuting to a place of work, house of worship for services or involved in any action that is medically necessary to protect a friend or family member."" Anyone who violates the curfew can be cited, according to a Q&A released by city officials, and asked to return home. ""First and foremost, I encourage people to stay home and stay safe. Peaceful protest, certainly I respect that under our Constitution. But this has gone way beyond peaceful protest,"" Fischer said. Less than an hour before Fischer's announcement, Gov. Andy Beshear announced he'd send the National Guard to Louisville in a video posted to Twitter, calling it a step to ""ensure the safety of everybody"" and ""help keep peace."" “What we have seen, especially last night, and what our intelligence says is going to happen tonight are outside groups moving in, trying to create violence to harm everybody who is on those streets. We cannot let Breonna’s legacy be marred by violence and we can’t let our streets turn violent,"" Beshear said. “I hope everybody knows that this is a big step and a tough step. It’s not one intended to silence any voice because I want to hear,"" he said, ""but I want to make sure, at the end of the day, that we are all safe.” Governor Andy Beshear's statement following last night's demonstration in Louisville: https://t.co/ndgiFwSCuD — Governor Andy Beshear (@GovAndyBeshear) May 30, 2020 Jessie Halladay, a spokeswoman for Louisville Metro Police, also added Saturday morning that the police department's tactics will ""no longer"" be about allowing peaceful protest. ""If that wants to go on, we are going to allow that. But we will be out. This is about stopping criminal behavior, at this point. This is not protest. This is now criminal behavior,"" Halladay said. ""And that was a very difficult pivot for our officers to make as that happened, because they were overwhelmed themselves."" Friday night's protests left an onslaught of property damage in their wake. Destruction from the second night of protests over the death of Taylor, an unarmed black woman killed in her home by police in March, ranged across the city's downtown. Fourth Street Live took the brunt of the evening’s looting, with businesses such as Eddie Merlot's restaurant and the Omni hotel being breached. Downtown was littered with people Saturday morning, walking their dogs, cellphones out, taking photos and surveying the damage. Many shook their heads or volunteered to help clean up the shattered storefront glass. More: Hundreds fill Louisville streets for 2nd straight night of protests over Breonna Taylor shooting T-Mobile on Fourth and Liberty streets was trashed and looted, the alarm still blaring. Shelves and racks were empty where phones and accessories were stolen. “I can’t believe they’ve destroyed our city,” one man said. Graffiti littered the facade of nearly every building. Broken window panes at the Metro Department of Corrections were a reminder of Thursday evening, the first night of protests. LMPD had blocked off downtown streets where police and crews were cleaning up. Several Fourth Street bars were also broken into and liquor was stolen, as reported Friday evening. On every block, people were sweeping the glass off of the sidewalk. Some were walking downtown, whether on their normal route or just to check out the damage from Friday night.

The clash with police came after a day of mostly peaceful protests and marches ignited by the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, an unarmed African American who died last week when an officer used a choke hold during his arrest. The unrest in Cincinnati, while not as severe as in some other cities, is the worst here in almost two decades and mirrored protests and violence across the country, from Los Angeles to New York. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine called in the National Guard to restore order in Columbus and Cleveland. “This violence must stop,” DeWine said. Mayor John Cranley imposed a 10 p.m. curfew Saturday and Sunday night, but as that deadline approached Saturday, several hundred protesters showed no sign of leaving the streets. As they scattered after the crackdown at District 1, some of the leaders chanted, ""Go to the courthouse."" Hundreds of demonstrators followed those instructions, gathering briefly at the Hamilton County Courthouse before moving on toward Vine Street, where they headed up the hill toward the University of Cincinnati, chanting, setting small fires and jumping on parked cars as they went. Police arrested at least seven people as they marched on Vine Street and more around UC's campus, where vandals broke windows at several businesses in Clifton Heights. A police officer dispersing the crowd in Clifton Heights was struck in the ballistic helmet by a bullet at 12:23 a.m Sunday at McMillan Street and Ohio Avenue, police said. The officer wasn't injured and it is not clear who fired the bullet, police said. Until night fell, most protesters had remained peaceful as organizers and city officials urged calm throughout the day and promised police would allow them to march and speak their minds. Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac said early Saturday that he was angry about Floyd’s death, too, and would do nothing to stop peaceful protests. “I understand their anger,” Isaac said. “I share that anger with them.” For the most part Saturday, that’s what happened. Hundreds of demonstrators rallied in Washington Park at noon and then marched without incident through city streets, past boarded-up stores and restaurants that had been ransacked the night before. Protest organizers said they wanted to avoid a repeat of Friday night, when violence erupted soon after marchers began to disperse around 11:30 p.m. About 55 businesses were damaged by vandals and looters Friday night and early Saturday. “We all saw everything that happened last night and we wanted to make sure this was something different, something healing,” said Keizayla Sambro, one of the protest leaders. That hope began to fade, however, as the day wore on. By late afternoon Saturday, after hours of peaceful protests, some demonstrators began throwing objects at police after two women were arrested for spitting on an officer and attempting to steal a police bike. Police in riot gear then pushed back the crowd at 12th and Race streets with pepper spray and flash bangs, leading to a tense standoff near Washington Park, with police lined up with riot shields on one side and angry protesters on the other. Cincinnati's protests Saturday began in the early afternoon in Washington Park, where about 500 people gathered to demand justice for Floyd's family and others who have died in police custody. After listening to speakers for about an hour in the park, the crowd swelled to more than 1,000 and began marching toward City Hall, past boarded-up shops and restaurants that had been ransacked overnight. Organizers urged everyone to protest peacefully. ""If you see anyone else not being peaceful, check them,"" Calisha Brooks told the crowd. ""We celebrate peace."" When the demonstrators reached City Hall, they found it surrounded by police and began chanting, ""Don't shoot, don't shoot."" There were no reports of violence or arrests. In a press conference early Saturday, Isaac said the protests Friday night began peacefully, too, as demonstrators marched through downtown, Over-the-Rhine, the West End and, briefly, onto I-75, forcing police to close the highway for about 20 minutes. Isaac said problems arose when the protesters began to disperse and other, smaller groups began breaking windows, lighting fires in dumpsters, looting stores and throwing bottles at police officers. Two officers sustained minor injuries but returned to duty, Isaac said. Police reported 11 arrests on charges that included burglary, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and breaking and entering. Though not as severe or widespread, the unrest was the most significant in Cincinnati since protests and violence erupted in 2001 after the police shooting of Timothy Thomas, an unarmed black man in Over-the-Rhine. That led to days of unrest, a federal investigation and reforms of the police department. Cranley and Isaac said the unrest is different this time, not only in severity but also in its origins. In 2001, they said, the protests focused on Cincinnati and the actions of the city's police officers, while now the anger is directed at the mistreatment of African Americans nationwide. ""The issue was about Cincinnati (in 2001). It was about us,"" Cranley said early Saturday. ""It wasn't Cincinnati police officers that killed Mr. Floyd. These issues are all over the country."" He said the lessons the city learned in 2001 showed Friday night and early Saturday morning as Cincinnati's police officers encountered those who were protesting peacefully and those who were not. Cranley said officers allowed the protesters to march peacefully and responded responsibly when they needed to make arrests. ""Our police department last night was extraordinary,"" Cranley said. ""Our police, in my opinion, based on our long, tough journey over the last 20 years, are the best at being sensitive to First Amendment rights but drawing the line at criminal behavior."" Isaac also said police would continue to allow peaceful protests until the curfew takes effect, but he warned violence would be met with force and arrests. ""Our officers are very disciplined,"" Isaac said. ""But they will defend themselves."" Business owners and city officials assessed the damage Saturday morning and said they were thankful the unrest had not been as severe as in some cities, including Minneapolis, which has endured several nights of violence and destruction. ""Obviously, things could have been a lot worse,"" said Steve Leeper, president of the Cincinnati Center City Development Corp. The owners of Cincy Shirts on Main Street said the damage to their store was severe enough to delay their planned reopening. Looters broke windows and stole merchandise late Friday. ""Guess we're not reopening this weekend after all,"" the store's owners said on Twitter. ""Sad for our city and our country. Not asking for sympathy. This is just stuff. It can be replaced. Hopefully this will be a wake up call for all of us to just be better to each other."" There was concern, however, that the risk of more trouble remains. Several businesses, including some that had not been damaged Friday, were boarding up windows Saturday in anticipation of additional looting. Floyd's death is among several high-profile cases involving African Americans in police custody nationwide and his name has become a rallying cry for civil rights activists. The city and the nation also have been enduring the coronavirus pandemic, high unemployment, a dramatic downturn in the economy and intensifying political divisions. The Floyd case, though, is the most immediate concern among those who have taken to the streets. ""We came out here for what happened in Minneapolis,"" said Jordan Telting, an organizer of the protest Friday night. ""Everywhere we're being harassed and we're sick of it."" Several city leaders, including Cranley, said they hoped the actions of those who committed crimes Friday night would not overshadow the message protesters were trying to send: That racial inequities and discrimination remain a serious problem in the United States. ""It's unfortunate for all of us that the actions of a few will distract from what is truly a major problem,"" Cranley said. Cincinnati Vice Mayor Christopher Smitherman said African Americans like him are outraged by Floyd's death because it's easy for them to imagine what happened to him happening to them. ""It's the reality that so many African Americans struggle with every day,"" he said. But Smitherman also said the kind of unrest the city experienced Friday night and early Saturday is not the answer. ""No law-abiding citizen ... would condone people breaking into businesses, throwing projectiles at our great Cincinnati police officers and creating unrest,"" he said. Deon J.

As the night went on things got violent. Cincinnati Enquirer Friday night rally organizer Jordan Telting said he hoped the night would be nonviolent at the start of the George Floyd protest, but on Saturday morning admitted he was ""surprised"" violence did not begin sooner. The first five hours of the protest were peaceful. At around 11:15 p.m., people began smashing in windows at the Hamilton County Justice Center and taking down the American flag from outside that building. Business windows were broken. Some people were arrested. Police came out with full riot gear. ""I honestly am surprised that all that did not start sooner because – and I'm not, like, trying to make excuses for anybody – but the whole time, like as soon – even before we got to the highway, but especially once we got to the highway – the whole time the police were, like, trying to antagonize us. Almost... like they wanted us to be violent,"" Telting said Saturday morning. Jordan Telting talks about his experience with police outside of Cincinnati Police headquarters Friday, May 29, 2020. A large crowd marched through downtown Cincinnati in protest of George Floyd and other black men who have been killed by police. (Photo: Cara Owsley/The Enquirer) Telting, 27, is from Winton Hills. He said he left just before any of the vandalism or looting began, to get home to his five children. He continued to watch the night's events unfold on social media and live feeds on his laptop. As people began congregating for the protest at 6 p.m., Telting said he had talked to people about safety measures. He was hopeful things would stay nonviolent. ""Obviously, we can't really control everyone's actions,"" Telting said as the rally started outside of the courthouse. ""But I'm pretty sure everyone knows that we're coming out here with good intentions, we're just spreading the word about the injustices that the police carry out regularly. It's bigger than Minnesota. It happens regularly; every city, every day."" At the tail end of what had been a peaceful walk around downtown, Telting headed toward his car to go home. “We came out here like everybody else because we’re tired of the police injustices. We’re tired of the police and their scare tactics against us. We’re out here using our First Amendment rights, the very first right granted to us by the Constitution,” he said. “We came out here for what happened in Minneapolis. There was a crime committed. Everywhere we’re being harassed and we’re sick of it.” When asked what he wanted demonstrators to take away from the event, Telting said: “We all have to stop being afraid of the police. I love you Cincinnati.” Less than one hour later, large groups of people gathered near Race and 12th streets, looting the clothing apparel store City Gear. Whether those who took from the store were protesters or onlookers hanging around downtown is unclear. Armed Cincinnati SWAT team units and dozens of police officers quickly responded to the scene and after a brief standoff, inched the crowd backward. Protestors in turn threw water bottles and glass bottles at police vehicles and cursed them. The once large crowd began separating, spilling over throughout different sections of downtown. On Saturday, Telting emphasized that these protests are occurring all over the nation, not just in Cincinnati. ""This is a pent-up aggression felt all over the country by everyone,"" Telting said. More protests are scheduled throughout the weekend. Telting says he is headed to a Dayton protest today and will be back out in Cincinnati throughout the weekend.

Mayor Greg Fischer is confident he has the answer. Louisville Metro Police officials believe ""a significant percentage of the protesters came from outside of our city,"" an angered Fischer said after 1 a.m. Saturday morning in a teleconference addressing the chaos of the night. They were the ones, he said, who broke windows and took part in looting, which had not been an issue at the protest a night earlier. ""They seem to be people that do this type of activity regularly, unfortunately, around the country,"" Fischer said. Friday recap: Hundreds fill Louisville streets for 2nd straight night of protests Read more: What to know about investigations into the shooting of Breonna Taylor The mayor had plenty of praise for Louisville police officers, thanking them repeatedly for showing restraint throughout the night (only two arrests were reported, though officers fired tear gas into crowds several times and one officer was seen intentionally firing a weapon at a WAVE3 TV crew). And he thanked those protesters who were peaceful during the hourslong demonstration, which took place to call for justice following the shooting of Breonna Taylor by Louisville police. But local law enforcement officials had several clues that protesters from out of town came to Louisville on Friday with the intent of causing damage, Fischer said. Buy Photo Windows were broken out at Subway on 6th Street on Friday, May 29, 2020. (Photo: Michael Clevenger/Courier Journal) A lot of protesters, he said, were asking officers for directions around town, and LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said earlier in the evening that she was sure the larger crowd at Friday's protest was due to demonstrators from outside the city. Louisville police had been tracking social media posts, she said, and learned of buses coming from Indianapolis for the protests. Officers had also seen a notable number of cars with license plates from outside Kentucky. “It’s been a high-profile conversation, and obviously we use a lot of intelligence about what’s occurring,” Halladay said. “With an active social media platform we can see a lot of people traveled here for this tonight.” Only two arrests took place Friday night, police said, but Halladay said department officials would make an effort to figure out who was behind some of the vandalism and looting — the Omni Louisville Hotel, Kentucky International Convention Center and several other downtown businesses were hit hard. ""This is a really difficult, fluid situation to manage, especially when you know you have people who are not local who are coming in with the sole purpose of agitating and creating disturbance and division, frankly, between the residents of this community and the police who've worked so hard to protect those residents,"" Halladay said. ""We're doing what we can monitoring intelligence channels, watching social media, and we hope to be able to identify some of these folks so that we can bring them to justice for the destruction they've caused here. ""There are a lot of non-Louisvillians here,"" she concluded, ""causing significant damage to our city."" Kentucky coronavirus map: How many cases are in Kentucky? Where are they? Fischer urged those who live in the city to stay home this weekend to help officers get control of the situation. He noted that city officials would ""assess every option"" ahead of Saturday evening and could call in other law enforcement agencies, including the National Guard, to help keep the peace at Saturday's demonstrations as the city continues to address the grievances that arose from Taylor's killing. ""Once the out-of-town people leave, we still have to rebuild our city,"" he said. ""And I don't know anybody is from our great city that wants to destroy it.""

1620992770,2020-05-30 11:13:48,George Floyd protest live updates: Governor 'fully mobilizing' National Guard in Minnesota,http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/625596000/0/cincinnati-home~George-Floyd-protest-live-updates-Governor-fully-mobilizing-National-Guard-in-Minnesota/,en,False,,82890,nky.cincinnati.com,http://nky.cincinnati.com/#spider,"MINNEAPOLIS — Police used tear gas, smoke grenades and nonlethal projectiles Saturday night in a coordinated effort to beak up groups gathering after the start of the Twin Cities' curfew, aimed at preventing another night of violent protests after days of unrest following the death of George Floyd. Several hours after the 8 p.m. curfew began, there were ""no reported injuries of consequence,"" Minnesota Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell told the media. He acknowledged that the situation could change as the night continued. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey reported at least two dozen arrests were made Saturday night and said it was too early to say whether the curfew would be extended another night. Earlier Frey said even peaceful protests weren't welcome after the curfew. Highways were closed and officials urged all residents to stay home, saying it was necessary to separate peaceful protesters from those intending to cause further damage to a city reeling after days of fiery demonstrations. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Minnesota governor Tim Walz said. Local officials' increasingly strict stance comes after days of violence in the city, with Thursday night's unrest being the most chaotic as protesters breached a police precinct building and set it on fire. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer kept his knee pressed into his neck for more than eight minutes, sparking dozens of protests against police brutality across the country. City-by-city look:George Floyd protests continue Saturday, cities begin issuing curfews Thousands of people took to the streets nationwide and hundreds were arrested Friday and into early Saturday morning, resulting in injuries to protesters and officers. By sunrise, at least three people had died amid the protests. Demonstrations continued throughout the day Saturday in dozens of cities, and more protests were planned and curfews issued for Saturday evening. Follow USA TODAY reporters Trevor Hughes and Tyler Davis for reports from the scene. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. Here are the latest developments: Minnesota Department of Transportation announced multiple highway closures in the Twin Cities, starting at 7 p.m. Saturday. ""Routes will remain open for motorists to exit downtown areas,"" the department tweeted. Officials expected demonstrators to set fires, use deadly force and use ""civilians as shields from law enforcement,"" the Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted before and after curfew began. As part of the state's increased enforcement, the Minnesota National Guard said more than 4,100 service members had been deployed to the Twin Cities and projected more than 10,000 would soon be called up. Who is causing the violence? Extremists are hijacking peaceful protests, officials say Read this: Experts say knee-to-neck restraint is dangerous, but Minneapolis allows it. Tear gas, smoke bombs and explosions near Fifth Precinct Hundreds of protesters sat to await the arrival of law enforcement as curfew approached near Fifth Precinct. One commented that police couldn't arrest the whole group. Soon, black-clad law enforcement approached to the sound of explosions. Some demonstrators chanted “Hands up, don’t shoot!” Police officers fired nonlethal projectiles toward masses of people, including a crowd of media gathered in an alley next to a looted store. Protesters reported tear gas being used. Some people hobbled away from an intersection appearing to be injured. ""State Patrol troopers are moving in to secure the Fifth Precinct. Go home and obey the curfew order now,"" Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. An empty street fills as curfew falls near Lake Street Minneapolis' Lake Street was the scene of running battles between protesters, law-enforcement and the Minnesota National Guard on Friday night. But as curfew began Saturday, it was nearly empty and eerily quiet. Smoke still wafted from some of the burned-out buildings, including the Third Precinct police substation. Earlier in the day, hundreds of volunteers swept clean the debris that once clogged the streets. Soon, the area was filled with people again as a crowd materialized. A group headed across the Mississippi River bridge on Lake Street from Minneapolis toward Saint Paul, initially with no sign of law enforcement. Moments later, police pushed back the large protest group. Under a heavy barrage of flash-bangs and smoke grenades, the group quickly retreated, chanting “We come in peace, we mean no harm.” Officials walk back claims about out-of-state arrests Walz and Carter alleged early Saturday that many of the protesters inciting violence and causing destruction were from outside the state but later acknowledged current data does not support that claim. A civil arrest list provided by the public information officer of the St. Paul Police Department shows 12 of the 18 people arrested from Thursday through 6 a.m. Saturday were from Minnesota. Five of them are from St. Paul, three are from Woodbury (part of the Twin Cities metropolitan area), two are from Minneapolis, one is from Mankato and one is from St. Louis Park. Four are from out of state and two did not have cities of residence listed. Carter said his statements were based on data he later learned was inaccurate. Walz said arrests made Saturday night will give officials a “much bigger data set” of where protestors are from. As grocery stores close in Minneapolis, volunteers offer help Volunteers on the north side of Minneapolis on Saturday afternoon turned parking lots into makeshift markets to combat a dearth of grocery stores in the area. At the intersection of West Broadway and Emerson avenues, about 250 people filled the lots at U.S. Bank and Episcopal Church in Minnesota to drop off and pick up donations from members of the community. Amanda Kelli, 18, has relatives who live on the north side and said it’s been a struggle to find food the past few days. “My family has been looking for somewhere to go grocery shopping — my mom, my dad my grandma,” she said, as she held her baby and chowed on pizza. “But we couldn’t find nothing so we came here.” All businesses along Broadway appeared to be closed as of Saturday afternoon due to violent protests the past two nights. Breyonne Golding, a community planner, called the donation effort “healing” for a low-income area usually starved of resources, but even more so now. “On the north side, there’s only three grocery stores. All of them are boarded up,” said Golding, a native of Connecticut. “It’s about to be the first of the month, where are they gonna get food?” Omar to Minneapolis residents: ‘Stay home tonight’ Rep. Ilhan Omar asked Minneapolis residents to stay home Saturday night in an effort to isolate ""agitators"" she says are destroying minority owned business during protests over the death of Floyd. Omar, D-Minn., represents the district where Floyd was killed. ""Right now, our grief and pain is being exploited. People primarily from outside our city are destroying black and minority-owned businesses in our city,” Omar said. “We can’t let them. Let us all prioritize justice for George Floyd, police reform, alongside the safety of our community and the prevention of more violence. I urge people to stay home tonight so we can better target and isolate these agitators.” – Sean Rossman Minnesota National Guard plans to deploy as many as 10,000 soldiers The Minnesota National Guard planned to deploy as many as 10,000 troops to respond to unrest in Minneapolis, a massive increase over the 850 now on duty. Meanwhile, the Pentagon offered to assist Minnesota with active-duty troops. So far, Walz has not sought help from federal troops, according to a statement from Jonathan Hoffman, a Defense Department spokesman. Walz said this morning that he had spoken with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on Saturday, as well as with mayors across the country, and was ""fully mobilizing"" the state's National Guard for the first time in Minnesota's history. Walz alleged that the protests were fueled by elements of domestic terrorism, ideological extremists and international destabilization. 'Stay home tonight,' officials and community leaders plead In an afternoon news conference, Minnesota officials asked residents to forgo protests and stay home after 8 p.m. Saturday night so that law enforcement could ""remove those folks who are harming us."" Community and faith leaders – including reverends, rabbis, imams and representatives of the state's Latino, Asian, and Native American communities, as well as the uncle of Philando Castile – encouraged residents to observe the curfew. ""We need to create the space for people to be able to grieve, to come together, to mourn the loss of George Floyd,"" Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said in an afternoon news conference. ""We cannot do that until community can gather safely ... Stay home tonight so that we can remove those folks who are harming us."" Flanagan said that some of the protesters were ""detractors,"" ""white supremacists"" and ""anarchists."" ""They are not from our state, and they're coming from the outside,"" and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. ""We cannot move forward when people are burning down our city."" Volunteers begin cleaning up Across Minneapolis, groups of volunteers spontaneously appeared to begin cleaning up the damage Saturday morning. Leaning on her shovel while talking, social worker Kara Vangen, 58, said no one should mistake the cleanup as a criticism of the protests themselves. ""I’m supporting the protesting, completely. And this is my neighborhood, so this is part of the healing,"" she said, over the scrape of shovels clearing rubble from a burned-out Walgreens. Wearing face masks, Anton Reuter and Beno Boda, both 17, picked up trash strewn in the street. The two, who live nearby, said they had heard reports that troublemakers from outside downtown Minneapolis have been flooding into the area last night causing damage. They wanted people to know that those who live here care about this neighborhood. ""It’s not going to get better waiting on the government,"" Boda said. Morning in Minneapolis: Firefighters put out blazes, clear rubble As Saturday morning dawned in Minneapolis, authorities had moved back into some formerly contested areas, and firefighters with the Minneapolis Fire Department poured water onto a still-smoldering gas station in the Hiawatha area as a small crowd watched. No police were present. Over on Lake Street at Columbus Avenue, members of the Minnesota National Guard controlled access to the streets, their Humvees and trucks blocking the road as firefighters and public works officials tried to shut off leaking gas lines and clear rubble from the road. Because some areas lost power, drivers collided yesterday when speeding through stoplights that weren’t working, and their abandoned crashed cars were then set ablaze. Broken glass from shattered windows and bus stops crunched underfoot. ""This is sad. It’s very emotional right now. I just had to come down and see it,"" said Brian Ledin, 58, who lives in a nearby suburb but was born in the area. Smoke rose from an O’Reilly Auto Parts store and CenterPoint energy workers searched for broken gas lines. Report: Military police could be dispatched to Minnesota The Pentagon on Saturday ordered the Army to put military police units on alert to head to Minneapolis on short notice at President Donald Trump’s request, the Associated Press reports, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders who did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. According to the AP report, soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called. Soldiers in Fort Carson in Colorado and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. Fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin arrested, booked Derek Michael Chauvin, 44, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection to Floyd's death. He was booked into the Ramsey County Jail. A criminal complaint that references body cameras worn by the four now-former officers involved in the incident sheds additional light on what happened on Memorial Day in the moments before and after Floyd's death. The Hennepin County Attorney's complaint said Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, including two minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd was non-responsive. Read more.",0.0

Louisville Courier Journal LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Mayor Greg Fischer is implementing a dusk-to-dawn curfew and calling in the National Guard for future protests around the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor. ""The tone clearly changed last night. The number of people on our street clearly changed last night, as well,"" Fischer said. ""This turned from being a peaceful protest into violence and terrorism and looting on the streets of our city."" Fischer said the National Guard would arrive in Louisville ""later today."" About 350 Kentucky Guardsmen will be on the scene Saturday night, the organization confirmed in a release, including soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, the 138th Field Artillery in Lexington, the 198th Military Police Battalion in Louisville, the 761st Firefighting Team out of Greenville and Air Guardsmen from the 123rd Airlift Wing in Louisville.

The curfew will run from 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday, the executive order said, and will be reevaluated Monday morning. It does not apply to ""individuals who are commuting to a place of work, house of worship for services or involved in any action that is medically necessary to protect a friend or family member."" Anyone who violates the curfew can be cited, according to a Q&A released by city officials, and asked to return home. ""First and foremost, I encourage people to stay home and stay safe. Peaceful protest, certainly I respect that under our Constitution. But this has gone way beyond peaceful protest,"" Fischer said. Less than an hour before Fischer's announcement, Gov. Andy Beshear announced he'd send the National Guard to Louisville in a video posted to Twitter, calling it a step to ""ensure the safety of everybody"" and ""help keep peace."" “What we have seen, especially last night, and what our intelligence says is going to happen tonight are outside groups moving in, trying to create violence to harm everybody who is on those streets. We cannot let Breonna’s legacy be marred by violence and we can’t let our streets turn violent,"" Beshear said. “I hope everybody knows that this is a big step and a tough step. It’s not one intended to silence any voice because I want to hear,"" he said, ""but I want to make sure, at the end of the day, that we are all safe.” Governor Andy Beshear's statement following last night's demonstration in Louisville: https://t.co/ndgiFwSCuD — Governor Andy Beshear (@GovAndyBeshear) May 30, 2020 Jessie Halladay, a spokeswoman for Louisville Metro Police, also added Saturday morning that the police department's tactics will ""no longer"" be about allowing peaceful protest. ""If that wants to go on, we are going to allow that. But we will be out. This is about stopping criminal behavior, at this point. This is not protest. This is now criminal behavior,"" Halladay said. ""And that was a very difficult pivot for our officers to make as that happened, because they were overwhelmed themselves."" Friday night's protests left an onslaught of property damage in their wake. Destruction from the second night of protests over the death of Taylor, an unarmed black woman killed in her home by police in March, ranged across the city's downtown. Fourth Street Live took the brunt of the evening’s looting, with businesses such as Eddie Merlot's restaurant and the Omni hotel being breached. Downtown was littered with people Saturday morning, walking their dogs, cellphones out, taking photos and surveying the damage. Many shook their heads or volunteered to help clean up the shattered storefront glass. More: Hundreds fill Louisville streets for 2nd straight night of protests over Breonna Taylor shooting T-Mobile on Fourth and Liberty streets was trashed and looted, the alarm still blaring. Shelves and racks were empty where phones and accessories were stolen. “I can’t believe they’ve destroyed our city,” one man said. Graffiti littered the facade of nearly every building. Broken window panes at the Metro Department of Corrections were a reminder of Thursday evening, the first night of protests. LMPD had blocked off downtown streets where police and crews were cleaning up. Several Fourth Street bars were also broken into and liquor was stolen, as reported Friday evening. On every block, people were sweeping the glass off of the sidewalk. Some were walking downtown, whether on their normal route or just to check out the damage from Friday night.

ATLANTA — Demonstrators marched, stopped traffic and in some cases lashed out violently at police as protests erupted Friday in dozens of U.S. cities following the killing of George Floyd after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota. In Minneapolis, police say officers were being fired upon as the Pentagon prepared to possibly send troops there. Some of the worst violence was in Atlanta, where protests that began Friday afternoon stretched into the early morning hours of Saturday. After hours of peaceful protest in downtown Atlanta, some demonstrators suddenly turned violent, smashing police cars, setting one on fire, spray-painting the iconic logo sign at CNN headquarters, and breaking into a restaurant. The crowd pelted officers with bottles, chanting “Quit your jobs.” At least three officers were hurt and there were multiple arrests, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said in an emailed statement. Campos said protesters shot BB guns at officers and threw bricks, bottles and knives at them. People watched the scene from rooftops, some laughing as skirmishes broke out. Demonstrators ignored police demands to disperse. Some protesters moved to the city’s major interstate thoroughfare to try to block traffic. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms passionately addressed the protesters at a news conference: “This is not a protest. This is not in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.” “You are disgracing our city,” she told protesters. “You are disgracing the life of George Floyd and every other person who has been killed in this country. We are better than this. We are better than this as a city. We are better than this as a country. Go home, go home.” Bottoms was flanked by rappers T.I. and Killer Mike, as well as King’s daughter, Bernice King. Killer Mike cried as he spoke. “We have to be better than this moment. We have to be better than burning down our own homes. Because if we lose Atlanta what have we got?” he said. After Mayor Bottoms appealed for calm, the violence continued. More cars were set on fire, a Starbucks was smashed up, the windows of the College Football Hall of Fame were broken, and the iconic Omni Hotel was vandalized. Minneapolis In Minneapolis, where a police precinct was burned the night before, peaceful protests picked up steam as darkness fell, with thousands of people ignoring an 8 p.m. curfew to walk streets in the southern part of the city. The Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS) reported shots were being fired at law enforcement officers near the 5th Precinct early Saturday morning. In a social media post, DPS said no troopers or officers were injured and warned people to leave the area of the 5th Precinct or face arrest. Some cars were set on fire in scattered neighborhoods, business break-ins began and eventually there were larger fires. As a pair of restaurants and a Wells Fargo branch were set ablaze, a heavy contingent of National Guard, state troopers and police moved in, some on foot and some in vehicles. Soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy to Minneapolis within four hours if called, three people with direct knowledge of the orders told the Associated Press. Soldiers in Fort Carson, in Colorado, and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. The people did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations. White House lockdown The White House was forced into lockdown after about 200 protesters arrived outside the gates.' Chants of ""no justice, no peace,"" ""your silence is violence,"" and ""black lives matter,"" were heard in Lafayette Square as the crowd gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue. The protest remained mostly peaceful, though a Secret Service agent tackled a protester to the ground as the crowds moved towards the White House. A large crowd surrounded them as police responded to the scene. The White House was placed under lockdown for a little over an hour. New York City An initially peaceful demonstration in New York City over the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by police in Minnesota, spiraled into chaos as night fell Friday, as protesters skirmished with police officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires. In Brooklyn, activists who had marched from Manhattan chanted insults at officers lined up outside the Barclays Center and pelted them with water bottles. Police sprayed an eye-irritating chemical into the diverse crowd multiple times, then cleared the plaza. Video posted to social media showed officers using batons and shoving protesters as they took people into custody and cleared streets. One video showed on officer slam a woman to the ground as he walked past her in the street. Later in the evening, what had been a tense situation turned worse. Demonstrators rocked a police van, set it ablaze, then scrawled graffiti across its charred hulk and set it on fire a second time as officers retreated from the area. Blocks away, protesters used a club to batter a police cruiser. At another location near the arena, a shouting mob of protesters, some wearing helmets and carrying makeshift shields, advanced on officers shouting and throwing objects, and police retaliated with batons and arrests, leaving the roadway strewn with debris. Numerous people were arrested and police brought in buses to take them away. Houston Organizers believe more than 3,000 people gathered with Black Lives Matter Houston to protest Floyd's death with chants of “I can’t breathe” and “No justice, no peace,” as they marched from Discovery Green to City Hall. Some were arrested for attempting to block roads, including Interstate 68, but no injuries were reported, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said. The mayor added some police vehicles were damaged. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo had said he welcomed the peaceful afternoon rally, before the protests escalated into disorder. “We stand with them protesting what happened in Minnesota,” he said. “I’m happy that they’re here today because people need to be heard, voices need to be heard.” One of those protesting Floyd’s death was Jimmy Ohaz, 19, who came from Richmond, a Houston suburb. “My question is: How many more, how many more? I just want to live in a future where we all live in harmony and we’re not oppressed,"" he said. Dallas A similar escalation developed in Dallas, where a rally before hundreds of demonstrators at police headquarters escalated when demonstrators marched downtown to an intersection near City Hall. Video from the scene showed them being met by officers in riot gear and shields. After a brief melee, a police patrol car was spray-painted and a demonstrator leapt onto another one. First, a few rocks flew toward police, followed by bottles. An officer on a loudspeaker warned the throng to disperse or be arrested, then the tear gas flew. The demonstrators then turned their attention to Interstate 35E on the western edge of downtown, where dozens briefly blocked traffic. One police officer received a non-life-threatening injury during the melee and police vehicles had windows and windshields shattered and tires slashed, Police Chief U. Reneé Lee said. There were no immediate reports of arrests. Protests have spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. On Friday, the white Minneapolis police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with murder. Hundreds of chanting, placard-brandishing protesters marched through the streets of downtown Fort Worth on Friday afternoon, escorted by police. Denver After mostly peaceful protests Friday afternoon, there were clashes between protesters and police into the night. Some protesters were seen lobbing water bottles and other objects at officers and had tear gas, flashbangs and other chemicals tossed back at them. ""It's not enough to just say something on Facebook, you need to go out and you need to say something to their face, otherwise no one's gonna care and it's not gonna change,"" said protester TJ Smith from Lakewood. One of the lead protesters told the crowd over a megaphone to behave peacefully, and that doing otherwise would take away from their message. Seattle Protests in Seattle turned destructive Friday evening after a rally that started peacefully in Seattle's International District. Demonstrators broke glass at several properties downtown during Friday night's march. Flash bangs, pepper spray, and smoke bombs were deployed during the protest, with some minor injuries reported. The protest started as a peaceful rally at Hing Hay park in Seattle's International District, before part of the group broke off and started marching through downtown. Seattle officers formed a line to prevent the group from entering Interstate 5. Silicon Valley An officer was injured after hundreds of people marched through the capital of Silicon Valley and temporarily shut down a five-lane section of highway Friday. Vehicles were at a virtual standstill on the southbound lanes of U.S. 101 in San Jose ahead of rush hour during a pandemic that has kept many Californians home, according to video footage from KGO-TV. Protesters left the highway after an hour. Police later fired tear gas and nonlethal projectiles into the crowd that grew to about 1,000 protesters in downtown San Jose. Officers in riot gear lined up to prevent them from further disrupting traffic near city hall, KPIX-TV reported. A San Jose officer was taken to the hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, said Officer Gina Tepoorten, a department spokeswoman. Police officers' union spokesman Dustin DeRollo said the officer was punched in the head by protesters and knocked unconscious, while other media reports said the officer was struck by a thrown object. Several hundred protesters meanwhile marched peacefully down city streets in the state capital of Sacramento, gathering near a police station and shouting at dozens of police guarding the building. Many protesters wore masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, KCRA-TV reported. Charlotte Protests in Charlotte Friday night turned violent. Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department deemed the gathering ""unlawful"" after 9 p.m. and had ordered the demonstrators to disperse. Additional officers were brought in after the crowds ignored the order. Several people were arrested for ""property damage,"" CMPD said. Las Vegas More than 400 people were demonstrating on the Las Vegas Strip Friday afternoon calling for policing reforms. The crowd gathered in triple-digit-heat in front of the dormant fountains of the Bellagio casino-resort, holding signs and chanting “No justice, no peace!” and “Black lives matter,"" as passing cars honked. They then began walking north up the Las Vegas Strip in front of casinos still shuttered because of coronavirus-related closures. The group rallied in front of a shopping mall and briefly blocked traffic on north end of the Las Vegas Strip before marching south again, where they spilled into the streets and blocked traffic. At least two people were detained by police, though it was not clear why. Several officers used batons to push back a few protesters during the arrests. Des Moines Peaceful protests escalated as protesters met a police line outside the Des Moines, Iowa, police station Friday evening. A peaceful rally was held earlier in the evening Friday before the situation got out of hand. As the rally ended and protesters began to smash Des Moines police cars and advance towards the Des Moines police station, they were met by a police-line with riot shields.",0.0

Thursday’s protests over the police shooting death of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor had turned violent, with seven people shot from within the crowd. There were no reported incidents of gun violence Friday. But by every other measure, things escalated quickly and stayed that way long into the night. Initially, protesters marched in a loop around the blocks surrounding the court house and city hall. Some people played music. Many said they were hopeful there would be no violence or vandalism. “That’s what we’re out here for, peaceful protests,” said Simmons College of Kentucky student William Pennybaker. “We want justice for Breonna Taylor. We don’t want to tear up the city or anything like that. We just want justice for Breonna Taylor.” But that peaceful atmosphere quickly devolved. Protesters shattered windows at the courthouse and threw red paint all over the steps. A group of people pulled down the American and Louisville flags, spray painted them and lit them on fire. Meanwhile, police in riot gear formed a wall at the intersection of 5th and Jefferson, facing off with protesters. When they attempted to get an armored vehicle down the street, protesters lay in front of it. It wasn’t long before the police fired the first round of tear gas, causing protesters to scatter, eyes streaming. From that first flare of tear gas, the protest splintered into several groups and never quite found its way back to full strength. The largest group of protesters moved their march to Bardstown Road. That group was, by some estimates, 400 people strong and seemed to move fairly peacefully through the Highlands neighborhood up to Eastern Parkway before they turned around. Meanwhile, downtown, the remaining protesters engaged in skirmish after skirmish with the police. They’d face up to the police, chanting “No Justice, No Peace, Prosecute The Police” before being dispersed by tear gas. After a lap around the block and some milk for the eyes, they’d confront a different group of officers, who’d respond with flash-bangs and pepper balls. This went on for hours, and was marked by serious vandalism. Protesters lit trash can fires, broke windows and spray painted buildings. On many blocks, more storefronts were smashed out than were left untouched. All the while, LMPD kept a large portion of manpower stretched across Jefferson St. At one point, it looked like well over 50 officers were holding the line against roughly 20 young adults protesting peacefully. Meanwhile, at 4th Street Live, people looted the T-Mobile store, among others, smashed windows and lit bushes on fire. One woman stood outside Gordon Biersch with a baseball bat, hoping to protect the business from further destruction. “it is very difficult when the crowd has dispersed into these separate groups to try to keep a handle on that,” said LMPD spokesperson Jessie Halladay. “We also know that there are challenges to creating conflict between officers and individuals, so we are trying to stay hands off as we can.” Mayor Greg Fischer condemned the vandalism in an update a little after 1 a.m. “There is no excuse for the destruction of property we’ve seen this evening,” he said. “This is not protest. It is violence.” David McGuire drove downtown to check on his art gallery, Craft Gallery and Mercantile, and found one of his glass windows completely shattered. He was worried about how to protect the expensive art inside, and frustrated about the lack of police presence on 4th Street. “I have, like, a ball bat inside,” he said. “What am I supposed to do? I’m just a small business owner. Why is busting my door in helping the situation?” Breonna Taylor’s sister Juniyah Palmer condemned the vandalism and looting, which went on into the early morning hours. “What you guys started at the beginning was fine and correctly done,” she wrote. “But once y’all started vandalism, you took my sister’s name out of place.”",0.0
1621032331,2020-05-30 09:44:57,Gov. Calls In National Guard; Dusk To Dawn Curfew In Louisville,https://wfpl.org/louisville-volunteers-clean-up-downtown-after-friday-night-protests/,en,False,,93009,wfpl.org,http://wfpl.org/#spider,"Dozens of windows were smashed in downtown Louisville in the aftermath of a second night of protests calling for justice for Breonna Taylor. Six people were arrested and six police officers were injured, according to police. On Saturday morning, volunteers spontaneously arrived in downtown to clean up the city. With glass from broken windows still littering sidewalks and streets, Mayor Fischer announced a dusk to dawn curfew in Louisville beginning Saturday. The curfew runs from 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. for the next two nights. Facing the prospect of more protests on Saturday, both the day and evening, Gov. Andy Beshear called in the Kentucky National Guard to try to keep the peace. In a video statement released Saturday morning, Beshear says the hope is they’ll help keep peace in the city. “I hope everybody knows that this is a big step and a tough step and it’s not one intended to silence any voice…but I want to make sure at the end of the day we are all safe,” he said. Broken glass, paint cans and empty bottles littered Louisville streets Saturday morning. But volunteers were already out cleaning up as the sun rose over downtown. Denzel Carter and his partner Kanisha Roberts came out with brooms this morning to help sweep up the glass and talk about the previous night’s protests. Roberts said that as a Black woman, she understands the cause, but she does not support the destruction of property of small business owners. “It’s just sad so this is kind of the best thing I could do being peaceful, trying to promote that we are still a community, we want peace but we want justice,” Roberts said. Protesters scrawled anti-police graffiti with slogans including “the only good cop is a dead one,” as well as calls for justice, “I can’t breathe” and “Breonna Taylor.” A wheat-pasted flyer on a pole on Second Street reads “Death to Amerikka.” Over at the Louisville Tourism Bureau beside the convention center, a pair of volunteers swept up glass as an alarm rang out. Volunteer Daniel Harris said he works in the tourism industry and came out to help. He said protesters stole the Colonel Sanders figure from inside the bureau. “I feel everybody has a right to protest. It’s a tragedy what happened to [Taylor] and her family. What happened to her was wrong but there is no excuse for what happened last night,” Harris said.",0.0

Some restaurants and shops were broken into, and roughly 55 businesses reported damages. Cincinnati city council members expressed their reactions Saturday on Twitter and to The Enquirer: Vice Mayor Christopher Smitherman ""So I want to start off by saying that the majority — I don't want to use too broad of a brush — but majority including myself, identify with what happened to George Floyd. I'm an African American man. And so I've got five children and four of them are boys. We can all see ourselves, no matter our educational levels, economic levels, we can all see ourselves in that position. It's the reality that so many African Americans struggle with everyday. But they're really not just talking about George Floyd, and if that message is lost on on what we're talking about, these are missed opportunities in the middle of a crisis. The bigger, wider conversation is housing, transportation, criminal justice reform, would be examples of it. What our courtrooms look like today, in America? What do those high level executives in your corporations? What do they look like today? It's not just about George Floyd. He is a symbol of a shared experience that so many African American men have and their mothers."" As parents, we have a responsibility to know where our children are at ALL times. In the middle of any crisis, we still must exercise personal responsibility.  Small businesses in downtown Cincinnati did not deserve to be looted and vandalized.  Two wrongs do not make a right! — Christopher Smitherman (@voteSmitherman) May 30, 2020 ""Things were peaceful. As we got to district one, people kind of started to disband, people started to run. And they're running off to the casino area where they're engaging our police officers with projectiles. They're breaking into businesses like Black Coffee, an African American business and breaking their windows ... I don't condone any of it. And it has no place in a protest. I happen to be a member of Alpha Phi Alpha. It is a historically African American fraternity. Dr. King was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha. My fraternity brother would not agree with what occurred last night. And no law abiding citizen, which the super majority of us are, would condone people breaking into businesses, throwing projectiles at our great Cincinnati police officers and creating civil unrest, which is not the way to go on for our city ... I want to say we will be prepared tonight."" Jan-Michele Lemon Kearney ""Everybody is mourning the death of Mr. George Floyd. I think what we're seeing in the protests, you know, the hurt and the anger, partly from his death and from so many others beforehand. In Cincinnati, one thing that I really have to give a shout out to is the restraint that the police officers used because last night no one got hurt. I mean, no one got hurt. There were a few arrests. Not even that many. And so I think that says a lot about the improvement and the police community relationship that we have here and Cincinnati. ""The second message is, we can't just say everything is fine. You know, Dr. King said that riots are the method of the unheard. And it's true that we have to make sure we're listening as to how are people feeling. What can we do differently? Are there things we can do better? ""I always say we want to make sure people are safe. That's the most important thing –people before property. People need to be safe. So we do have to say, folks have to stop with the property damage, because these are people's businesses. It's how they feed their families, and they just reopened."" Chris Seelbach If us as white people start acknowledging the fact that some police officers do not treat people who look like themselves the same as they treat black men, we wouldn’t have to worry about rioting. — Chris Seelbach (@ChrisSeelbach) May 30, 2020 ""If more people would talk about it – especially for white people like me – if we talked about the problem, which is that unarmed black men continue to be killed by mostly white police officers and that's a major problem, then we wouldn't see riots. ""As I walked outside of my condo this morning, I saw all of the storefronts on Main Street boarded up with plywood. The times we live in are just as surreal as surreal can get, but we have to do as a city whatever it takes to protect people and make sure that people are safe. And then second of all, (we have to make sure) that these small businesses, that have literally been hit with the biggest shock they would've never have predicted, aren't looted. The No. 1 thing we have to do is protect our residents. So, that's what we're doing."" Jeff Pastor I am downtown watching the entire event unfold. I’m in disbelief. This is wrong. — Jeff Pastor (@votePASTOR) May 30, 2020 “It’s unproductive. I understand that people are angry because of events that occurred in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I’m also aware there are people who are tired of the same sort of a narrative of a white cop killing a black person. No matter how angry you are though, displacing your anger on Cincinnati police and business owners is not going to do anything to change what happened in Minnesota.” Excuse my candor but the shit happening down here to police officers that have nothing to do with #GeorgeFloydMurder is so wrong and disappointing. Go home! — Jeff Pastor (@votePASTOR) May 30, 2020 Betsy Sundermann ""We hear you and we are also outraged by George Floyd’s death. Cincinnati created the Collaborative Agreement almost 20 years ago to make racial equality a priority to our officers. We need to be sure to review the Collaborative Agreement periodically as the world changes. I fully support the Cincinnati Police and the work our community has done with them."" Many businesses in OTR are boarding up windows, just in case. The owner of Kismet said the glass in his windows is 100+ years old and he can’t risk losing it. I talked with a few owners about their ongoing financial hardships dealing with Covid and now property damage. pic.twitter.com/vQkYqyjC59 — Betsy Sundermann (@betsysundermann) May 30, 2020 David Mann ""Very impressed with peacefulness of so many and professionalism of our police. People and property must be protected. We have a lot to do to address continuing disparities."" George Floyd's death was unacceptable, and we are all angry and hurt. I support all protesters' rights to express that anger, and I urge everyone demonstrating to stay safe & peaceful. — Councilmember David Mann (@dsmann115) May 30, 2020 Greg Landsman “George Floyd was murdered, and getting justice - and real change - is where the focus should be. I can’t fully understand the everyday struggle that black men, women, and children face, or just how angry, traumatized and exhausted I know they are. But I can be an ally. The protests are a response to a deep desire for change. They keep the focus on George Floyd, and the fight for justice. And being outraged about George Floyd and being saddened by the destroying of property and loitering are not mutually exclusive. In fact, the latter could take away focus from George Floyd and we can’t let that happen.” Stop by Black Coffee today, open until 5PM. They got hit last night, but this team is resilient.  Coffee is on me for next hour or so, so be sure to leave a big tip and consider buying a t-shirt.

1621067474,2020-05-30 06:35:11,Kentucky has 283 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases Friday; nine new deaths,https://www.lanereport.com/126443/2020/05/kentucky-has-283-newly-confirmed-covid-19-cases-friday-nine-new-deaths/,en,False,,138099,lanereport.com,http://lanereport.com/,"FRANKFORT, Ky. — Gov. Andy Beshear on Friday updated Kentuckians on the fight against the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). “We will get through this together because we understand the different steps that it will take, especially being healthy at work, to make sure that we can reopen, that we can revive our economy, that we can create our economy of the future,” said Beshear. “We can do this in a way that makes sure we come out stronger than we were going into this pandemic.” The governor spoke about the Thursday night protest in Louisville over Breonna Taylor’s death. Beshear and other officials also offered updates about remote driver’s license and I.D. card renewal, Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO) contracts and long-term care facilities. Case information As of 5 p.m. May 29, Beshear said there were at least 9,464 coronavirus cases in Kentucky, 283 of which were newly confirmed Friday. “Today’s report is up, and up a fair amount, in cases. We’ll have to wait the next couple days to see whether it is just labs getting caught up from the weekend or whether it is in and of itself significant and something we’ll see moving forward,” said Beshear. “If you look at the last four days on average, it would be 158 cases per day.” Beshear reported nine new deaths Friday, raising the total to 418 Kentuckians lost to the virus. The deaths reported Friday include 51-, 74- and 88-year-old men and 70-, 83- and 90-year-old women from Butler County; 64- and 68-year-old men from Gallatin County; and a 55-year-old man from Oldham County. “These are nine families that again need us to light our homes, places of business and places of worship up green for compassion,” said Beshear. “With the events of the last couple days, compassion is something we ought to have on full display.” At least 3,231 Kentuckians have recovered from the virus. For additional information, including up-to-date lists of positive cases and deaths, as well as breakdowns of coronavirus infections by county, race and ethnicity, click here. Louisville protest Beshear spoke about Thursday night’s protest in Louisville over the shooting death of Breonna Taylor. Previously, he has called for further investigation of her death. Gov. Beshear encouraged all Kentuckians to seek justice peacefully and to listen to the concerns, fears and experiences of black or African-American community members. “This is a very concerning shooting of an EMT, a young woman who worked to save lives of others here in Kentucky,” said Gov. Beshear. “In a broader context, this pandemic we’re facing has laid bare the inequalities that still exist in our society and that many times are fatal.” He commended the protestors for largely following CDC guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19. He also highlighted the disproportionate number of COVID-19 cases and deaths among black or African-American Kentuckians and committed to doing everything he could to reduce health inequality. “While I’m trying to provide the right words, I don’t claim to understand the depths of pain and frustration that I know so many people feel,” Beshear said. “I can’t. But what I can commit to do is to listen and to do my best. To tell you that I want to move this world into a better place.” Remote driver’s license and I.D. card renewal Transportation Cabinet Secretary Jim Gray signed an executive order temporarily authorizing circuit court clerk offices to process expired driving credential renewals and replacement requests remotely. Cardholders whose operator’s license, permit or identification card was lost or expired between March 1 and June 30, 2020, may apply with their local circuit court clerk to receive a new card in the mail. For more information, click here. “This order is the next right step to help clerks safely serve Kentuckians impacted by the office closures caused by the pandemic,” said Beshear. “The temporary measure will allow contactless service to help minimize crowding and help offices gradually return to full-service operations.” Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO) contracts Beshear and Cabinet for Health and Family Services Secretary Eric Friedlander today announced the Commonwealth of Kentucky has awarded the state’s Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO) contract to five health care companies that will manage benefits for the state’s Medicaid enrollees. The five companies are Aetna, Humana, Molina Healthcare, UnitedHealthcare and WellCare. Aetna will also serve children in Kentucky SKY, the Medicaid risk-based managed care delivery program for the state foster care program and the Department for Juvenile Justice. “Health care is a basic human right, and ensuring coverage for approximately 90% of Medicaid’s 1.4 million population is of the utmost importance to my administration,” Beshear said. “The expansion of Medicaid in the commonwealth has been lifesaving for many families who struggled to find and afford coverage. As we move forward, we must continue to provide equal access for every Kentuckian who needs quality care.” For more information, click here. Long-term care facilities Secretary Friedlander said the state has acted swiftly and aggressively when long-term care facilities have been in distress. After testing indicated an outbreak at a Louisville facility over the weekend, state agencies and Louisville Metro worked together to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect the residents and staff at Nazareth Home Clifton. They moved 39 residents who tested positive into local hospitals. “This is an aggressive disease in long-term care. These are our most vulnerable citizens. These are our moms and our dads,” the secretary said. “We are testing over 1,000, sometimes 2,000 folks a day and we’ll continue to do that until we get every last person tested, and that’s our commitment.” He said they have tested about 15,000 residents and staff in long-term care facilities so far and will test another 5,000 to 10,000 next week.

Minutes later, they safely entered orbit.“Let's light this candle,” Hurley said just before ignition, borrowing the words used by Alan Shepard on America's first human spaceflight, in 1961.The two men are scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station on Sunday for a stay of up to four months, after which they will return to Earth in a Right Stuff-style splashdown at sea.The mission unfolded amid the gloom of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 100,000 Americans, and racial unrest across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. NASA officials and others held out hope the flight would would be a morale-booster.“Maybe there’s an opportunity here for America to maybe pause and look up and see a bright, shining moment of hope at what the future looks like, that the United States of America can do extraordinary things even in difficult times,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said before launch.With the on-time liftoff, SpaceX, founded by Musk, the Tesla electric-car visionary, became the first private company to launch people into orbit, a feat achieved previously by only three governments: the U.S., Russia and China.The flight also ended a nine-year launch drought for NASA, the longest such hiatus in its history. Ever since it retired the space shuttle in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spaceships launched from Kazakhstan to take U.S. astronauts to and from the space station.In the intervening years, NASA outsourced the job of designing and building its next generation of spaceships to SpaceX and Boeing, awarding them $7 billion in contracts in a public-private partnership aimed at driving down costs and spurring innovation. Boeing’s spaceship, the Starliner capsule, is not expected to fly astronauts until early 2021.Musk said earlier in the week that the project is aimed at “reigniting the dream of space and getting people fired up about the future.”Ultimately, NASA hopes to rely in part on its commercial partners as it works to send astronauts back to the moon in the next few years, and on to Mars in the 2030s.Before setting out for the launch pad in a gull-wing Tesla SUV — another Musk product — Behnken pantomimed a hug of his 6-year-old son, Theo, and said: “Are you going to listen to Mommy and make her life easy?” Hurley blew kisses to his 10-year-old son and wife.A launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes to go in the countdown because of lightning. On Saturday, stormy weather in Florida threatened another postponement for most of the day, but then the skies began to clear in the afternoon just in time.Nine minutes after liftoff, the rocket's first stage booster landed, as designed, on a barge a few hundred miles off the Florida coast.Inside Kennedy Space Center, attendance was strictly limited because of the coronavirus, and the small crowd of a few thousand was a shadow of what it would have been without the threat of COVID-19. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence flew in for the event for the second time in four days.By NASA’s count, over 3 million viewers tuned in online.Despite NASA’s insistence that the public stay safe by staying home, spectators gathered along beaches and roads hours in advance.Among them was Neil Wight, a machinist from Buffalo, New York, who staked out a view of the launch pad from a park in Titusville.“It’s pretty historically significant in my book, and a lot of other people’s books. With everything that’s going on in this country right now, it’s important that we do things extraordinary in life,” Wight said. “We’ve been bombarded with doom and gloom for the last six, eight weeks, whatever it is, and this is awesome. It brings a lot of people together.”The astronauts were kept in quasi-quarantine for more than two months before liftoff. The SpaceX technicians who helped them get into their spacesuits wore masks and gloves that made them look like black-clad ninjas. And at the launch center, the SpaceX controllers were seated far apart.Hurley, a 53-year-old retired Marine, and Behnken, 49, an Air Force colonel, are veterans of two space shuttle flights each. Hurley piloted the space shuttle on the last launch of astronauts from Kennedy, on July 8, 2011.In keeping with Musk’s penchant for futuristic flash, the astronauts wore angular white uniforms with black trim. Instead of the usual multitude of dials, knobs and switches, the Dragon capsule has three large touchscreens.SpaceX has been launching cargo capsules to the space station since 2012. In preparation for Wednesday’s flight, SpaceX sent up a Dragon capsule with only a test dummy aboard last year, and it docked smoothly at the orbiting outpost on autopilot, then returned to Earth in a splashdown.During the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and shuttle programs, NASA relied on aerospace contractors to build spacecraft according to the agency’s designs. NASA owned and operated the ships.Under the new, 21st-century partnership, aerospace companies design, build, own and operate the spaceships, and NASA is essentially a paying customer on a list that could eventually include non-government researchers, artists and tourists. (Tom Cruise has already expressed interest.)“What Elon Musk has done for the American space program is he has brought vision and inspiration that we hadn’t had” since the shuttle’s retirement in 2011, Bridenstine said on the eve of launch. He called the SpaceX chief “brilliant” and said Musk has “absolutely delivered” for NASA.The mission is technically considered by SpaceX and NASA to be a test flight. The next SpaceX voyage to the space station, set for the end of August, will have a full, four-person crew: three Americans and one Japanese.Wednesday’s first human flight was originally targeted for around 2015. But NASA’s commercial crew program encountered bureaucratic delays and technical setbacks.A SpaceX capsule exploded on the test stand last year. Boeing’s first Starliner capsule ended up in the wrong orbit during an crew-less test flight in December and was nearly destroyed at the mission’s end. Both companies had trouble with such things as the landing parachutes.",0.0

Black life disrespected, expendable and cheap. Beaten, raped, stabbed, shot, dismembered, lynched, burned and dragged to death. The violence of it all. The brutality of it all. The protection of it all. The justification of it all. The sheer calculus of it all. The colonization of black lives continues uninterrupted and with little consequence. There is no safe place. And we are angry. Breonna Taylor was in the sanctuary of her own home in the early hours of night when Louisville law enforcement made their deadly raid. Another black woman was killed, never to rise again in this mortal frame. Kenneth Walker, the love of her life, was initially arrested and jailed for defending their home in the ill-fated raid before later being released. Family and friends, loved ones and allies want to know what possible pretext could exist for the continued mistreatment and killing of black lives. There is none. Multiracial community, in intersectional witness, filled downtown streets in protest. Read this: 911 call from Breonna Taylor shooting: 'Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend' I live in Louisville, and I am angry. Ahmaud Arbery was jogging while black through a neighborhood in Brunswick, Georgia, when a self-proclaimed citizen’s arrest turned deadly. He didn’t live far from where he was followed, filmed, accosted and shot twice in the chest. It didn’t matter. Another mother’s son, another grieving father’s child, another black life gone, in a world turned callous and cold to his dreams and possibilities. After video of the shootings emerged, arrests were made. My beloved comes from that southeast region of coastal Georgia, less than an hour away. Multiracial coalitions against murder have risen in powerful protest, and I am angry. George Floyd is the Minneapolis man who died in police custody mere days ago. The video is harrowing. So many of them are. Still, justice is not guaranteed. What this one shows is a police officer kneeling, pressing down on the nape of Floyd’s neck, the back of his head, an authority figure, oblivious to bystanders’ entreaties to stop. For several agonizing minutes, handcuffed on his stomach, nose bleeding, body ground into the pavement, Floyd gasped for air, pleaded for breath, and called out to his deceased mother with his dying words. Across the nation, the people are taking to the streets. I am a black man from Minnesota, and I am angry. The world has not changed much since the pandemic. In some ways, perhaps, it has. Tragically, the coronavirus has taken the lives of hundreds of thousands of people the world over. More lives will doubtless be lost to us. The world of pandemic has infected, impacted and decimated countless millions more. Engrained social inequities in our health care systems have especially been exposed. We are sore distressed. We grieve for the children of God everywhere, lost to our world too soon. 'This virus is just as deadly': Louisville's gun violence interventionists fight COVID-19 Many people yearn for a “return to normal.” Others speak of a ""new normal.” I am not interested in either scenario. Racism, that most common of American diseases, is the other viral strain currently ravaging our society. It is scarcely mentioned in polite company, except when the people raise their voices in protest. The convergence of pandemic and black suffering, from the denial and absence of health care to heightened rates of death and harassment on public streets, is not something many white Americans want to hear or accept. It is profoundly true. Alton B. Pollard III is president of the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary. (Photo: provided) Resistant to the winds of change, American racism continues to rear its ugly head. Differently presented in white supremacist and respectable white culture, it is no less destructive and dehumanizing. Debilitating to our national health and well-being, it powerfully resurfaces time and time again to expose our country’s self-inflicted and deep-seated wounds. In our transgressions, the obsession with hierarchy and arrogance of empire, we have made black communities especially susceptible to disease and death. We have exported our brand of racial death and social contradiction to the world. The fear, hatred, bigotry, illogic and indifference associated with racism is chilling and manifest. It finds its way into forms of personal decision, policy-making and insouciant policing. It radically diminishes the life chances of many. Racism has long been America’s original sin. Amid a pandemic, now as before, I see black death everywhere. I am angry and have every right to be. The magnificent Audre Lorde said it best: “We use whatever strengths we have fought for, including anger, to help define and fashion a world where all our sisters can grow, where our children can love, and where the power of touching and meeting another woman’s difference and wonder will transcend the need for destruction.” Fury and anger between equals and peers — when there is a knee on our necks, an invasion of our homes, in the very taking of our lives — is an act of righteous resistance, an insurrection against power and privilege, and an invitation for all into solidarity. May it be so. Alton B. Pollard III is president and professor of religion and culture at Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary.

Klobuchar has suspended her campaign and endorsed Biden before the upcoming Super Tuesday Democratic presidential primaries.

Amy Klobuchar seems a less likely choice to become Joe Biden's running mate on his presidential ticket following this week's death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis, a key ally of the former vice president said Friday. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., told reporters that while he believes Klobuchar is “absolutely” qualified to be vice president, “This is very tough timing for her.” Klobuchar, D-Minn., was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. As she was leaving the post to join the Senate, an officer involved in this week’s death of George Floyd was involved in the death of another man. The officer ultimately was not prosecuted. Clyburn, who said his view was his “gut feeling,” played a pivotal role in helping Biden become the party’s all-but-certain presidential nominee. Clyburn is the No. 3 House Democratic leader and Congress’ highest-ranking black lawmaker.Related: NY protesters demand justice for George Floyd“So often in politics, timing really dictates things, Barack Obama I don’t think could have gotten elected four years before he got elected,"" Clyburn said of the former president during a conference call. “And I don’t know whether he could get elected today.”On MSNBC, Biden said the tensions in Minnesota have “nothing to do with my running mate.” Pressed on whether Floyd’s killing increases pressure to place an African American woman on his ticket, Biden said he's talked about putting women of color on the Supreme Court and in his Cabinet. “And I also already said that there are women of color under consideration,"" he said. Clyburn helped revive Biden’s badly flagging presidential campaign earlier this year, lifting him to a decisive triumph in a South Carolina primary in which large numbers of voters were black. That fueled a Biden run to a string of victories in other state contests that resulted in his becoming the party’s presumptive nominee. Before being elected to the Senate in 2006, Klobuchar, who is white, was prosecutor of Minnesota's largest county, which includes Minneapolis. While Klobuchar was in that job, more than two dozen citizens died during encounters with police but none of the officers involved were criminally charged. Most victims were people of color, according to data compiled by Communities United Against Police Brutality and news articles reviewed by the AP. An officer involved in one of the past fatal incidents was Derek Chauvin, who was arrested and charged Friday in this week's death of Floyd. A video showing Floyd complaining that he could not breath as Chauvin kneeled on his neck has helped spark unrest in cities around the country. Chauvin was among six officers who fired on and killed a man in 2006 who reportedly stabbed two people and then aimed a shotgun at police. The case went to the grand jury after Klobuchar had been elected to the Senate and had left the county attorney’s office. Klobuchar did not respond to a request by The Associated Press for an interview on Friday. But she told NBC news that reports stating she had declined the case involving Chauvin years ago were “absolutely false.”Klobuchar told the network that during the years she led the office, it was the practice to present police shooting cases to a grand jury to consider charges. She said she now believes the practice of asking a grand jury to decide whether to charge officers was wrong. Klobuchar and 27 other Democratic senators wrote a letter Friday to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, asking it to investigate “patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing” by the Minneapolis police. ___AP reporters Sara Burnett in Chicago and Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.",0.0

Protestors broke three windows in the Cathedral rectory — where Archbishop Joseph E. Kurtz and Father Michael Wimsatt reside — at about midnight during a May 29 demonstration that began peacefully that afternoon. Those windows were also covered with plywood. In a May 29 letter to Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, Archbishop Joseph E. Kurtz expressed his support of peaceful protests “that give voice to the pain of the community and to the desire for truth and justice to be served.” He also said he lamented the “senseless violence” that developed overnight after peaceful protests had drawn hundreds to downtown Louisville May 28. Louisville protesters joined demonstrators in major cities around the country demanding justice for victims of police violence and racism May 28 and 29. They chanted “No justice, no peace” as they made their way through the streets of the downtown area, stopping periodically to chant and block intersections. During the May 28 protest, shots were fired by a person or persons in the crowd and seven people were wounded, according to the Louisville Metro Police Department. And three protesters were arrested after windows in Metro Corrections properties were broken, according to local news reports. As protests resumed the afternoon of May 29, local leaders were calling for them to remain peaceful. Late that night and into the early hours of the morning, police in riot gear fogged protesters with tear gas and demonstrators shattered windows of downtown buildings — including the Cathedral’s rectory — and looted area stores. Six protesters were arrested and six officers were injured, according to the Louisville Metro Police Department. The protests were sparked by the deaths of Louisville emergency medical worker Breonna Taylor and George Floyd of Minneapolis. A police officer in Minneapolis has been charged with murder after being captured on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a forgery suspect, on Memorial Day. Floyd was pinned to the ground as the officer knelt on his neck for eight minutes. Floyd struggles to say, “I can’t breathe,” repeatedly and eventually appears to lose consciousness or die. He was declared dead at a hospital afterward. Breonna Taylor, 26, was shot to death March 13 by Louisville Metro Police when officers entered her home in plain clothes on a “no-knock warrant,” meaning they could enter her home without identifying themselves or knocking. Thinking they were being robbed, Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired at the officers, the Associated Press reported. Taylor was shot eight times. The FBI is investigating. In response to protests, Mayor Fischer announced he will temporarily suspend no-knock warrants. The Metro Louisville chief of police has also announced his retirement in the wake of the Breonna Taylor shooting. On May 30, the mayor called for a curfew in Jefferson County from 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. He also has called in the Kentucky National Guard. In consultation with the mayor’s office, the Cathedral of the Assumption has canceled the Saturday evening Mass today, May 30, said Dr. Brian B. Reynolds, chancellor and chief administrative officer of the Archdiocese of Louisville. “Archbishop visited the downtown area this morning. He and the pastor of the Cathedral, Father Michael, spoke and assessed the damage done to the residence,” he said. “Now the priority is to ensure people are safe. The best way is to ensure people aren’t downtown during the curfew.” Reynolds said he has been in touch with pastors in affected neighborhoods and noted, “Churches are considering the best ways to respond to the pastoral needs of their communities.” He added that the archbishop’s May 29 message to the mayor remains unchanged: “Our fellow citizens are suffering and distraught and everyone is on edge due to many factors that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 virus,” Archbishop Kurtz said in his letter to the mayor. “The hope promised by our faith is that the crosses we bear can have a transformative effect as we seek, with God’s grace, to build a better future for all.” “I stand with you as we all work to build a better Louisville in which all citizens thrive and in which there is a shared commitment to the common good.” The letter concluded, “I can assure you that the parishes and faithful of the archdiocese will be praying for you and for a peaceful and just resolution to this situation.”",0.0

For more than four hours, flash grenades volleyed through the air like cannon fire, booming above teenagers’ heads while the tat-tat-tat of pepper balls rattled in their ears. Tear gas wafted across entire city blocks, seeping into their eyes and lungs — the searing pain leaving some in tears, others blindly grasping for the reprieve offered by a stranger with a gallon of milk. By 10 p.m., downtown Louisville looked like a war zone. “We just came here because we want peace,” said Louisville native Juliana Ramos, 19. “And we want to stop being killed.” Read more: Fischer sets curfew, calls in National Guard for Breonna Taylor protests But by sunrise Saturday, their demands for justice were overshadowed by widespread property damage, as Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and other officials focused their attention on preventing another night of mass unrest — including the announcement of a citywide curfew set to begin by nightfall. The curfew, officials hope, will keep hundreds of teens and young adults from returning to the downtown corridor for the third night in a row. By early evening, it remained unclear whether youth would heed the directive. What has been clear, said Shameka Parrish-Wright, a local activist, is that Louisville's youth are not scared to stand ""toe to toe"" with law enforcement in protest. ""They're watching and seeing how other people are reacting and are like, 'Hell yeah, let's do this,'"" she said. ""These young people were out here pushing for change."" ICYMI: Second night of protests marked by vandalism in downtown Louisville 'I could be another funeral' Kayla Webb, 19, of Louisville, was among those who spent hours facing down a line of roughly 50 police officers in front of Metro Hall on Friday evening. Chanting, ""No justice, no peace!"", they held banners that read ""#JusticeForBreonna"" and ""Enough is Enough."" ""As a black woman,"" Webb said, "" ... it's terrifying to know that one mistake, one slip of my hand, to reach for something, to breathe wrong, to look at someone wrong, I could be murdered."" ""I could have no future,"" she continued. ""I could just be another statistic. I could be another funeral. I could be another T-shirt spray-painted at the flea market."" Molly Wallace, 19, stood shoulder to shoulder with Webb. At one point, Wallace said some protesters threw water bottles at the officers’ direction. She was hit with pepper bullets and tear gas, she said. “I was really scared, I'm not gonna lie,” said Wallace, a Louisville resident. “But I also know that I'm white,"" she said. ""I am not nearly the same risk of being attacked and being assaulted by the police as any person of color. And so, I didn't know if it was necessarily my place to be right up front protesting as a white person, but I felt like in this situation I am so much safer than any person of color.” Nearby, government buildings were tagged with spray-painted messages denigrating the police. Shards of glass were scattered at the entrance to the Hall of Justice, where protesters earlier in the evening had hurled plastic water bottles at the window panes. Acknowledging the property damage, Webb said black people have been ""trying to protest civilly for the right to be treated as human beings"" for decades. Wearing glasses and an oversized sweater, Webb said she felt ""rage"" looking at the officers in full riot gear. The pain of the black community is ""so deeply wound into the fabric of our history and our condition that we don't even see all the ways that it manifests,"" she said. ""But it's there."" Related: Fischer, Louisville police blame looting at protest on out-of-towners 'A traumatized generation' Though sparked by the recent high-profile deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and Louisville’s own Breonna Taylor, the protests that erupted in the city on Thursday and Friday nights were, in many ways, years in the making for a generation rocked by unrest. Those graduating high school this month among the Class of 2020, for example, were in the fourth grade when Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old black boy, was shot and killed in his Florida neighborhood. They were in the seventh grade when Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy carrying a toy pellet gun, was shot and killed by a Cleveland police officer. By the time they entered high school in the fall of 2016 — just months before President Donald Trump was elected — Black Lives Matter had emerged as a national political and social justice movement. White supremacists rallied in Charlottesville, Virginia, the summer before their sophomore year. Six months later, the tragedy at a Parkland, Florida, high school launched the “March for Our Lives” movement, with teens calling for action against gun violence writ large — including shootings by police officers. Ramos, who has family in both Louisville and Miami, said her brother was the victim of a fatal police shooting in Florida. 'We've got no choice': Frustrated protesters say police brutality, injustice must end “I don't want to lose anybody else,” she said. “I don't want to be afraid to leave my house. I've been pulled over and dragged out of my car and asked if I have my immigration papers. ""I was born in the United States,"" Ramos continued. ""I'm tired of watching this happen.” Webb, a student at Northern Kentucky University, said Friday evening she and other younger people would not back down. Though she was “terrified” of what could happen at the protest, she was “more angry than anything else.” ""You have to realize these kids are organized and tired and they just want justice,"" said Parrish-Wright, the activist. ""They've watched it their whole lives,"" she said. ""It's all they know. ""This is a traumatized generation.""

Bring Kaepernick back,http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/625636236/0/cincinnati-home~Opinion-NFL-has-a-chance-to-be-on-right-side-of-history-Bring-Kaepernick-back/,en,False,,82890,nky.cincinnati.com,http://nky.cincinnati.com/#spider,"CLOSE SportsPulse: After a bizarre day that ended in a workout at a high school football field, Colin Kaepernick spoke with the media and explains that he's been 'ready' for a long time. USA TODAY The NFL botched its attempt to properly welcome Colin Kaepernick back when the league hastily put together a private workout in Atlanta. Days before Kaepernick’s workout last November, The Enquirer talked to members around the NFL who had already ruled out any chance of signing the quarterback. It was a disingenuous attempt to reintegrate Kaepernick back to the NFL. Kaepernick hasn’t played since the 2016 season. In that year, he knelt during the national anthem as a form of protest against racial injustice and police brutality. His final game was Jan. 1, 2017. It’s a shame Kaepernick has been ostracized from the NFL ever since. Colin Kaepernick (7) kneels before an NFL game in 2016. (Photo: Kyle Terada, USA TODAY Sports) Nothing’s changed from the time Kaepernick took his last knee on an NFL sideline until now. In a painful coincidence, the knee of a fired Minneapolis police officer is in the news for precisely what Kaepernick was protesting about. Yet, some attempted to change the narrative of Kaepernick’s message, and others tried to disguise their racism with erroneous patriotism and refused to listen. Kaepernick is not the figure head of political activism in sports. Jessie Owens, John Carlos, Tommie Smith, Muhammad Ali, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Craig Hodges, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and more used their platform to shed light on racial inequities. The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback brought attention to systemic racism during the burgeoning social media era. In this Oct. 16, 1968, file photo, Australian silver medalist Peter Norman, left, stands on the podium as Americans Tommie Smith, center, and John Carlos raise their gloved fists in a human rights protest. (Photo: AP) It’s not the NFL’s job to fix systemic racism. But the NFL can help spark change. The NFL financially backed the Players Coalition, which was founded in 2017 by Anquan Boldin and Malcolm Jenkins. The group’s mission is to make an impact on social justice and racial equality at the federal, state and local levels. However, the league has simultaneously shunned Kaepernick. Kaepernick’s return to the NFL would show that his peaceful protest deserved to be commended as opposed to condemned. Yet, team executives are concerned about the backlash they might receive for signing Kaepernick. Some believe it will negatively affect their bottom line. But shouldn’t morals and values be more important than monetary profit? If a certain portion of the NFL fanbase is more outraged by Kaepernick kneeling over unarmed black and brown people being killed in the streets – then good riddance. Over 70% of NFL athletes are black. Those players, their fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters or cousins could’ve suffered the same catastrophic consequence as Oscar Grant, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and the many other blacks wrongfully killed.

The venue was changed at the last minute to a local high school. (Photo: Carmen Mandato, Getty Images) It’s okay for black athletes to entertain, but the community they represent can’t live in an equitable society? And when they do speak out, they are met with responses such as ""shut up and dribble"" or ""stick to sports."" The unmitigated gall of those with that belief deserve to be blackballed, not Kaepernick. As a society, we all should be better. There should be a responsibility incumbent upon everyone to fight racism. Kaepernick fought racial injustice and was exiled from the NFL. In a time of crisis, many turn to sports for a diversion. The country is hurting from the COVID-19 pandemic and racial injustices. In the midst of it all, sports are preparing to make a return. The NFL has a prime opportunity to right its wrong. Kaepernick deserves a legitimate opportunity. In return, the NFL would be on the right side of history amid an unprecedent chapter in our country.

1621183472,2020-05-30 18:16:36,"Opinion: Joe Burrow shows rest of NFL that white athletes must protest inequality, too",http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/625620398/0/cincinnati-home~Opinion-Joe-Burrow-shows-rest-of-NFL-that-white-athletes-must-protest-inequality-too/,en,False,,82890,nky.cincinnati.com,http://nky.cincinnati.com/#spider,"Joe Burrow can teach the NFL a thing or two. The rest of America, too. Unlike most prominent white male athletes, who have stayed largely silent about the racism and systemic oppression of people of color in this country, the No. 1 pick in last month’s NFL draft addressed it head on. At his own initiative. “The black community needs our help. They have been unheard for far too long,” Burrow said in a Twitter post Friday. “Open your ears, listen, and speak. This isn’t politics. This is human rights.” The outrage over the death of George Floyd, who died Monday after a white police officer held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, seems like a sea change. Perhaps it’s the sheer brutality of the video of Floyd’s death, with Derek Chauvin appearing calm and impassive to Floyd’s cries that he can’t breathe until his body goes limp. Or maybe it’s exhaustion from the unending bigotry of President Donald Trump, who has emboldened racists and white nationalists to say the quiet things out loud. Whatever it is, the rage and protests roiling the country feel different. Burrow’s heartfelt post, as well as similar statements by Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence and the Eagles' Carson Wentz and Zach Ertz, capture that shift. “It’s very rare to see a white athlete say something to this magnitude,” said Louis Moore, an associate professor of history at Grand Valley State and author of “We Will Win the Day: The Civil Rights Movement, the Black Athlete and the Quest for Equality.” “It’s important because it’s so different,” he added. “But it’s also a call to action. And if they pull through, if they actually do something about it, it can change the tide.” When Colin Kaepernick began taking a knee almost four years ago in protest of police brutality against people of color and the racism at the root of it, he was joined by dozens of other players. But with few exceptions – very few exceptions – those players were also people of color. Sure, there were white players who expressed support for their teammates. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers went so far as to say Kaepernick was being blackballed from the league. But very few white NFL players – and none with the profile and sway to change public opinion – were willing to initiate the conversation or take a visible stand. The message was that this was a problem for black and brown players. It was their communities that were affected. They were the ones who knew the pain and humiliation of being judged by the color of their skin. “That’s just how the movement has always been,” Moore said. Whether that’s out of privilege, ignorance or fear of saying the wrong thing, I don’t know. What I do know is that people of color did not create this structure that is rooted in racism, and they cannot be expected to fix it. Not on their own, at least. White people have to speak up and call for change, too. Particularly those who have a platform. Like, say, an NFL quarterback. Sad as it is to say, the letter from the Players Coalition asking for a federal investigation into the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was chased down and killed by two white men while he was jogging, probably would have gone largely unnoticed had it not been for one name on it. Tom Brady. SPORTS, DELIVERED:Get the latest sports news sent right to your inbox. Sign up here. Brady avoids anything that could be considered even slightly controversial like he does strawberries. So for the six-time Super Bowl champion to add his name to the call for justice was significant. If you’re a fan of the New England Patriots or Tampa Bay Buccaneers, or just Brady in general, and you’ve never much thought about inequality, or you disapproved of Kaepernick, maybe you reconsider the way you think now. If you’re a Clemson fan, maybe you pause and think about your own implicit biases after reading Lawrence’s posts. “There has to be a shift in the way of thinking,” Lawrence said Friday on Twitter. “I’m siding with my brothers that deal, and continuously deal, with things I will never experience. The injustice is clear.. and so is the hate. It can no longer be explained away. If you’re still 'explaining’ it – check your heart and ask why.” And if you’re a black or brown player who has stayed quiet, knowing what happened to Kaepernick, maybe you feel emboldened to speak up, knowing your quarterback has your back. “Being from North Dakota, I’ve spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I’m never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through already,” Wentz said Thursday night. “I’ll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color. “However, I do know that we are all equal at the foot of the cross and Jesus taught us to value others’ lives like they were our own – regardless of skin tone.” Systemic racism is not a black or brown problem. It's a problem, period, one we all need to work to fix. It's nice to see high-profile, white male athletes finally joining in the fight.

He was standing at the corner of Fourth Street and Muhammad Ali Boulevard. It’s also known at Thomas Merton Square, and a historical marker there documents the revelation that Merton, a Catholic monk, had on that corner. “I was suddenly overwhelmed with the realization that I loved all those people,” Merton wrote about that now-famous moment. “[T]hat they were mine and I theirs, that we could not be alien to one another even though we were total strangers.” Sayles, a 25-year-old Black woman from Louisville, had started protesting at 4 p.m. the day before. She watched Fischer’s press conference at 1 a.m. She saw him denounce the violence, she said, and congratulate the police. But she didn’t hear much about why she and the other protesters were upset. And she had a question when she walked up and saw Mayor Greg Fischer: where were you last night? I didn’t know where you were, Fischer responded.

It is unfortunate… it’s very unfair.” In an interview later, Sayles said she knows Fischer personally, though she’s not sure if he recognized her within the context of the confrontation. And the night before, she said she was shot with pepper balls as she peacefully demonstrated. She just walked down the block to survey the damage to a bar owned by a friend of hers. She thought the mayor waited too long to say something to people who are still hurting over the March 13 death of Breonna Taylor by Louisville Metro Police bullets. Fischer said thank you. She kept talking. “You still have officers that are walking around that killed someone in their sleep,” she said, her voice breaking. “An innocent person! And they’re still free.” With that, as she continued to shout, Fischer walked away. The previous night, dozens of business owners saw their windows busted out and inventory looted as Louisville Metro Police and Kentucky State Police officers fired tear gas and pepper balls to disperse crowds. On Thursday, the first night of protests, seven people were shot during a protest that was largely peaceful until that moment. Saturday morning, Fischer was announcing a new state of emergency and a curfew that would be enforced by the National Guard. A reporter asked Sayles if she thought the riots still would have happened even if Fischer came out and spoke. She said she doesn’t know. “I will say that if they would have came out there and absolutely tried to have a discussion with people, people would have listened, and they failed to do that,” she told a WFPL reporter. “They came to us with riot gear. They didn’t come to us to have a conversation.” Sayles said she hopes these protests cause people to pay more attention to the core source of these issues: police brutality, gentrification, poor neighborhood logistics. “I really think the people of Louisville are tired, and I think that we have a wave of energy happening through the country right now that’s been pent up through years and years of oppression,” she said. “You can only shake up a Coke bottle so many times before the top explodes. I think we’re starting to see the top exploding right now.”",0.0

Cincinnati Enquirer When Means Cameron came to open his coffee shop on Elm Street Saturday morning, he was greeted with damaged windows.

We want to know that we're safe. We want to know that we're going to return to our families.""

Among blaCk Coffee's frequent customers is Cincinnati City Councilman Greg Landsman. Saturday morning, Landsman gave Cameron a different kind of pick-me-up by paying for an hour's worth of coffee for those coming for their daily beverages. He figures it costs around $100.

""That was just a reminder that our shop is loved, appreciated and people want our shop to be right where it is through all of this,"" Cameron said. ""It was really encouraging, the pour-out of support. We're grateful. That shows that people that are out doing these acts, disrupting the city and tearing the city down, they're actually a minority.

Cameron said supporters came from all parts of the area. ""He's an amazing entrepreneur and someone that everybody loves,"" Landsman said. ""They (vandals) should know that they took a shot at a whole host of people who have been working their tails off on dreams that they've had for a long time."" Cameron saw the day as a negative that turned to a positive. People pulled together and blaCk Coffee Lounge had more visitors than they might have had minus the incident. Still, the owner was concerned about Saturday night despite the curfew. He also planned on checking his business Sunday morning even though they're closed Sundays and Mondays. ""I understand that people are hurt and don't know how to respond,"" Cameron said. ""But, it's important to not become a follower. Even in times when you're unsure about how you feel. As a black man, I worry about, 'Am I going home to my family tonight?' on top of the other things we have to process as minority business owners."" The Dater High and Miami University grad remains high on his spot near 9th and Elm and high on his city. ""We have a beautiful city,"" Cameron said. ""It can be a leading city, but it's going to take some work. I'm willing to put the work in, though I don't know if I'll ever live in a Cincinnati that's representative.

Jacob Ryan of KyCIR said he and other WFPL reporters were walking alongside a couple hundred protesters getting herded through downtown by a line of law enforcement. As they made a left on to Sixth Street, past the federal building, the crowd separated. Some cut down the alley and some went onto Broadway, Ryan said. “That’s where we heard the shots.” The police ordered everyone to the ground and started shooting pellets into the crowd, Ryan said. It was unclear whether anyone was struck by gunfire; reporters saw police arresting or detaining two people in the immediate aftermath of the gunshots. A police spokesperson confirmed the report of shots fired and said they would let us know when there are victims to report. Highlands Protest Grew Unruly A protest in the Highlands neighborhood was described as calm by city officials around 10:30 p.m., but shortly after 11 p.m. police began firing flash bangs and tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd. The standoff between National Guard and demonstrators was centered at the intersection of Highland and Baxter avenues, near the Starbucks and post office. A reporter on scene said tear gas was fired, but the police line hadn’t advanced toward the crowd. I take that back. Pepper balls, flash bangs in Highlands.

Tonight is the first night the city is under a 9 p.m. curfew, enforced by the National Guard along with Louisville Metro Police and Kentucky State Police. At his first press briefing since the curfew began, Mayor Greg Fischer said police had arrested about 10 people who “disregarded orders to disperse.” He said he did not know the origin of the people who were arrested. Fischer has said that outside agitators are contributing to unrest in Louisville. He said the city changed tactics following the destruction of property that took place Friday night. He also described the crowd as smaller and easier to manage than on the previous two nights, and thanked those who did not break the curfew. “I want to thank the people of Louisville for contributing to this being a relatively safe night so far, for peacefully protesting for change,” he said, “and I continue to commit to being your partner to work toward that change on what we can do here locally, and advocate at the state and federal level for more change.” Tracy Dotson, a spokesperson for Metro Corrections union, said they don’t have exact numbers yet, but arrests are “many and steady right now… Night and day compared to the last two days.” There were two main protest locations: downtown around Metro Hall, and through the Highlands, where protesters last night and tonight walked down Bardstown Road and peacefully demonstrated. While much of downtown suffered broken windows and looting during demonstrations last night, there were only a couple isolated incidents of vandalism in the Highlands. Around 10 p.m., WFPL reporters stationed throughout downtown Louisville reported a large crowd between Metro and City Halls and police action to move protesters east on Market Street. Two reporters who had been tracking alongside law enforcement were ordered back as the officers moved on the crowd and fired pepper balls. The officers were not warning before firing.

A USA Today reporter filmed law enforcement dumping out water and milk jugs left out for protesters, and reporters on the scene said flash bangs, green smoke and tear gas were already being deployed before 8:30 p.m. Later in the evening, Fischer said the milk jugs and water bottles contained “flammable” materials.

1621223630,2020-05-30 20:49:51,At least 5 of 6 protesters arrested in Louisville demonstrations Friday were locals,http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625644666/0/courierjournal/home~At-least-of-protesters-arrested-in-Louisville-demonstrations-Friday-were-locals/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Although Louisville officials and their counterparts across the nation have often blamed ""out-of-towners"" for damaging their cities during recent protests, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said Sunday that most people who have been arrested live in Louisville. All six people arrested at Friday's Breonna Taylor protests are Louisville residents, their arrest citations show. And of the 40 to 50 people arrested Saturday night, Fischer said Sunday evening, ""the vast majority of those, as I understand it, are from Louisville."" Citations connected to each of Saturday's arrests, which would identify where the suspects live, were not available on Sunday. A representative from the clerk's office said he believed they would all be available the following day. Of the citations that were available Sunday evening, though, the majority concerned individuals who live in Louisville. Residents of Elizabethtown and Frankfort were also arrested, the Saturday citations show, as well as three people from Charlotte, North Carolina. Instances of looting marred Friday night's protests, which led to officials calling in the National Guard on Saturday and issuing a dusk-to-dawn curfew. But Mikel Carter, 26, of Louisville, was the only person accused in the arrest reports of looting that evening. Police, who responded to a report of looting at an address connected to a cash advance business on Broadway on Saturday just after 2:30 a.m., said they saw him leaving the building with his arms full of merchandise. He was caught as he tried to flee the scene, his arrest citation said, and the merchandise was recovered. Read this: Greg Fischer, Louisville police blame looting at Breonna Taylor protest on out-of-towners Carter was charged with third-degree burglary and a number of other minor charges. He was the only person arrested in a looting incident following Friday's protests — all others are accused of refusing to follow dispersal orders and were charged with unlawful assembly. Steven Holliger, 44, faces an extra charge of disorderly conduct. His arrest citation said he refused to leave the street after being told to do so and tried to break through a police line. Four others — Cody Carson, 25, John Stephenson, 26, Jessica Arrington and Betheny Patrick — face a single charge of unlawful assembly after police said they failed to disperse when they were told to do so. Those four were arrested by the same officer at the same time (10:15 p.m.) at the same location (Jefferson Park), and their arrest citations, which state they failed to disperse after being told to do so, are nearly identical. Arrington came alone to the protest on Friday. She was arrested at 10:15 p.m. and was released the next day around 1 p.m., she said, after spending much of the night in a holding cell. Dozens more were arrested at Saturday night's protests. ""It's punitive,"" she said on Sunday. ""They're trying to keep us in there, in the coronavirus situation, in a punitive way, when we were peacefully protesting. Maybe it was during a riot, but we weren't rioting, and they know that. I get out, and I can't hug my 5-year-old child."" Her lawyer, Karen Faulkner, told The Courier Journal that they planned to fight the charges. Fischer and Louisville police had initially said that they believed the damage that took place downtown on Friday was done by protesters from out of town who had come to Louisville. They said they determined that by, among other things, watching license plates and tracking social media posts. Those out-of-towners won't be here to rebuild after the demonstrations, Fischer said. Across the nation, where protests have cropped up over the killings of Taylor, George Floyd in Minneapolis and others, other city leaders have also issued statements pointing to out-of-town demonstrators causing the most serious damages. Read this: Mayor Fischer sets curfew, calls in National Guard for Breonna Taylor protests Taylor, a 26-year-old unarmed black woman, was shot and killed by police on March 13 in her Louisville apartment. Several downtown businesses, including the Omni Louisville Hotel, Eddie Merlot's steakhouse and the CVS on Fourth Street, were damaged and looted Friday night and early Saturday, and many other buildings were vandalized, with windows broken and planters overturned across the area. Other buildings in the area were damaged on Saturday, though looting did not appear to be an issue. This story has been updated with the name of a previously unidentified individual who was arrested.

It began just after 7:30 p.m. in Jefferson Square as protesters demonstrated on behalf of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed black woman fatally shot by Louisville Metro Police Department in March. As a crowd of several hundred people blocked Jefferson and Sixth streets, an unmarked dark gray Ford truck with a siren on, sped over the curve, up onto the grass, nearly striking multiple people including a reporter. Two masked men in plain clothes immediately got out and began to smash the milk and water onto the ground in what appeared to be organized by law enforcement. “That’s our water! We are being peaceful,” one black female protester yelled. She then began to cry. I cannot believe what I just witnessed. They pulled up onto the square with a police siren on and did this. #Louisvillepic.twitter.com/65o2lgZCJh — Natalie Neysa Alund (@nataliealund) May 30, 2020 Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer addressed the incident when asked during a 10:30 p.m. press briefing. The third-term mayor said Mason jars full of flammable materials were included in the protesters' pile of supplies, along with other materials he could not yet identify that could have harmed protesters as well as police. ""The best decision for the safety of everybody was to remove those materials,"" Fischer said. Protesters have stockpiled water and milk to use for relief in case they are exposed to tear gas. Read this: Mayor Fischer sets curfew, calls in National Guard for Breonna Taylor protests Uniformed Kentucky State Police surrounded the truck and allowed the men to throw the remaining cases of water into the truck’s bed. About 45 minutes later, witnesses watched the same truck drive up on grass next to a concrete planter on the other side of the square. The same two men got out, this time wearing black T-shirts that read POLICE in white lettering on the back. Again, troopers blocked protesters from getting to the water and milk as the police officers threw their beverages to the ground. “I watched them stabbing water bottles,” said Tiffany Kilgore, 32, of Louisville, shaking her head. “They’re supposed to help us not hurt us. I just don’t get it.” The protest Saturday night is the third that's taken place in Louisville and is part of a string of demonstrations across the nation against police brutality. Louisville's protests are on behalf of Taylor, while others were sparked by the killings of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia.

The incident was broadcast live on the air. ""Who are they aiming that at?"" the anchor asked.

Videos of the incident showed protesters cursing at Fox and criticizing right-wing media.Correspondent Leland Vittert, cameraman Christian Galdabini and two security guards left the park as the crowd grew more and more hostile. According to Fox, ""Vittert and the crew were punched and hit with projectiles as they fled, and a Fox News camera was broken when a member of the mob tried to grab it.""Journalists from rival outlets supported the Fox crew and condemned the violence.

What is it that America has failed to hear?"" - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 1967 LOUISVILLE, Ky. — After seeing what happened in Minneapolis and violence that transpired Thursday night in Louisville, many people are asking why did something peaceful turn violent? To understand why peaceful protests, like the one for Breonna Taylor, can escalate into violence or riots we must look at the past. Words delivered by civil rights icon Dr. Marin Luther King Jr. nearly 53 years ago still speak to what's happening now. In his speech, ""The Other America,"" from 1953, King said the following: ""I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air. In the final analysis, the riot is the language of the unheard. What is it that America has failed to hear?,"" King questions. ""In a sense, our nation's summers of riots are caused by our winter’s delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these occurrences of riots and violence over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention.” Now that the world is listening, the message from doctor king - who taught us all to dream, still speaks. “In the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear?” pic.twitter.com/Als3jhxaGH — The Martin Luther King, Jr. Center (@TheKingCenter) May 28, 2020 People are outraged over the death of George Floyd - an unarmed black man - who died while in Minneapolis police custody. Four officers involved in the case have been fired. Protesters across the nation are pushing for the officers involved to be charged and prosecuted. People are outraged over the death of Breonna Taylor who was shot and killed multiple times by officers with Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) after they entered her apartment on a no-knock search warrant. Protesters are calling for the three officers involved to be fired and prosecuted. They chanted throughout the rally: ""No justice, no peace. Prosecute the police."" Rev. Jesse Jackson, who marched with Dr. King. was in Minneapolis Thursday pushing for what he calls justice. He spoke with Adrienne Broaddus, at our sister station KARE11, via FaceTime. ""The pain is real. Rioting is the voice of those who truly have no way to express themselves,"" he said shortly after leaving a meeting with Attorney General Keith Ellison. Dr. Shonda Craft is the Dean of the School of Health and Human Services at St. Cloud State University breaks down the psychology behind riots. Craft said when people are gathering it is not only to express rage and frustration but to call for change and find hope in a situation that feels hopeless among people who feel helpless. ""This is a trauma that has happened to one person but the ramifications are being felt throughout a community,"" she said. ""We are in the middle of a pandemic and people are feelings isolation.

""For some people it is going to feel like it is helping because they don't know what else to do with their emotions. They don’t know what else to do with their fear, the anger and their sadness. This feels like something tangible,"" she said. ""It also hurts the reputation of a community. This is the ultimate way of trying to be seen and heard.

1621300287,2020-05-30 13:07:49,"Protesters: The issue is not vandalism, it is police brutality against Black and brown people",https://www.leoweekly.com/2020/05/protesters-issue-not-vandalism-police-brutality-black-brown-people/,en,False,,114483,leoweekly.com,http://leoweekly.com/,"Protesters in Louisville say they don’t want vandalism to be the headline, but it has become one. For a second night, street protests in Louisville turned to vandalism as police moved in Friday evening with tear gas and pepper pellets aimed at an estimated 1,000 protesters. Louisville police, Mayor Greg Fischer and Gov. Andy Beshear contend the property damage done late Friday night was caused by people from outside of the city. But protesters told LEO that they are frustrated over the growing criticism of vandalism and focus on it, because that diverts the public’s attention from the point of the protest — to end police brutality against Black and brown people and get justice in the most recent incidents, including the police killing of Breonna Taylor. As in any political or social movement, there is not always consensus, as was the case among protesters Friday who debated the value and effect of vandalism on their causes. That division was evident when demonstrators lowered the Louisville, Kentucky and American flags from poles in front of Metro Hall and set them on fire to chants of “burn them all!” One nearby protester shook with excitement. “Fuck this country,” she said with a giggle. “That was my brother that brought this flag down. That was the symbolism that all the fucking oppression they have is coming the fuck down.” Less than 6 feet away, another protester scoffed at the scene. “I don’t give a shit about a flag. What I give a shit about is people want to be aggressive, and there’s not really a need to be it,” she said. “I don’t think it’s really fair. I feel like last night was a lot more powerful and passionate. Tonight, it’s just about people trying to cause a problem.” One protester LEO spoke with said that she wanted a peaceful demonstration, but she doesn’t want the destructive actions of some to be the focus. “The issue is what’s going on with the police officers,” said Louisville resident Tiffany Hines as she stood at the downtown intersection of Jefferson and Sixth street at Friday night’s protest before the vandalism began. “It’s not the fact that they broke into Target. That’s the stupid stuff, you know.” The Target that Hines spoke of, which was looted in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has become a national symbol for those critics of vandalism. What Hines really cares about and wants is justice for Breonna Taylor, the Louisville ER tech who was shot and killed in her home by Louisville police officers in March. To Hines, who is 38, justice would be seeing the officers involved in her shooting arrested and charged. But, on Saturday morning, after the protests, Fischer said that the protesters’ goals would not be achieved by damaging property, which escalated on Friday from vandalism to looted stores. “Violence does not bring our city closer to the truth in her case,” he said. “No one stands up for justice and equality by smashing windows and burning property. This destruction will not be tolerated.” Fischer said the city will enforce a dusk-to-dawn curfew at least for the next two days. Six people were arrested Friday night, “some because of looting,” and six officers were injured, the mayor said. Beshear, in a statement released Saturday morning, said he is activating the National Guard to help keep peace in Louisville. Advertisement “The demonstrations in Louisville have all started peacefully, but what we have seen, especially last night, and what our intelligence says is going to happen are outside groups moving in, trying to create violence to harm everybody who is on those streets. We cannot let Breonna’s legacy be marred by violence, and we can’t let our streets turn violent,” Beshear said. On Thursday night, the first evening of mass protests in downtown Louisville, the demonstrations were mostly peaceful. It wasn’t until later in the evening, after the sun had gone down, that protesters began throwing objects at police officers and officers began using tear gas and pepper balls on protesters. Later, as some demonstrators rocked a police transport vehicle, seven citizens were shot. Louisville police say that the bullets came from the crowd. Throughout the night, there was destruction of property including graffiti, burning picnic tables and rocks thrown at city vehicles and into the windows of businesses. Fischer said on Friday morning that the damage to city property was likely not hugely expensive. Friday evening, the vandalism started a few hours into a peaceful protest and was once again met by tear gas and pepper bullets. Sonja de Vries, a longtime activist in Louisville and a member of Louisville Showing Up For Racial Justice, said that Fischer’s comments try to shift the focus away from what she sees as the most important problems. “The issue is white supremacy, racism, police abuse, mass incarceration. Those are the issues,” she said. “And we can’t let them sidetrack us into talking about how people should protest. And you know what, the people in power don’t get to decide how people can protest.” Louisville protesters LEO spoke to almost all said that they wanted peaceful protests on Friday. But they also said they could understand why others might take their anger out on city walls and windows. “I think it’s a deep sense of injustice, a deep sense of alienation, and also not being the owners of anything, including people’s own bodies,” said de Vries. “The idea that someone could be asleep in their bed and have the police break down their door and destroy them. It’s as if they don’t even own their own body.” And a few said that the property being destroyed could easily be taken care of. “I mean, let’s be honest, properties have insurance claims for damages, so the properties are not going to suffer that much, realistically, with insurance companies doing what they do,” said Andre Locker, 44. Locker called the mayor’s comments a “cop-out,” adding that if people are being treated right by a system, they won’t destroy that system’s infrastructure. Online complaints about vandalism at protests has been met with pushback, saying that property destruction does not delegitimize unrest. “Stop complaining about ‘riots,’” read a tweet by @EliErlick that received 351,000 likes and 99.2 thousand retweets. “Riots gave you 8-hour workdays, gay rights and free speech.” A Facebook post from a sympathetic restaurant owner in Minneapolis has also been circulated widely. Gandhi Mahal Restaurant burned down during morning protests on Friday, but its owner Ruhel Islam has been quoted as saying, “Let the buildings burn. Justice needs to be served. Put those officers in jail.” Some Louisville’s protesters were unsure Friday whether extreme protests could help achieve their goals. Hines said that conducting a peaceful protest is important because it would prevent detractors from diminishing protesters’ concerns. “You have to have peace so you can be heard,” she said, “because if not, the president will tweet dumb things like he did, instead of looking at the real issue.” But, after Thursday’s protest, with its singed picnic tables and defensive officers, Fischer announced that no-knock warrants would be temporarily suspended in Louisville, one of the protesters’ demands. De Vries said, “Change has always happened because people did get out in the streets as one of the strategies. Because people in power have never just decided out of the goodness of their hearts that they’re going to make those changes. It’s always come about because of grassroots movements, pressuring on many levels.”",0.0

Even as they halted traffic on the Capital Beltway and shouted obscenities at the fleet of presidential helicopters that carried Trump back to the White House, the demonstrations scattered throughout the city remained mostly peaceful. But there were also signs of increased tension as the protesters sought to call attention to the killing of Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee. Some threw bottles at Secret Service agents and police near the White House. Officers respondedby firing tear gasto break up the crowds. The D.C. National Guard joined other armored forces in Lafayette Square, near the White House, in trying to control protesters. “Don’t run! Don’t run!” some yelled as police and protesters clashed outside the park Saturday night. Showing at least five red welts on her bare left arm, Lindsay Kouyate, 21, said she was shot with something she couldn't identify. Kouyate said she was holding her ""I Cant Breathe"" sign near the police in front of Lafayette Square at the time. ""I was just standing there with my sign. A bunch of other people were yelling and screaming,” she said. ""He shot me so many times. I don’t know what it was."" Kouyate, who lives in Maryland, said she had been at the protests all day but wasn’t going home, even after her injury. More:Joe Biden on George Floyd protests: 'We must not allow this pain to destroy us' ""You have to keep protesting,"" she said, ""otherwise it won’t ever stop."" Nour Faladi, a 22-year-old programmer from Maryland, was among those caught in a round of tear gas. She was in a crowd when a gas canister hit the ground, she said, and it was “immediately harder to breathe."" She said her eyes started running. She said a volunteer in the crowd washed her eyes out, and then she headed back into the crowd. Police wearing helmets and holding shields formed a line between the protesters and the White House, a hot spot in the city throughout much of Saturday evening. At times, some protesters tried to knock over temporary barriers or approach officers, although none appeared to get near the tall fence at the White House. At least one vehicle was on fire a few blocks north of the White House, and firefighters also responded to an alley fire near the White House. A local TV station reported that stores in the city's tony Georgetown neighborhood had boarded windows. ""Multiple"" special agents and uniformed officers were injured when some protesters threw bricks, rocks, bottles and fireworks at officers, officials said. Trump attended the historic SpaceX rocket launch in Florida earlier Saturday and returned to the White House on Marine One at around 8:30 p.m.As the presidential helicopters buzzed overhear near the White House grounds, some demonstrators shouted obscenities and shook their fists. Trump used his address at the Kennedy Space Center to offer a stern warning to ""rioters, looters and anarchists"" against violence. ""My administration will stop mob violence and we’ll stop it cold,"" Trump said, blaming violence in several cities on ""radical left-wing"" groups. ""I will not allow angry mobs to dominate...It is essential that we protect the crown jewel of democracy: The rule of law."" The unrest in Washington came as protests erupted in cities across the nation against police brutality and racial discrimination. At least two deaths have been linked to the demonstrations. Protesters set cars on fire, smashed windows and clashed with police officers dressed in riot gear in Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Portland, Oregon; and elsewhere. Attorney General Barr:Peaceful protests over George Floyd 'hijacked' by 'far left extremist groups' Outside the White House, officers wearing plastic body shields charged and pushed back a crowd of people who had removed metal barriers set up on Pennsylvania Avenue. A police helicopter circled overhead. The smell of marijuana also hung in the air. ""Trump is the reason why cops feel they can do certain things to black people,” said Cameron Jackson, 25, a supervisor at a grocery store, as he stood in the middle of 16th Street. “He condones it. He is a racist.” But Jackson said heopposed violence. ""I'm peaceful,"" he said. ""I'm away from the violence."" Dave Pringle, 32, who works on criminal justice policy in D.C., also condemned Trump. ""This man – this occupant of this building – represents the worst of humanity,"" Pringle said. ""I think he is an avatar of the worst of humanity."" Six people were arrested near Lafayette Square on Friday and early Saturday, according to the Secret Service, which said it ""respects the right to assemble, and we ask that individuals do so peacefully for the safety of all."" Secret Service agents and police carrying shields blocked off Lafayette Square north of the White House as drivers honked in support of the protesters and raised their fists in the air. Some demonstrators held up signs that read: ""Stop Murdering Black People"" and ""White Silence is Violence."" ""I came here to enforce the Black Lives Matter movement and to get justice for the injustices we have been receiving for over hundreds of years,"" said Ariel Weems, a 16-year-old high school student from Bowie, Maryland. She called Trump part of the problem. “I don’t agree with any of his policies,"" Weems said. ""His Twitter comments? Shooting and looting? That was absurd. ... We’re out here protesting for our lives.” In the heat of the afternoon, some moved through the crowds, passing out water bottles. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, others distributed masks. Most of the demonstrators wore masks but were closer than six feet from each other. Strumming a guitar, Steve Canciani, 28, sang the Christian song “Break Every Chain” with Daniel Faludi, 22, near the White House. Their music mixed with the sound of sirens and the whirring of a circling helicopter. ""God always has a solution,"" Canciani said. Jake Schindler, 26, was one of several people handing out water. Schindler said his Christian faith ""called him"" to justice. After running by the protest earlier in the afternoon and seeing others giving out water, he came back with a case of bottles to distribute. James Bryant, a 30-year-old Washington resident, said he felt “like he needed to show up as a black man in America.” The protests, he said, were part of a “collective anger” that Americans can't ignore. Asked if he was worried about tensions between the crowd and the cordon of police, he shrugged and said, “they’re just people.” By early evening, some protesters marched to the National Museum of African American History and Culture near the Washington Monument. Along the route, someone painteda Wells Fargo bank branch with the words ""capitalism is murder."" Others paintedreferences to the police and to Floyd on the ground. Bowser and Trump:DC Mayor Bowser responds to Trump's criticism over police after George Floyd protests Corey Gwynn, a 27-year-old speech pathologist from Virginia, told USA TODAY she had joined the protest because she was ""upset about the lack of equality,"" especially as people had peacefully protested for so long ""with no change."" Asked what she thought of the protests around the country, some of which turned violent, she said she ""can’t blame her brothers and sisters, but that’s not the way I’m going about it."" ""Merchandise can be replaced, but black lives can’t, she said. Floyd, 46, died Monday evening, shortly after video footage showed him handcuffed, gasping for air and saying ""I can't breathe,"" as a white officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. The video, taken by a bystander, circulated online and prompted widespread protests nationwide. Who was George Floyd? George Floyd remembered as 'gentle giant' as family calls his death 'murder' George Floyd death'Why can't I just be black in the state of Minnesota?' The Minneapolis Police Department fired four officers involved in the incident while state and federal authorities have launched investigations into the matter. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was seen kneeling on Floyd's neck, was arrested Friday and is facing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Subsequent charges are possible and charges for the other officers involved are anticipated, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said. But those actions have done little to quell the anger many feel. Sherese Teixeira, 33, posed for a photo in front of graffiti sprayed on the side of a building near the White House that read: “Why do we keep having to tell you that black lives matter?” ""It’s been going on too long,” Teixeira said.

Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin is charged with third degree murder, but they are continuing to review evidence and there may be subsequent charges later. The manslaughter charge is second degree. Freeman said they focused on the ""most dangerous"" perpetrator first, but the other three officers involved in Floyd's arrest are under investigation and he anticipates charges against them as well. The criminal complaint states that Chauvin was the officer seen on video with his knee on Floyd's neck while Floyd was pleading, ""I can't breathe."" ""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer,"" Freeman said, referring to the video as ""horrible, horrific, terrible."" He said that in addition to that bystander video, they have officers' body-worn cameras, witness statements, the preliminary Medical Examiner's report, and expert opinions as evidence. ""Normally these cases take nine months to a year,"" Freeman said. ""We have to charge these cases very carefully because we have the difficult burden of proof."" When asked whether public unrest factored into the speed, Freeman said, ""I’m not insensitive to what’s happened in the streets."" But he maintained that his job is to charge when his office has ""sufficient evidence."" ""I will not allow us to charge a case before it is ready,"" Freeman said. ""This case is now ready, and we have charged it."" Freeman said that the charges are the same ones levied against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in the death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond. According to the criminal complaint in the Floyd case, two officers responded to a report of someone using a counterfeit $20 bill at the Cup Foods on 37th and Chicago Avenue. Officers Thomas Lane and J.A. Kueng were told the man was sitting in a car parked around the corner, on 38th Street. The complaint says Lane began speaking with Floyd, who was in the driver's seat of the car, and then pulled his gun and told Floyd to show his hands. When Floyd put his hands on the steering wheel, Lane put his gun back. According to the complaint, Lane ordered Floyd out of the car, then pulled him out and handcuffed him. Floyd ""actively resisted being handcuffed,"" but then became compliant and sat on the sidewalk at Lane's direction. The attorney's office says in the complaint that Floyd and Lang had a conversation for just under two minutes, and then both officers stood Floyd up and tried to walk him to their squad. At that point, the charges state that Floyd ""stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic."" That's when officers Derek Chauvin and Tou Thoa arrived as backup. They made ""several attempts"" to get Floyd into the backseat of the car and ""Floyd did not voluntarily get in the car and struggled with the officers by intentionally falling down, saying he was not going int the car, and refusing to stand still,"" the complaint says. According to the complaint, Floyd said he could not breathe while he was standing up, and began repeating it. The complaint says officers tried to get Floyd into the car from the passenger side, and and at 8:19 p.m. Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the car. ""Mr. Floyd went to the ground face down and still handcuffed,"" the complaint narrative then reads. ""Kueng held Mr. Floyd’s back and Lane held his legs. The defendant placed his left knee in the area of Mr. Floyd’s head and neck. Mr. Floyd said, 'I can’t breathe' multiple times and repeatedly said, 'Mama' and 'please,' as well. The defendant and the other two officers stayed in their positions."" According to the complaint, the officers told Floyd, ""you are talking fine."" Lane asked if they should roll him on his side, and Chauvin said, ""No, staying put where we got him."" The complaint says that Lane asked again, ""I am worried about excited delirium or whatever,"" and Chauvin said, ""That's why we have him on his stomach."" ""None of the three officers moved from their positions,"" the complaint says. The body-worn camera footage investigators examined showed that Floyd stopped moving at 8:24:24, and stopped breathing or speaking at 8:25:31. Kueng checked Floyd's wrist for a pulse and said ""I couldn't find one,"" but none of the officers moved until 8:27:24, when Chauvin removed his knee from Floyd's neck, according to the complaint. The autopsy report is pending but preliminary findings show that Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. ""The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death,"" the report says, with no evidence of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation. Prosecutors ended the criminal complaint by saying, ""The defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive. Police are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous."" In a letter to Gov. Walz Friday afternoon, the Minneapolis Delegation requested that the case be handled by the Attorney General's Office rather than the Hennepin County Attorney. The letter, which was written in collaboration by Representatives Fue Lee (59A), Raymond Dehn (59B), Sydney Jordan (60A), Mohamud Noor (60B), Frank Hornstein (61A), Jamie Long (61B), Hodan Hassan (62A), Aisha Gomez (62B), Jim Davnie (63A), Jean Wagenius (63B), reads: We are writing to request that the case against the police officers who killed George Floyd, or may have been otherwise culpable in his death, be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Attorney General's office. Unfortunately, our constituents, especially constituents of color, have lost faith in the ability of Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to fairly and impartially investigate and prosecute these cases. Freeman's press conference on May 28th, in which he seemed ill-prepared and suggested that there was unseen exculpatory evidence that might exonerate the officers, further ruptured this trust. Given the present circumstances, we believe that this case should be handled in a way that maximizes public trust and gives confidence to the public that justice will be done. Under the circumstances, transferring the case to the Attorney General's office would be one of the most decisive actions that you could take to calm public anger and guarantee a fair process. Attorney General Ellison has earned goodwill of Minneapolis residents through years of service to the city, and is known and respected throughout the community. It is imperative to signal to our constituents, as strongly and quickly as possible, that the authorities are treating this case with the special attention it deserves, and to demonstrate that all Minnesotans are equal in the eyes of the law. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey issued a statement in response to the charges Friday, saying, ""We are a nation at a crossroad, and today’s decision from the County Attorney is an essential first step on a longer road toward justice and healing our city."" “What’s happened in Minneapolis is bigger than any one city and any single event,” said Frey. “For our Black community who have, for centuries, been forced to endure injustice in a world simply unwilling to correct or acknowledge it: I know that whatever hope you feel today is tempered with skepticism and a righteous outrage."" Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington announced earlier Friday during a different news conference that Chauvin had been arrested. The BCA confirms that he was taken into custody at 11:44 a.m. Friday in Minneapolis. Meanwhile, Governor Tim Walz held a news conference at 10:30 a.m. after another night of violence and looting in Minneapolis and St. Paul, as protests over the death of George Floyd devolved into riots. Walz said he received a call from State Sen. Patricia Torres Ray Thursday that District 63 was burning, and there were no police officers or Minnesota National Guard troops to help. “That is an abject failure that cannot happen,"" Walz said. ""We must restore that order.” Harrington said that national guard troops were called in to help Thursday, but they did not receive a “specific mission” to help clear the streets until midnight, on a call with the mayor. Harrington said Minneapolis Mayor Frey informed them they had ""no more resources"" and they were not able to meet public safety needs on Lake Street. ""When the Third Precinct was abandoned, it seemed that that was the time to move,"" Gov. Walz said. They then had to get a plan together, Harrington said. By the time they brought state patrol, Minnesota National Guard, and other assisting crews to Lake Street, he said it was 3 a.m. They arrested some people at that time and for other looting incidents throughout the day, Harrington said, but he did not have numbers on how many. He said most people left peacefully. Harrington said the people who were out at that hour were not the people of Minneapolis “who are still having their guts ripped out about the Floyd murder.” “I don’t want to prejudice this,” he said regarding using the term “murder.” “I’m just calling it like I see it.” “I can tell you that no one could have heard Mr. Floyd’s voice in the chaos of the screaming and the shouting and the fires at 1 o’clock in the morning on Lake Street,” he said. “My job is to make sure the community is safe and the team is ready and prepared to keep it safe.” Harrington said his team, including the national guard, state troopers and DNR, is confident that they can make a plan to keep people safe Friday night while protecting First Amendment rights to protest. “We will create a plan that will keep the peace, maintain the peace, and prevent further lawless behavior in the city of Minneapolis, the city of St. Paul and surrounding suburbs,” he said. The governor acknowledged that the ""tools"" needed to restore order, including the Minnesota National Guard, are ""the very same tools that have led to that grief and pain."" Those national guard troops are armed, officials confirmed Friday, and maintain the right to defend themselves, though they would not comment further on the boundaries around their use of force. ""I’m asking you to help us. Help us use a humane way to get the streets to a place where we can restore the justice,"" he said. ""So those who are demanding justice can be heard. Not those who throw fire bombs into businesses."" Walz said that he has spoken with Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman and he is confident that ""justice will be swift, that it will come in a timely manner, and that it will be fair."" ""You're seeing holes in planning,"" Walz said, ""that's for dang sure."" He said Minnesotans can expect to hear what the plan is for Friday night by 2 p.m. ""Tonight needs to be different,"" Walz said. He promised that state troops would step into the gap. State Attorney General Keith Ellison quoted Martin Luther King, Jr., when he asked Minnesotans not to disregard riots as only senseless violence. ""Ask yourself, what’s going on there?"" he said. ""And is it something that we as a society absolutely must pay attention to? I think we must pay attention."" Ellison pointed out that as Minnesota National Guard troops are deployed to maintain order, they are the same people who were administering COVID-19 tests across the state last week. ""Don’t react to them the way you might react to the Minneapolis Police Department,"" he said. ""It’s not the same group. They have different leadership, different authority, and their job is to try to bring peace and calm back again. Please remember that this is not the group you associate with unfair conduct."" Walz said Friday that he believes the public has ""lost faith"" in the Minneapolis Police Department. The state's response came as businesses and homes continued to burn Thursday night and Friday morning. Just after 10:30 p.m., a crowd stormed the building housing the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct, setting it on fire. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey held a press conference just after 1 a.m. to address the continued unrest across the city. Frey said rioting posed an imminent threat to the safety of the officers and staffers within MPD's Third Precinct, forcing him to make the decision to evacuate the compound. “Symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life or the public,” Frey said. “We could not risk serious injury to anyone… brick and mortar is not as important as life.” However, he went on to say that progress during this crisis would not come from the government alone. “We additionally need help from the community. We need to make sure that people are looking out for our city right now. It's not just enough to do the right thing for yourself. We need to make sure that all of us are upholding the ideals that we stand by.” Although the mayor acknowledged the pain and frustration in recent days, he made it clear, the devastation is unacceptable. “What we have seen over the past couple of nights in terms of looting is unacceptable. These are businesses. These are community institutions that we need. These are banks that people rely on to get cash, grocery stores that people rely on to get food … We need to ensure that they are protected.” In St. Paul, fires burned in buildings across the street from Allianz Field. According to a post from the Saint Paul Police Department, more than 170 businesses have been damaged or looted along with dozens of fires. President Trump also weighed in on Twitter late Thursday night, blaming the emergent social disturbance on a lack of local leadership, and threatened to send in the federal National Guard unless the city was brought under control. The president went on to tweet, ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"" Twitter has since removed a portion of the president's tweet, citing violations of their user policy for glorifying violence.",0.0

""Looting leads to shooting, and that's why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot,"" Trump tweeted Friday afternoon. ""I don't want this to happen, and that's what the expression put out last night means."" ""It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,"" the president added in a follow-up tweet. ""It's very simple, nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters, and those looking to cause trouble on social media. Honor the memory of George Floyd!"" Looting leads to shooting, and that’s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2020 Louisville police did not report any looting during the Thursday night protests, though several people were arrested in connection with damage to property and vehicles. ""We did not see looting last night,"" Louisville Metro Police spokeswoman Jessie Halladay told The Courier Journal on Friday. ""I don’t know if any reports may have been filed today by businesses reporting any thefts, but in the way looting is generally considered, we did not see that last night."" The death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer in Minneapolis pinned him to the ground under his knee on Memorial Day, has resulted in protests and anger not only in Minneapolis but in other cities around the country. The Minneapolis protests have also featured damage and fires at numerous business and a police building. The chaotic scenes in Minneapolis resulted in Trump tweeting just before 1 a.m. Friday that he could not ""stand back & watch this happen to a great American City."" ""These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” Trump tweeted, adding that he had spoken to Gov. Tim Walz and told him that ""the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" That phrase at the end of Trump's tweet was first used by Miami Police Chief Walter Hedley in 1967, who threatened a crackdown on ""hoodlums"" he said were taking advantage of the civil rights movement. The tweet prompted also Twitter to slap a warning on the pair of Trump's tweets, cautioning users that it violated its policies by glorifying violence. So the Republican president followed up with Friday tweet that mentioned the seven shot and wounded during Thursday night's protest in downtown Louisville over the March death of Taylor. Louisville police say they are still searching for the shooter or shooters, adding that no officers fired their weapons at the protest. Taylor, a 26-year-old ER tech, was fatally shot in March by Louisville Metro Police officers serving a narcotics-related warrant at her apartment. No drugs were found in Taylor's apartment following the deadly encounter, and protests, lawsuits as well as independent investigations have since resulted in regards to the actions of the involved LMPD officers.

In the aftermath of a third night of protests that took place Saturday over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, several demonstrations have popped up across Louisville on Sunday, and city officials have released more information about what's taken place over the weekend. Here's what's happening around the city. • 10:45 p.m. — In a media briefing, Mayor Greg Fischer called for a ""day of reflection"" on Monday, as Sunday night protests began to taper off. Fischer said local faith leaders would have a virtual call on Facebook Live at 11:30 a.m. Monday to mourn those who have died in the coronavirus pandemic -- ""that's one of my worries about all these people being together,"" Fischer added. LMPD Lt. Colonel LaVita Chavous took the mic afterward and said more than 40 arrests have taken place after a peaceful protest earlier turned unlawful. She added that ""anarchists"" had ""infiltrated"" the crowd as well, and they were using the peaceful protest for their own purposes. Chavous said the peaceful protest at Jefferson Square Park was unlawful, as it took place without a permit, which led to officers breaking it up before curfew. The officer who fired pepper balls at a WAVE 3 crew on Friday, meanwhile, is being investigated and will be reassigned in the meantime, Chavous said. • 10:30 p.m. — Louisville police have addressed an allegation reported by WDRB from Metro Council President David James that protesters were fired upon because they were carrying leaf blowers with bleach to shoot at police. Six or so protesters were arrested minutes earlier near Broadway and Brook Street, while other arrests have taken place in the meantime. An estimated crowd of 1,000 had gathered earlier before sunset at Jefferson Square Park. That group split up, though, after being confronted by police. LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay, meanwhile, said while they had not confirmed protesters were carrying leaf blowers with the intent to harm police, they had seen demonstrators carrying them in the crowd. ""We saw people with leaf blowers in the crowd,"" Hallday told The Courier Journal's Sarah Ladd. ""We know those are used for things like dispensing powder chemicals and for blowing gas back toward police. We don’t have any confirmation they were used for either purpose. The threat of that use is one reason we decided to disperse the crowd prior to curfew."" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer will address media at 10:45 p.m. for a Sunday night update. • 10:15 p.m. — Police arrested around six demonstrators near Broadway and Brook Street. Louisville's curfew went into effect at 9 p.m., though police fired tear gas at protesters at Jefferson Square Park before that deadline. Last night, Mayor Greg Fischer said 40-50 people were arrested during the protests. • 9:45 p.m — Broadway was completely blocked at First Street just before 9:45 p.m. Protesters have been scattered around downtown since being split up from a meeting point at Jefferson Square Park at around 8:20 p.m. A large police presence has come to a standstill by the gas station at First Street, with a lot of police vehicles on and helicopters in the air. • 9:30 p.m — Jefferson Square Park is packed with law enforcement officials at sundown, and protesters on Broadway were met with pepper balls and tear gas, according to Courier Journal and USA TODAY reporters Darcy Costello and Natalie Alund. The crowd was heading toward the Highlands, where another large protest took place Saturday night. Tear gas is in the air, Costello said – you can feel it in your throat. Police are using vans to rapidly redeploy across the city to reach different groups of protesters. • 9 p.m — We've hit curfew in Louisville. About 1,000 protesters who rallied earlier in the evening split up after being confronted by police at around 8:15 p.m. A large police presence was by the Brown Hotel on Broadway at 9 p.m. cars honked and the sun continued to set. Car protests have been common throughout the weekend protests. • 8:45 p.m — Citing an anti-riot statute, police have taken steps early Sunday night to break up protests, even before the 9 p.m. curfew. Tear gas and flash bangs scattered crowds at Jefferson Square Park, according to Courier Journal reporter Darcy Costello, as some protesters dispersed toward Fourth Street, which has taken heavy damage amid three previous nights of demonstrations, and others spread to other pockets of downtown Louisville. Officers have cleared out Jefferson Square Park. pic.twitter.com/behNAcEglB — Darcy Costello (@dctello) June 1, 2020 Law enforcement members in full camo took their place on some downtown streets leading up to and during the confrontation. National Guard members had been called in by officials to assist after Friday's protests, while Kentucky State Police officers are also alongside Louisville Metro Police officers. • 8:20 p.m. — Protesters were told by a speaker with a megaphone to take children home just before 8 p.m., and 10 minutes later police announced that the demonstration was an ""unlawful assembly,"" though Louisville's curfew was not scheduled to begin until 9 p.m. The person with the megaphone told the crowd that tear gas and flash bangs would be fired, causing some to leave the scene. At 8:19 p.m., police followed through, firing flash bangs and tear gas into the crowd at Jefferson Square Park. • 7:45 p.m. — Protesters took to the street on Broadway and raised their fists as police officers looked on at around 7:30 p.m. Sunday, according to Courier Journal reporter Darcy Costello. The group, which numbered in the hundreds, knelt in front of Metro Corrections minutes later. The number of protesters is high Sunday night, those in the field say. Another group has gathered at Sixth and Liberty streets, where officers destroyed protesters' milk jugs and water bottles a night earlier. Meanwhile, a MetroSafe supervisor said one person was taken to the hospital with life-threatening injuries after having being shot at Seventh and Hill streets, according to Courier Journal reporter Sarah Ladd. It's unknown if the shooting is related to the protest. • 7 p.m. — By around 7 p.m, an estimated crowd of 1,000 had gathered on Broadway and Roy Wilkins, filling all six lanes of Roy Wilkins, to demand justice for Breonna Taylor. • 6 p.m. — Mayor Greg Fischer said Monday will be designated as a ""Day of Reflection"" to reflect on what needs to change to combat racism in the city. There will be a virtual gathering on Facebook Live at 11:30 a.m. The day will also honor the people from Louisville who have died from the coronavirus. Here's a quick look at what you may have missed earlier Sunday. • Around 40 people were arrested at Saturday night's protests, according to Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, as the National Guard was called in to assist. Saturday was the first day a 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. curfew was in effect — the curfew also applies Sunday night and will be reevaluated on Monday. • A number of maximum security inmates broke an interior dormitory window overnight at the jail, according to a Metro Corrections release, and they damaged some property in the jail before the disturbance was quelled. Four suffered minor injuries. None of the inmates involved were arrested at the weekend protests, the release said. • While volunteers downtown cleaned up, more demonstrations took place around town Sunday afternoon, including one notable gathering in St. Matthews and an address by local pastors at 13th Street and Broadway. • A police cruiser was hit by at least one bullet on Saturday night, Fischer said Sunday. The car was near Ninth and Broadway. Three officers were inside and no one was injured. From Saturday night A third night of protests erupted in Louisville on Saturday, with a heavier police presence taking to the streets to match the local demonstrators. The demonstrations are part of a national movement and in Louisville have taken place over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, an African American who was unarmed when police executed a ""no-knock"" search warrant at her apartment and returned fire when her boyfriend fired on them. He has said he thought they were intruders. Livestream: Third night of Breonna Taylor protests in Louisville. Watch the footage While much of what's occurred at the two protests has been peaceful, Thursday night's demonstration was marred by a shooting that injured seven people and Friday night saw looting and widespread damage throughout downtown as police fired tear gas at several groups. On Saturday, Mayor Greg Fischer and Gov. Andy Beshear called for the National Guard to assists in the city, and the added police presence was felt -- looting and major property damage did not appear to be an issue, though officers and protesters clashed throughout the night in the Highlands and downtown. The Courier Journal had reporters and photographers around the city to cover Saturday's protests in real time. Here's a look back at what happened. • 2 a.m. – A busy night across Louisville appeared to be slowing to a halt in the early hours of Sunday morning. Two people were injured in a shooting just after 11 p.m., police said, but it did not appear to have been associated with the protest. And the noise in the Highlands and in downtown Louisville had tapered off a bit as the night's demonstrations ended. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer addressed media members at 10:30 p.m. and tweeted around midnight a statement thanking those who had peacefully protested. Still, Saturday's protests were not unique to Louisville. Minnesota was a hotbed once again, but demonstrations in New York, Los Angeles (where around 500 arrests took place), Nashville, Cincinnati, Lexington and other notable metropolitan areas continued to rock the nation. • 1 a.m. – Protests had dwindled in some areas as we entered Sunday morning, but some demonstrators kept at it. A large number of officers were at the gas station at First Street and Broadway, according to The Courier Journal's Matt Glowicki, as protesters continued to make their presence known. Broadway was loud for much of the night, as cars of protesters laid on their horns to make a statement. • 12:30 a.m. – A fire broke out earlier in the evening at the McDonald's restaurant at Second Street and Broadway but had been mostly contained by 12:30 a.m. The scene on Broadway, though, was hectic, according to Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin, as a group of protesters moved through the area and were followed by police. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, meanwhile, issued a statement on Twitter thanking those who kept their cool throughout the night. ""Thanks to all who’ve abided by the curfew,"" Fischer wrote. ""I am gratified to say that the majority of people are staying home. I want to thank all those who came out tonight and protested peacefully, expressing your concerns about the tragic death of Breonna Taylor."" • Midnight – The scene had cleared significantly at Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue at midnight, with officers taking a quick snack break after using gas and what appeared to be pellet guns to clear a group of protesters at the high-profile Louisville intersection. Back in the heart of the city, near Fourth and Guthrie streets, the owner of escape room Locked In stood out front of his business with a rifle to keep back protesters after the establishment's glass door had been shattered earlier. A caravan of law enforcement vehicles traveled in front of it down the street. Micheal Snyder guards the Escape Game on Fourth Street where looters threw rocks through the door. He plans to guard it all night with his AR-15. pic.twitter.com/weuEItBbTv — Natalie Neysa Alund (@nataliealund) May 31, 2020 Meanwhile one person was taken to the hospital Saturday night after being shot on Clay Street, according to a MetroSafe supervisor. The shooting was reported at 11:05 p.m. No other information was immediately available. • 11:30 p.m. – Many protesters left the corner of Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue and others were pushed further back at 11:20 p.m. by launching some kind of gas toward the crowd, which had gathered peacefully well after the 9 p.m. curfew. Police fired pepper ball guns at those who stayed at the scene, as Courier Journal reporter Matt Glowicki broadcast live on Facebook. Near the hospitals on Floyd Street, meanwhile, a crowd kept moving with police following them, The Courier Journal's Billy Kobin reported. The two sides had not physically clashed. Kobin said dozens of cars were in the crowd, with six police vehicles following. • 11 p.m. – The scene is tense in the Highlands. Armored trucks and a large police presence have taken the corner of Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue. Police fired pepper balls and what seemed to be pepper spray at protesters after someone in the crowd threw a water bottle at the officers, The Courier Journal's Olivia Krauth reported. Traffic has been blocked off at the intersection. Courier Journal reporter Matt Glowicki has footage from the scene. Police and protesters were still on the streets downtown as well. Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin reported a large crowd moving down Broadway, with police in the area as well. • 10:45 p.m. – In a 10:30 p.m. press briefing, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said the situation on the streets was ""still evolving"" and he hoped Sunday Louisville could come together peacefully and set an example for the rest of the country. Tear gas has been deployed, Fischer said, and about 10 people have been arrested, though a Metro Corrections spokesman said earlier that number was higher. The mayor also defended officers who destroyed water bottles and milk gallons that belonged to protesters, saying flammable liquids and other hazardous materials had been placed with the water and milk. Those materials needed to • 10:15 p.m. – Metro Corrections spokesman Tracy Dotson told The Courier Journal at least 25 to 30 arrests have taken place Saturday night, a much higher number than had occurred in the previous two nights of protests. Meanwhile, the scene had cleared near Sixth and Main streets, The Courier Journal's Billy Kobin reported, while separate groups of protesters marched in other areas downtown and in NuLu and the Highlands. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer will address reporters at 10:30 p.m., his office said. • 10 p.m. – Police have fired tear gas into the crowd at Jefferson Square. At least one protester was seen being detained on Sixth Street. Mounted police were showing up near the Republic Bank building downtown. Meanwhile, there was a throng of protesters at Bardstown Road and Baxter Avenue. Police were staged at a nearby Walgreens. SWAT officers were seen gathering near Baxter and Broadway. • 9:30 p.m. – Protesters in the Highlands have continued to try to make their point, even as National Guard personnel move into the region. Much of the crowd congregated near Bardstown Road and Grinstead Drive. Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth said many protesters stopped at the Wendy's near that corner and would not go past a National Guard truck that was in the parking lot. Down the street outside Cave Hill Cemetery, Courier Journal reporter Matt Glowicki spoke with Tracy Grizzle and her daughter Abby. They live in the Highlands and came out with signs to show support. She said the protest had been peaceful. ""They're telling us to leave, so we're trying to follow the rules,"" she said, as cars passed them and honked in support. ""All it is is we're trying to get our message out."" • 9:15 p.m. – Police have deployed tear gas downtown in various areas, including outside the judicial center, as Saturday night's protests get hotter. Law enforcement officials had previously smashed milk jugs and water bottle belonging to protesters downtown earlier in the day. The officers continued to work to break up groups of protesters around Jefferson Square. Charles Booker, who is running for the Democratic nomination to run for Mitch McConnell's Senate seat in November, shared a video of police breaking up protesters with green gas well before 9 p.m. • 9 p.m. – The crowd on Sixth Street was sparse at 9 p.m., when the Saturday night curfew was set to take place. Moments earlier, Courier Journal photojournalist Pat McDonogh said, police had broken up a crowd in the area. Protesters were spread widely at Sixth and Jefferson streets in the aftermath. The Highlands protest, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth, began to splinter around 9 p.m., after a group leader said the National Guard was blocks away. • 8:45 p.m. – Groups of protesters have once again taken to different areas in the city. Protesters on Liberty Street began to flee toward sunset after a few flashbangs when off in the area around 8:30 p.m. That's happened a few times tonight, according to Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin. Along Bardstown Road, according to The Courier Journal's Olivia Krauth, a march was taking place that was mostly peaceful. The group blocked the intersection of Baxter Avenue and Broadway to get their message across. That group of protesters, Courier Journal photojournalist Michael Clevenger said, has bounced around the region quite a bit. • 8:15 p.m. — The crowd of protesters outside Metro Hall is separating. State police have deployed green smoke and pepper balls. State police warned protesters over a speaker to peacefully disperse and warned that they may dispense ""chemical agents for unlawful assembly."" The curfew officially begins at 9 p.m. • 8 p.m. – State police and LMPD are advancing toward protests outside police headquarters and the Hall of Justice at Seventh and Jefferson streets. Meanwhile, police have blocked off Bardstown Road at Lucia, just west of Mid City Mall. • 7:40 p.m. – Law enforcement officers are taking away protesters' stockpiles of water and milk at Jefferson Square. A Ford pickup pulled up on the sidewalk, and plainclothes police officers began throwing the cases of water into the back of the truck and discarding the milk, which protesters use to combat the effects of tear gas. Officers in the area have put on their gas masks. I cannot believe what I just witnessed. They pulled up onto the square with a police siren on and did this. #Louisvillepic.twitter.com/65o2lgZCJh — Natalie Neysa Alund (@nataliealund) May 30, 2020 • 7 p.m. – A crowd of about 100 protesters at Broadway and Baxter Avenue had gathered and were making their way toward the Highlands just after 7 p.m. At Sixth and Jefferson streets in downtown Lousiville, meanwhile, where the most heated moments of Thursday's protest took place, a crowd of 250 or so people had arrived from Sixth Street, chanting and blocking some cars in the area. • 6:45 p.m. – A group of protesters from Louisville blocked the Second Street Bridge into Southern Indiana. About 400 demonstrators who had marched to the bridge next to the Yum Center from Jefferson Square stood across the roadway, turning cars away to head back north to the Hoosier State. The protesters left the bridge about 15 minutes later. • 6:30 p.m. – In a sitdown interview with The Courier Journal, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer asked protesters to make their feelings known before the 9 p.m. curfew hits Saturday night. A lot of people are upset right now, Fischer said, and that's ""totally understandable."" But the tone of the protests turned Friday night, he said, and the property damage and ""anarchic element"" that came to the forefront later in the evening led to an escalation that did not need to continue on Saturday. Fischer, who said he'd been on a call with 30 other mayors earlier in the day, had brought in the National Guard earlier to assist with Saturday's protest. Systematic change is needed, he said, but ""we don't want a further escalation tonight that could potentially endanger more people. Check out more from the interview below. CLOSE Mayor Greg Fischer talked about deploying the National Guard and other decisions made after two nights of protests over the death of Breonna Taylor. Louisville Courier Journal • 5:45 p.m. – A small protest in Jeffersonville, Indiana brought together demonstrators at the Big Four Bridge. Those in attendance want the Indiana State Police to release body cam footage taken on the night Malcolm Williams was shot and killed in April by a trooper, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth. And there were some tense moments. The group ran into a crowd of hecklers on the patio of Parlour Pizza, along with some families who left amid the commotion. Things ratcheted up a notch at one point when a man from the patio got on a motorcycle and tried to leave by driving through the crowd on a two-way street. Police were blocking streets with their cars on a rolling basis as protesters moved along but did not appear to have much of a presence on foot. In Jeffersonville, Indiana, a small protest against police brutality is at the bottom of the Big Four bridge. pic.twitter.com/Ow7nVi0cue — Olivia Krauth (@oliviakrauth) May 30, 2020 Meanwhile, here's some background from earlier on Saturday. • Mayor Greg Fischer issued an executive order in the morning putting a curfew in effect through the weekend. The curfew begins at 9 p.m. Saturday and Sunday and ends at 6:30 a.m. Sunday and Monday, and excludes people traveling for work, worship or for medical purposes. Those who violate the order could be cited and will be asked to return home. • About 350 National Guard members from Kentucky will be in Louisville on Saturday in response to the previous nights' protests, Fischer and Gov. Andy Beshear announced. • All TARC Louisville bus services will be suspended at 7 p.m. Saturday, the organization announced earlier in the afternoon, but routes will resume on Sunday. • Louisville's EMW Women's Clinic, the only abortion clinic in Kentucky, was damaged Friday night, according to a Twitter post from an account operated by clinic escorts. Friday night highlights For the second night in a row, angry protesters crowded the streets and sidewalks of downtown Louisville – setting fires, blocking traffic, breaking windows, burning flags and protesting the March death of Breonna Taylor, the unarmed black woman killed in her apartment by Louisville police. The Courier Journal had reporters and photographers across downtown, talking to protesters, snapping photos and capturing videos while monitoring the situation. Here's a recap: • 1:15 a.m. – An angered Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer thanked police officers for showing restraint at Friday's protest, and said he hears those who protested peacefully. But the damage done to downtown businesses, he said, was unacceptable. ""This is not a protest. It is violence,"" Fischer said in a livestream just after 1 a.m. ""… No one stands up for justice and equality by smashing windows and burning property. This destruction will not be tolerated."" • 12:50 a.m. – A large numbers of officers moved toward the CVS on Fourth Street at around 12:45 a.m. Someone appeared to be hurt by the broken glass at the convenience store, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth. Traffic around the block backed up, Courier Journal reporter Matt Mencarini said, as the person who was injured was taken out on a stretcher. Some protesters appeared to leave the building, which had every glass window broken, with bottles of alcohol or other merchandise. Elsewhere, protesters looting a store at the downtown Omni Louisville Hotel were shown on WLKY. • 12:40 a.m. – The Kentucky International Convention Center sustained ""major glass and exterior damage"" during Friday's protest, according to Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles. The building was evacuated, he said, and it was far from the only building in downtown Louisville to take damage during the protest. • 12:30 a.m. – Protesters made off with one of the Gallopalooza horse statues in downtown Louisville, footage that aired on WLKY showed. Still elsewhere, the scene had cooled. At approximately 12:20 a.m., a line of law enforcement officers that had been standing shoulder-to-shoulder for hours by Metro Hall were at ease for the time. Each was given a bottle of water from a police vehicle. A handful of protesters half a block away could be seen throwing trash away and collecting pallets of unused water bottles and styrofoam coolers with jugs of milk inside to be taken away at the park at Sixth and Jefferson streets. A fire burned a block away on Seventh Street. • 12:20 a.m. – Groups of protesters were spread out in downtown Louisville, but it appeared some of the crowds had dwindled, according to Courier Journal reporters Olivia Krauth and Matt Mencarini. With broken windows and overturned plants behind them, many protesters left downtown. Police remained on Fifth Street and at one point threw tear gas at reporters and very few protesters on an otherwise silent Fourth Street. Still, some protesters, and a large police force, remained at various points throughout downtown. • 12:10 a.m. – LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said she's positive that the larger crowd at Friday's protest is because more out-of-town residents have made the trip to Louisville. Local police have been tracking social media posts throughout the day, she said, and learned of buses coming to Louisville from Indianapolis. Officers had also seen a large number of cars in the crowd with license plates from out of town. “It’s been a high-profile conversation and obviously we use a lot of intelligence about what’s occurring,” Halladay said. “With an active social media platform we can see a lot of people traveled here for this tonight.” • Midnight – Some crowds began to disperse downtown, though crowds remained in other areas, and the protest in the Highlands appeared to wind down. Protesters who had marched south down Bardstown Road, according to Courier Journal photographer Sam Upshaw Jr., stopped at Eastern Parkway and chanted before turning around. Their protest was peaceful, Upshaw and other Courier Journal reporters in the area reported. Some came close to engaging with a line of officers in front of Mid City Mall but were turned away by other protesters with megaphones urging them to move on. • 11:35 p.m. – No arrests have taken place Friday night, LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said in an update to media members at 11:30 p.m., and police do not believe any shots have been fired. When asked about a rumor circulating among protesters that police had been given authorization to use lethal force, Halladay characterized it as an attempt to incite panic in the crowd and get a reaction, though she added officers ""are always authorized to use lethal force if they are confronted with lethal force and they fear for their safety or the safety of others."" ""We have been doing what we can do to use these less lethal options of tear gas and pepper ball because they can help disperse and we wouldn’t have to use lethal force,"" she said. • 11:30 p.m. – WHAS was forced to evacuate its downtown Louisville studio Friday night amid protests in the area. The network's Senait Gebregiorgis tweeted at 11:20 p.m. that the TV crew had to leave after protesters smashed windows at the building. No one was hurt, she said. WHAS's office is at 520 W. Chestnut Street, three blocks from Jefferson Street. Glass has been broken out of the front of the WHAS building facing Chestnut Street, Courier Journal visual journalist Jeff Faughender reported. Large glass panes were broken out, other windows had holes in them. Graffiti with phrases like ""Pigs fly,"" was spray painted on the windows. Protesters, meanwhile, jumped on a WLKY TV van downtown, the network showed. • 11:25 p.m. – Footage showed at least two people break into the Eddie Merlot's steakhouse at Fourth Street Live and leave through shattered windows with bottles of alcohol. Protesters on the popular Louisville parying block also burned a Confederate flag, amid cheers. Looting had not been an issue at Thursday's protest, Louisville police confirmed Thursday afternoon. And while vandalism had been reported at several businesses around town Friday night, looting had not yet been seen as a widespread issue at the Louisville protests. CLOSE Footage obtained by The Courier Journal shows protesters entering Eddie Merlot's amid protests Friday night. May 29, 2020 Louisville Courier Journal On Fourth Street, according to Courier Journal reporter Sarah Ladd, several stores’ windows and glass doors were shattered. A large bush burned at the bottom of the Fifth Third Bank building. Hard Rock Cafe's alarm rang as shattered glass spilled into the road. • 11:15 p.m. – WAVE 3 representatives declined to comment in the immediate aftermath of an incident in which it appeared a police officer shot what looked like pepper balls from a gun at a reporter and camera operator. The Courier Journal's Tessa Duvall reached out to the station and to Louisville police in following the incident, which aired live on TV and immediately went viral. Jessie Halladay, a spokeswoman for LMPD, said at 11:30 p.m. Friday that she had reviewed the video and said it was too difficult to tell who the officer was at this time. Halladay apologized, and said, it's ""not our intention to target or subject the media as they try to cover this."" Check out the full story, with the video, here. • 11:05 p.m. – A group of protesters were working their way down Bardstown Road just after 11 p.m. amid a busy night in Louisville. The crowd appeared to be largely peaceful, as police lined the streets and a helicopter took to the air above them. Courier Journal reporter Billy Kobin said the protesters at Bardstown Road and Highland Avenue were young. They lined down the street toward the Speedway at the Grinstead Road intersection. • 11 p.m. – Fireworks were set off at the corner of Sixth and Jefferson streets moments earlier, and protests a block away at Sixth and Market had left a mark. Garbage cans that had been set on fire had melted into the street, according to Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth. A Subway and Republic Bank were vandalized, and protesters and drivers confronted one another at various points. The site hasn't hosted especially large crowds for much of the night but had seen plenty of action. A line of police, though, moved around 11 p.m. from Metro Hall toward Sixth Street. They left the scene at Sixth and Market without issue, Krauth said. On Jefferson Street at about 11 p.m., teenagers and young people walked toward advancing police in riot gear who had previously deployed tear gas, and the police then halted their advance as the situation appeared to hit a standstill. Protesters unfurled a banner that said ""This will not continue."" • 10:40 p.m. – No shots have been fired at Friday night's protest, LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay told The Courier Journal at 10:35 p.m., and no significant injuries have been reported. Two arrests have taken place. • 10:30 p.m. – In front of Metro Hall, police appear to have made an effort to split up groups of protesters. Courier Journal reporter Mandy McLaren was at the scene for an hour and reported at least 100 people were in front of the building, the site of Thursday night's confrontation, at 10:30 p.m., with officers lined shoulder-to-shoulder near Fifth and Jefferson streets to prevent two separate groups of protesters (one of at least 50 people in front of the Chase Bank, the other closer to Metro Hall) from joining together. Tear gas was dispersed minutes later, at 10:40 p.m. Tensions arose earlier in front of the Hall of Justice around sundown before that crowd moved toward Metro Hall after being dispersed by officers. • 9:45 p.m. – A lively but peaceful evening was interrupted at sundown as police shoulder-to-shoulder in riot gear with face shields, gas masks, batons and other protective gear moved protesters down Jefferson Street toward Sixth Street. The police unit rolled up just before 9:30 p.m., a half-hour after protesters at the Hall of Justice pulled down American and Kentucky flags and set them ablaze. Moments later, some protesters threw objects at the building's glass doors, more items were lit on fire and three loud bangs went off. A group of more than 1,000 people were estimated to be gathering around the Hall of Justice where everything seems to be focused. Earlier coverage from Friday Groups of protesters demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, who was an African American woman killed in her apartment by police officers on March 13, gathered in downtown Louisville. Earlier in the day, the group which was more than 500 gathered at Jefferson Street with two helicopters circling overhead, including a LMPD chopper. The groups had speakers talking from the steps of Metro Hall. The crowd has continued to grow as the evening demonstrations carried on. Hundreds also knelt between Broadway and Jefferson Street with their fists are in the air and marched around the police department chanting, 'No justice no peace.' At least one protester was against banging on the glass of the Hall of Justice steps. Protesters were also seen banging on glass at Hall of Justice steps calling for officers to come outside.

LMPD arrested and charged an Owensboro resident, 25-year-old Adair Henderson, with disorderly conduct and failure to disperse, according to an arrest citation. The offense of first-degree disorderly conduct is a Class A misdemeanor in Kentucky that is punishable by 90 days to one year in jail and a maximum $500 fine. Failure to to disperse is a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a maximum $250 fine. Stephanie Garvin and David Wheatley, both of Louisville, were also booked into Metro Corrections about 2 a.m. Friday and each charged with first-degree criminal mischief and first-degree riot, court records show. Garvin, 28, was seen by officers and captured on surveillance footage busting out the windows of a Metro Corrections van and throwing objects at the Metro Corrections building, according to her arrest citation. Wheatley, 27, was also seen breaking out the window of a Metro Corrections van and busting a window on the side of the Metro Corrections building, according to his citation. The charges of first-degree riot and first-degree criminal mischief are both Class D felonies in Kentucky, which are punishable by one to five years in prison. Louisville mayor: No-knock warrants will be suspended Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said Friday morning that five of the shooting victims from the protest are in ""good condition"" and that the two victims who required surgery are now ""stable and recovering."" The mayor also said that he is suspending the use of no-knock warrants by police and that all officers will now be required to wear body cameras while executing search warrants. Fischer said the gunfire that wounded seven people ""came from within the crowd, not from officers."" LMPD Assistant Chief of Police LaVita Chavous said LMPD has ""no leads on the shooter"" but is continuing to investigate. Two LMPD officers were also taken to the hospital with chest pains ""spurred"" by the protest, Chavous said, with one officer remaining in the hospital overnight before getting released. 'It is not a riot. It is a revolt': Councilwoman responds to Breonna Taylor protest The mayor mentioned damage to vehicles and statues. Protesters tore off the right hand of the King Louis XVI statue that stands on a pedestal at Sixth and Jefferson streets. After shots were fired in the crowd, officers deployed tear gas, pepper ball and smoke grenades ""after several verbal warnings were given ordering people to disperse,"" Washington said. ""Contrary to what you may have heard, LMPD does not utilize rubber bullets,"" Washington added. ""Pepper balls are similar to paint balls and often time leave welts on a person’s body after being struck."" Chavous would not disclose how many officers were on hand for Thursday's protest. When and where did the Thursday protest start? The gathering began as early as 6 or 7 p.m. and stretched past midnight. Crowds moved from outside City Hall on Sixth Street to in front of the KFC Yum Center, where more police officers began to engage with the crowd. As heavy rains moved into the area in the early morning hours, much of the crowd dispersed. How many protesters were there? An estimated 500 to 600 protesters gathered in the streets of downtown Louisville. The initially peaceful protest escalated as the night drew on, with the crowd being teargassed and glass storefronts shattered. By 10 p.m., at least one group could be seen verbally clashing with police officers near the Yum Center. The officers carried wooden batons and were wearing body armor and face shields. An armored truck was stationed nearby. It is unknown how many officers were called in to the protest. At one point, protesters threw things at police officers and kicked a patrol car. When one officer was surrounded by protesters near Bearno's by the Bridge, a pizza parlor near the Second Street bridge and the Yum Center, protest organizers stepped in to make sure the officer was not harmed.

May 28, 2020 (Photo: Pat McDonogh / Courier Journal) Around 11 p.m., a line of officers advanced down East Main Street, dispersing a large crowd. But not long after, hundreds congregated a few blocks south again in front of Metro Hall, where a group of protesters had been trying to tip an armored vehicle, breaking its windows and slashing its tires. Just before 11:30 p.m., multiple rounds of gunfire then rang out near Sixth and Jefferson streets. At least seven wounded victims were seen being carried away on stretchers. LMPD later confirmed that seven people had been shot and two required surgery. Who fired the shots? Who was arrested? LMPD said its officers did not fire their guns. As Chavous noted Friday morning, LMPD has ""no leads on the shooter,"" but the department's homicide unit is continuing to investigate. Apart from the Owensboro resident charged with disorderly conduct, police said several individuals were booked into Louisville Metro Corrections, with jail records indicating charges of first-degree riot and first-degree criminal mischief. Louisville mayor: 'Answering violence with violence' not the answer to Taylor death Why was there a protest? The death of Taylor, who was fatally shot March 13 by LMPD officers in her southwest Louisville apartment, was the main issue on the minds of protesters. Taylor's case has gained national and international attention in recent weeks as more information came to light on how police forced their way into her apartment as part of a narcotics investigation. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he and Taylor were scared and unsure of who was trying to gain entry to the apartment that night, while the officers have claimed they announced themselves several times. After officers used a battering ram to force their way into the apartment on Springfield Drive, Walker fired one shot that he says was in self-defense before the three officers responded with a hail of bullets, hitting Taylor eight times. No drugs were found inside Taylor's apartment. The FBI and Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron have since announced separate reviews of Taylor's death and the actions of the LMPD officers. Was the protest also about George Floyd? As mentioned, protesters focused mainly on calling for justice in Taylor's death. But the protests in Louisville unfurled as other cities saw similar demonstrations over police killings of black Americans, including in Phoenix, Denver and Minneapolis, where a man named George Floyd died after a white officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck. Floyd's death this week was captured on camera. That footage, coupled with how a transcript of a 911 call revealed that a clerk had accused Floyd of buying cigarettes with fake money, ignited protests around the country. Ben Crump, the Florida-based attorney representing Taylor's family, appeared Friday morning on MSNBC and called the recent, high-profile killings of black Americans “a national pandemic that’s affecting all African Americans.” “It is a state of emergency,” he said. What did Taylor's family and others say? As the situation in downtown Louisville escalated, Taylor's family took to social media to plead for peace. ""We are not going to stop until we get justice,"" Juniyah Palmer, Taylor's younger sister, said in a video. ""But we should stop tonight before people get hurt."" And during a Friday appearance on CNN, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read a statement from Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer: ""Breonna devoted her own life to saving other lives, to helping others, to making people smile, and to bringing people together. The last thing she’d want right now is any more violence. Changes are being made, but it’s not enough. We will not stop until there is truth, justice and accountability. Breonna’s legacy will not be forgotten. And it’s because of all of us saying her name and demanding justice. We are saying her name more each day. Thank you. Please keep saying her name. Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let’s do it the right way without hurting each other. We can, and we will make some real change here. Now’s the time. Let’s make it happen."" How many protesters were there Thursday? An estimated 500 to 600 protesters gathered in the streets of downtown Louisville for several hours. The gathering began as early as 6 or 7 p.m. and stretched past midnight. Where did it take place Thursday? Crowds moved from outside City Hall on Sixth Street to in front of the KFC Yum Center, where more police officers began to engage with the crowd. This story will be updated.

As they raided the supplies, people nearby screamed that they were for peaceful protesters. Within seconds, Kentucky State Police in riot gear moved in to block the officers from the people whose belongings they were taking. The incident, caught on video and tweeted by a reporter, swiftly went viral. It was the start of the third consecutive night of protests in Louisville related to the police killing of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor. Large-scale protests — often featuring violence from demonstrators and law enforcement — condemning police brutality against Black people swept the nation Saturday night. In Louisville, law enforcement exhibited less patience toward protesters than on previous nights, with a 9 p.m. curfew imposed and the National Guard called in to help enforce it. Many social media users criticized the seizure of the supplies, comparing it to looters who destroyed property in Louisville Friday night. So… theft and destruction of property is okay when police are the criminals? — meg (@MegAndBubba) May 31, 2020 Police have used tear gas and other non-lethal methods to try to disperse the crowds each night of the protests. Some people use milk or water to try to stem the pain of the tear gas. Mayor Greg Fischer responded to the incident during a news conference after the curfew was in effect. “Interspersed with that water and milk, there were other materials. There were mason jars full of flammable material, other materials that could not be identified that could have been used to be harmful to other protesters, also have been used to be harmful to law enforcement,” he said. “So the best decision for the safety of everybody was to remove those materials.” Jessie Halladay, a spokeswoman for Louisville Metro Police, told WFPL News in an email LMPD had been watching the preparation of supplies brought in by demonstrators in recent days. “With those observations as well as information gathered from sources in the crowd, we determined items in those supplies were being utilized by some to enable unlawful activity. We have seen these same materials used in the past two days to destroy property and injure officers. I believe all materials thought to be hazardous were removed safely from the area,” she wrote. She declined to provide further detail about what hazardous materials were believed to be present. She also declined to explain how such materials were moved safely. In the video, officers can be seen throwing and breaking bottles and boxes. Hurt is an understatement! Mayor Greg Fischer literally just lied on me and my daughter say that the items in the video… Posted by Aprile Hearn on Saturday, May 30, 2020 After the mayor’s briefing, which was also streamed on Facebook, a woman named Aprile Hearn who claimed to be the owner of the supplies wrote in a Facebook post that Fischer was wrong about the supplies. “Mayor Greg Fischer literally just lied on me and my daughter say that the items in the video that’s circulating of the police throwing our stuff in their trucks contained flammable substance in mason jars,” Hearn wrote. “THAT WAS A WHOLE LIE!” The ACLU of Kentucky also expressed skepticism regarding the appropriateness of the action.",0.0
1621377341,2020-05-31 03:21:36,At Least 33 Arrested In Third Night Of Louisville Protests,https://wfpl.org/at-least-33-arrested-in-third-night-of-louisville-protests/,en,False,,93009,wfpl.org,http://wfpl.org/#spider,"With downtown Louisville battered and boarded following two days of protests, Gov. Andy Beshear called in the National Guard Saturday and Mayor Greg Fischer instituted a citywide curfew beginning at sundown in advance of another night of demonstrations. As the evening unfolded, protesters massed and dispersed in skirmishes with police around the city. At various moments groups blocked the Second Street Bridge, Bardstown Road in the Highlands and several blocks of downtown. Unlike previous nights, Louisville Metro Police, Kentucky State Police and Kentucky National Guard used Jefferson Square Park as a staging area, setting up a perimeter around Metro Hall and City Hall. With the sun setting, police shot tear gas and green smoke at protesters on Liberty and Sixth streets in downtown. As police moved forward they also shot tear gas behind the protesters forcing them to move through the fog. Jay Dotta was there in a black mask holding a cell phone. He’s from Louisville and has been downtown for each night of action against the police killing of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor in March. “They will have no choice but to change. If we force their hand they have to change because unforced they will not change,” Dotta said. He says the police who killed Taylor should have been arrested — and if they were… “This wouldn’t be going on. If they weren’t at home on paid administrative leave, this wouldn’t be going on,” he said. It was just minutes later when officers launched tear gas and fired non-lethal pellets at the protesters. The crowd quickly left. But the night was far from over. From that point on, downtown became a whirlwind of small standoffs between police and protesters. State police, local police and the National Guard patrolled the streets on foot, on horseback and in humvees. Many wore riot gear. Drones and helicopters buzzed overhead. Jorden Ward, 21, said the cops were more forceful than in previous nights, firing pepper balls and tear gas without warning. Ward said he was struck by pepper balls at least three times while trying to help a friend who was arrested in the scramble. “They were throwing riot shields in our faces, they had the sticks out and were literally hitting us with the stick, backing us up,” Ward said. “Like, we literally weren’t being mean at all. We were taking steps back slowly. Cara Ryan of Louisville says she had successfully broken up a fight between protesters in front of a line of police at the corner of 6th and Liberty when an officer pushed her to the ground. She fell, cutting both her legs at the shin. Ryan’s legs were bandaged but still bleeding. “And I’m still in shock, my bone is actually exposed right now under my bandage,” Ryan said. She had a long, thin bruise striped across her back where she says she was hit three times with a baton. In the Bardstown Road corridor, police mostly gave protesters a wide berth as they walked up and down Bardstown Road. But the relative calm was shattered around 11 p.m., when a stand-off at Highland Avenue reached a tipping point. Protesters said someone threw a water bottle. An officer at the scene said there was gunfire, but an LMPD spokesperson said they haven’t confirmed that. Either way, LMPD and the National Guard took swift action, declaring an unlawful assembly. Authorities released tear gas and fired flash bangs repeatedly, and advanced across Bardstown Road firing pepper balls at individual protesters. They then drove several police vehicles down Highland Avenue. When law enforcement was satisfied that the scene had been neutralized, they marched away — the only remnant of their presence the spent pepper balls and tear gas canisters the protesters came back to reclaim as souvenirs. Shortly before 11 p.m., Mayor Fischer held a virtual press conference and commended protesters for what he described as a noticeable difference in the tone — there was less destruction of property — and he thanked protesters for their relatively peaceful assemblies. As the night wore on in downtown, multiple skirmishes coalesced into a roving march of several hundred young people roaming through streets of downtown. The protest appeared largely peaceful, although there were fireworks shot off as well as allegations of gunshots. It is unclear if anyone was injured, but WFPL reporters did not see anyone injured. Eventually, police formed a line following the protesters through downtown and appeared to guide the protesters without directly confronting them. At one point, even police had to laugh at the sight of a pair of riding lawn mower owners riding along with a group of protesters. After midnight, the protest headed west on Broadway. Five shots rang out. People ran back toward the police, but police pushed forward. As WFPL reporters rounded the corner of a business on Ninth Street, police fired teargas and pepper balls. Reporters dropped to the ground, but the police behind told reporters to stand up and keep moving. At the same time another line of police yelled at reporters to get on the ground. In the chaos, police arrested at least two protesters. No reporters were arrested. Sometime after 1 a.m. the protests began to wane, though a heavy police presence remained in downtown. As of 2 a.m., a police spokesperson said at least 33 arrests had been made and sirens continued to sound through the streets of downtown Louisville. During a Sunday morning news conference, Mayor Fischer said about 40 people had been arrested.",0.0

RIGHT NOW, WE ARE GETTING ANOTHER LIVE LOOK FROM CHOPPER HD AND WE HAVE THE URBAN LEAGUE PRESIDENT WITH US. YOU ARE A VERY WELL-KNOWN AND OUTSPOKEN MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY IN LOUISVILLE. GIVE US YOUR TAKE ON THE LAST FEW NIGHTS AND THE PROTESTS WE HAVE SEEN. >> WELL, THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING ME ON. I WANT TO, FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE TO PUT THIS RAGE INTO CONTEXT. I THINK PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO THEIR OUTRAGE AND THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO PEACEFUL PROTEST. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN LOUISVILLE FOR THE MOST PART ARE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO HAVE THESE PEACEFUL PROTESTS. FOR A WHILE, THEY HAVE BEEN AND BOTH NIGHTS, THEY HAVE GONE BAD. TONIGHT SO FAR HAS BEEN PEACEFUL BUT I HAVE BEEN OUT THERE AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT IS SCARY TONIGHT. IN A WAY THAT THE OTHER TWO NIGHTS WERE NOT. I OBVIOUSLY WAS NOT THERE LAST NIGHT WHEN PEOPLE WERE LOOTING BUT YOU GET THE SENSE -- I HOPE I AM WRONG. I SAW SOMEONE TONIGHT. IT IS A LITTLE EERIE. CAN I SAY THIS? I THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US IN LOUISVILLE BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN BE THE BEST CITY IN THE COUNTRY TO IDENTIFY HOW IT IS WE GOT HERE. TO UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING. BLACK PEOPLE ESPECIALLY ARE TIRED OF BEING ABUSED, OF NOT BEING HEARD. THAT IS ALL I KNOW HOW TO DO. WHEN COLIN KAEPERNICK KNEELED PEACEFULLY, PEOPLE WERE UPSET ABOUT THAT. THERE REALLY IS NO WAY THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY PEOPLE IN POWER FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES. THAT IS WHY YOU KEEP HAVING OVER AND OVER, YEAR AFTER YEAR. THE POWER DYNAMICS HAVE NOT CHANGED. PEOPLE STILL DON’T FEEL MORE VALUED, MORE VALUABLE. ACCESS TO JUSTICE HAS NOT CHANGED. IF YOU ALL THINK ABOUT IT, WERE IT NOT FOR THE CAMERAS AND SOME OF THESE CASES, WE WOULD NEVER KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. IN THE CASE OF BREONNA, WE WOULDN’T KNOW. IF HER MOTHER HAD NOT BEEN SO PERSISTENT, WE WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN THAT START OF THE STORY. THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE THERE IS NO OUTLET FOR JUSTICE. IF THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS CITY TONIGHT -- AND I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS OF ALL RACES AND SOME OF THEM GOT THEIR BUSINESSES AND ALLIES LAST NIGHT. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IF YOU ARE PUSHING FOR PROTESTING TO END AND YOU ARE NOT WITH THE SAME FORCE PUSHING FOR JUSTICE, WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS WE ARE AT AN IMPASSE. WE DESERVE JUSTICE. AND I LOVE THIS CITY AND I DON’T WANT TO SEE ANYTHING HAPPEN. STEPHON: I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT. YOU MENTIONED A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND A SENTIMENT I GOT WHILE I WAS DOWN THERE LAST NIGHT FROM PROTESTERS WHO ARE RESIDENTS OF WEST LOUISVILLE. A PART OF THE COMMUNITY YOU HAVE BEEN CHAMPIONING FOR. THE COMPLEX YOU ARE TRYING TO PUT OUT THERE. THE COMMUNITIES YOU ARE TRYING TO REVITALIZE FREEDOM THE SENTIMENT TO YOUR POINT, HE WANTS PEOPLE TO KEEP THE SAME ENERGY THEY HAD WHEN THEY SEE THE UNFORTUNATE LOOTING AND THE VIOLENCE. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO PUT INTO CONTEXT HOW DO YOU THINK THE CITY MOVES FORWARD. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE SEEING PROTESTS. IT IS NOT AS SEVERE AS OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BUT TO THAT POINT, YOU HAVE A LOT OF CITIES AROUND OUR COUNTRY, INCLUDING YOUR HOME STATE IN NEW YORK WHERE PEOPLE ARE OUTRAGED. HOW DOES THIS CITY MOVE FORWARD IN LOUISVILLE? YOU THINK ABOUT THE GEORGE FLOYD CASE. YOU THINK ABOUT AHMAUD ARBERY BUT IN OUR CITY, WE ARE DEALING WITH THE BREONNA TAYLOR CASE WHERE THERE ARE STILL CALLS FOR THE ARREST OF THE THREE OFFICERS INVOLVED. HOW DOES THE CITY MOVE FORWARD FROM THIS? SADIQA: I HAVE BEEN ON THE PHONE ALL DAY, ALL YESTERDAY. I DON’T FEEL LIKE I HAVE SLEPT IN DAYS BETWEEN TRYING TO BE DOWNTOWN AND FIGURING OUT WHAT’S HAPPENING AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD. SADLY, PEOPLE WANT COMPLETE JUSTICE. AND THAT IS NOT SET -- IT IS SAID THEY HAVE TO DEMANDED. THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT THESE OFFICERS WHO WERE WRONG WILL BE INDICTED IN LOUISVILLE AND THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE THE TIMING OF THAT. I KNOW IT WILL HAPPEN, I BELIEVE IT WILL HAPPEN. THIS CAN’T GO ON. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN OUR COUNTRY, WE HAVE TO BEGIN TALKING ABOUT HOW CAN WE HAVE THIS MANY DEATHS, THIS MANY PEOPLE KILLED, INNOCENT PEOPLE KILLED IN THIS SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME? THAT’S WHAT’S BUBBLING UP. NO ONE IS ASKING THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS. WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT VERY REAL DIALOGUE FOLLOWED BY SOME SERIOUS ACTION. AND THE ONLY ACTION RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE ACROSS AMERICA IS THAT FOLKS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THAT IS THE ANSWER. WE SHOULD NOT BURN OUR CITIES DOWN. WE SHOULD NOT PUT OURSELVES IN HARMS WAY, BUT WE SHOULD BE RAISING OUR VOICES FOR CHANGE BECAUSE THIS IS AS EMOTIONALLY DRAINING FOR ME AS A MOTHER, AS A WOMAN, AS A BLACK WOMAN. I CANNOT EXPLAIN THE PAIN. I AM SURE YOU HAVE SOME AND I KNOW THERE ARE WHITE PEOPLE WHO DO AS WELL. THIS IS PAINFUL TO WATCH. THIS IS PAINFUL TO PARTICIPATE IN BUT WHAT WE HAVE SUFFERED HAS BEEN PAINFUL AND UNTIL PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE POWER TO REALLY MAKE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE, WE ARE ALL GOING TO HAVE HELL TO PAY. LAST THING, PLEASE. WE ARE NOT SAFE, SOME OF THOSE OFFICERS YOU LOOK AT THEM AND YOU KNOW THEY ARE SCARED. WE HAVE GOOD POLICE OFFICERS, SOME OF THEM AND THE BAD ONES FOR THE GOOD ONES AT RISK. STEPHON: ABSOLUTELY. TO YOUR POINT, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD OFFICERS OUT THERE BUT THE POINT OF PROTESTERS WE TALKED TO LAST NIGHT AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST WEEK AND PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, THEY ARE SAYING YOU CAN HAVE AFFORD TO HAVE BAD APPLES AND NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES AT HAND. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE TIMING? I KNOW MORE PROTESTERS I WERE TALKING TO LAST NIGHT, THEY WERE SAYING YOU COULD ARREST THESE OFFICERS, JUST INDICT THEM ON PROBABLE CAUSE. YOU LOOK AT THE CASE HERE, YOU LOOK AT THE CASE IN MINNEAPOLIS WHERE THEY GOT THE ARREST OF ONE OF THE OFFICERS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF TIMING IN COMPARISON TO THE PROTESTS THAT ARE ONGOING? YOU HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE WANTING TO SEE BASIC JUSTICE IN THIS CASE. SADIQA: IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IN MINNEAPOLIS, YOU HAVE THE ONE OFFICER. AGAIN, PEOPLE ARE SAYING, WAIT A MINUTE, THERE ARE OTHER OFFICERS THERE WHO SHOULD HAVE INTERVENED. WE WANT ALL GONE. WE WANT THEM ALL INDICTED. WE DON’T WANT PARTIAL JUSTICE. I TALKED EARLIER TODAY ABOUT, JUST THINK ABOUT RODNEY KING. WE HAVE WATCHED A VIDEO OF THIS MAN BEING BEATEN, NO JUSTICE, NO CONSEQUENCES, NO NOTHING. THIS THING JUST SPELLS OUT. FROM A TIMING STANDPOINT IN LOUISVILLE, UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A WHILE BEFORE WE KNOW WHAT IS TO HAPPEN COMPLETELY WITH THOSE OFFICERS AND I DON’T THINK THAT IS IN OUR INTEREST AND I DON’T KNOW HOW THAT CAN BE EXPEDITED, I THINK IT OUGHT TO BE. I UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN MOST PEOPLE. I AM AN ATTORNEY COME I HAVE BEEN A JUDGE. I KNOW IT IS NOT A QUICK PROCESS. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS. WITH THE UNION. IT IS A COMPLICATED PROCESS BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING TO ME AND I WROTE THIS IN MY LETTER YESTERDAY, WHEN WE ARE THE VICTIMS THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION. WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT MONEY, WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT LAWSUITS. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY, WHAT LAST NIGHT IS GOING TO COST THIS CITY? WE HAVE GOT TO ACT LIKE OUR LIVES MATTER AND I WANT TO SAY -- I LIKE THE MAYOR. BY MORE THAN LIKE THE MAYOR. I HAVE WORKED FOR THE MAYOR. HE IS TRYING BUT HE MUST UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT PERSONAL TOWARDS HIM. THIS IS ABOUT STRUCTURAL AND SYSTEMIC RACISM AND BIAS THAT HAS PERVADED OUR COUNTRY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF IT. IT IS TIME TO FIX IT. WE CAN DO IT. LOUISVILLE CAN DO IT BUT WE ALL HAVE TO WANT TO DO IT. JULIE: WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR VOICE AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO MAKE OUR CITY BETTER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TONIGHT IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO LEAVE US WITH? SADIQA: THERE ARE. I WANT TO SAY THIS, EVERYBODY OUT THERE TONIGHT ESPECIALLY IS NOT PROTESTING FOR THE SAME THING. WE HAVE DIFFERENT GROUPS OUT THERE. IF YOU HAVE A STEP OUT, IT TAKES FIVE MINUTES TO FIGURE THAT OUT. TONIGHT, PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHO IT IS THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING BECAUSE YOU WILL BE LED INTO SOMETHING TERRIBLE. THIS IS THE SAME THING LAST NIGHT. YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE JUST TRYING TO BE PEACEFUL, TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEIR VOICES WERE HEARD AND TRYING TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THE MEMORIES OF THOSE WE HAVE LOS AND INSTEAD PEOPLE WENT ANOTHER ROUTE. THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH OF THOSE PEOPLE BUT THERE IS ENOUGH TO CAUSE A LOT OF DAMAGE AND DO SOME DAMAGE TO THE MOVEMENT. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THIS BUT THAT WE ARE EFFECTIVE AND THAT THE PEOPLE ARE STRATEGIC ABOUT IT. THAT MEANS DON’T HURT YOURSELF TRYING TO SAVE YOURSELF. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS. WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS AND WE WILL GET JUSTICE THIS TIME. WE HAVE TO. STEPHON: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

PLEASE STAY HOME AND STAY SAFE THAT'S Advertisement Day 4 of Louisville protests: Protesters, State Leaders demand justice in Breonna Taylor case Share Shares Copy Link Copy SUNDAYAfter a third night of protests in Louisville resulted in 37 arrests, Sunday started off peaceful with demonstrations in St. Matthews and Downtown Louisville. Faith leaders gathered to address protests and share Mayor Greg Fischer’s response to demands made by the Interdenominational Ministerial Coalition in the Breonna Taylor case.A peaceful protest organized by Black Lives Matter at the KFC Yum Center drew hundreds. Senate hopeful, Rep. Charles Booker also spoke during the event, urging Louisvillians to make their voice heard this election. As of 6 p.m., the 2nd Street Bridge closed due to protesters. THIRD NIGHT OF PROTESTSFor a third night in a row, protesters marched along Louisville streets to call for justice for Breonna Taylor, the woman who was killed during a LMPD raid in March.The National Guard was called in to assist Metro Police with crowd control on Saturday and mayor Greg Fischer implemented a dusk-to-dawn curfew.What you need to know about the curfew Police arrested around 10 people, but Fischer said the crowd was significantly smaller on Saturday and looting and vandalism remained very isolated. Around 5 p.m., protesters began blocking the 2nd Street Bridge. And by 7 p.m., groups of protesters formed a barricade in downtown Louisville before migrating to a different spot. Police said protesters even attempted to walk up the ramp at 9th street onto Interstate 64. Despite some tense moments in the Highlands, by 9:30 p.m. on Saturday, most large groups had been dispersed. However, police said smaller groups remained a problem. Two groups of protesters were still on Baxter Ave and downtown around 10:45 p.m. Protesters moved into cars and paraded through downtown in a loosely organized caravan. Several people had guns, hung out windows and yelled profanity.And even though there was heavier police presence and smaller crowds, LMPD said they stayed fully staffed until 4 a.m. as a precaution.Officials reported a double shooting in the 700 block of South Clay, however it's not believed to be related to protests.SECOND NIGHT OF PROTESTSProtests turned into riots in Louisville Friday as people once again called for justice in the Breonna Taylor case. It was the second night in a row hundreds flocked downtown to make their voices heard.Groups started gathering sometime around 5 p.m. By 7 p.m., two separate demonstrations had formed. One marched around downtown Louisville, and the other launched from NuLu.Around 7:45 p.m., hundreds packed the front of City Hall chanting, ""no justice, no peace,"" as they did the day before. Others chanted, ""I can't breathe,"" in reference to the killing of George Floyd. As it got close to 9 p.m., all protesting remained peaceful. But not long after, the atmosphere tensed. Flags were torn down from the Hall of Justice; at least two were burned. WLKY saw people breaking out its windows, as well.Then, more than 100 officers in riot gear arrived on scene. By 9:45 p.m., officers had deployed tear gas. People were seen running from it, pouring milk into their eyes to relieve the pain. Pepper balls, which are similar to paint balls, were also used. Crowds eventually marched away from downtown and into the Highlands neighborhood onto Bardstown Road. Well past midnight, things continued to escalate. There have been reports of looting at multiple businesses at 4th Street Live! and nearby.At some point in the night, protesters destroyed a WLKY news vehicle.Police said in a late-night update that they believe many of the protesters are not from Louisville.Mayor Greg Fischer held a news conference at 1 a.m. as people were still out protesting, asking Louisvillians to stay home. Police have said that they believe many of the protesters are not from Louisville.See our Facebook page for more pictures and videos from the protestsFIRST NIGHT OF PROTESTSThursday protests started out calm, but after several hours, turned violent when several shots rang out and seven people were hurt. All are expected to recover, and police says the shots did not come from officers. The protests also resulted in some destruction around the city, including shattered windows, graffiti on buildings, broken statues and more. City and state officials spent Friday making statements about the case and responding to the protests, most calling for people to remain peaceful as they pursue justice. Officers used tear gas, smoke grenades and pepper balls to try and control crowds. Police also said two officers were taken to the hospital with medical conditions spurred by the event. Three people were arrested, but none for the shooting. To prepare for what's to come, all off days for police were canceled. Kentucky State Police will also be on hand to help. LMPD said it is prepared to take action whatever action it must to keep people safe.The mayor also asked people to be safe, not only regarding the shooting, but also the coronavirus. He asked that people gathering in big groups continue to wear masks and social distance.BACKGROUND ON THE CASETaylor, 26, was shot and killed by Louisville Metro Police officers back in March when they executed a search warrant at her apartment.Earlier Thursday afternoon, a 911 call made by Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, was released by her family's attorneys. Commonwealth Attorney Tom Wine said Walker made the call after officers retreated following the gunfire.Walker was initially charged with attempted murder of a police officer after the raid. Officials said he fired first. Walker has said he believed police to be intruders.That charge was dropped last Friday after the prosecutors said they needed more evidence.The FBI and Kentucky Attorney General are now investigating the officers' actions. The officers involved are Sgt. Jon Mattingly, who was shot in the leg during the incident, and Detectives Myles Cosgrove and Brett Hankison.Since the shooting, they have been on administrative reassignment.Protesters WLKY spoke with Thursday said they want to see those officers fired and charged. On Friday, both Fischer and Attorney General Daniel Cameron said these decisions will take time. Fischer said that's in large part due to lack of video.None of the officers were wearing body cameras that night.PROTESTS NATIONWIDETaylor's family is being represented by lawyers who are also representing the family's of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd.Both of their deaths have sparked nationwide outrage recently, as well. Arbery's death seems to have played a part in bringing Taylor's back into the light.Floyd's death led to major unrest in Minneapolis over the last few days. Protesters even torched a police precinct. Then, on Friday, the officer seen kneeling on his neck was arrested and charged with murder in his death.Prior to that announcement, the attorneys discussed all three cases together, calling for a congressional hearing and the creation of a national task force that would create bipartisan legislation aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability.",0.0

JENNIFER: TH Advertisement National coronavirus updates: Top health officials monitoring nationwide protests in fear of virus spread Share Shares Copy Link Copy The latest:There have been more than 1.9 million coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The U.S. death toll has surpassed 110,000 people, according to Hopkins.The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month.New World Health Organization guidance recommends that fabric masks — which can be homemade — be at least three layers.Health officials have raised concern about coronavirus spread as thousands of people are now braving a pandemic to participate in the national protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday it was closely monitoring the demonstrations taking place across the U.S. and warned such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases.For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said without the lockdowns that most states put in place, that death toll could have been significantly higher.As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out and always maintain a distance.But the large protests make it hard to keep the recommended social distancing guidelines and ""may put others at risk,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.""It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal COVID-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground,"" she said.Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus.""I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,"" he said — especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.So far, more than 1,942,000 people have been infected in the U.S., and at least 110,514 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some states see rise in new casesWhile the early parts of the outbreak in the country hit dense metropolitan areas on the coast the hardest — including California and New York — the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Harris County, Texas, health officials said they identified a nursing home with both cases of the virus and deaths.On Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health said on Twitter. Utah State Rep. Suzanne Harrison called the spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend. ""Please be careful. Practice social distancing. Avoid crowds. Use masks where appropriate. Wash your hands.""Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs — including Arkansas State, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.An important drug could run out Meanwhile, as officials emphasize the U.S. is not yet out of the woods, a government official gave a stark warning. The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir last month. The drug, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola, is now used on hospitalized Covid patients. A study has shown it helps cut down the length of hospital stays.The government has been working to help Gilead ""with some of their supply chain challenges in terms of raw materials and being able to accelerate the process,"" Kadlec said.""Whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,"" he said.",0.0

NEW YORK — Street protests rocked New York City for a third straight day Saturday, even as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio pleaded for calm after a demonstration the previous night left people bloodied and vehicles burned. A large crowd marched through Harlem, chanted outside a police precinct then blocked traffic on the highway along Manhattan’s East River. Farther south in Manhattan, thousands of demonstrators paraded around Union Square. Other groups marched through Brooklyn and Queens. Demonstrations during daylight hours were mostly peaceful, but as evening fell protesters hurled objects at officers, set numerous fires, torched and smashed police vehicles and blocked roads with garbage and wreckage. Dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly. Video showed two police cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators on a Brooklyn street, knocking several to the ground, after people attacked it with thrown objects, including something on fire. It was unclear whether anyone was hurt. In numerous flare-ups, officers sprayed crowds with chemicals. Protesters smashed the windows on police vehicles, sprayed them with paint and set a patrol car on fire. Videos showed protesters dancing on top of a smashed police van, its lights still flashing. The protests, among many around the country over the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minnesota, came a day after several thousand people faced off with a force of officers on the streets around a Brooklyn sports arena. De Blasio, a Democrat, expressed solidarity with demonstrators upset about police brutality, but promised an independent review of the Friday night disaster in which a mob set fire to a police van and battered police cruisers with clubs and officers beat people with batons. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he had asked the state's attorney general, Letitia James, to lead an inquiry and make a public report. The mayor said he was upset by videos of confrontations “where protesters were handled very violently” by police, including one that showed a woman being needlessly thrown to the ground. But de Blasio said some protesters had come “with an agenda of violence and incitement, and they meant to harm police officers, and they did harm police officers.” “They were subjected to horrible, vile things last night,” de Blasio said.. One demonstrator in Friday's confrontations, Samantha Shader, 27, of Catskill, New York, was arrested on an attempted murder charge after police said she tossed a homemade firebomb at a vehicle occupied by several officers. The device did not ignite and the officers were unharmed, police said. Police also arrested her sister, Darian Shader, 21, on charges of resisting arrest and obstructing police. They were in custody Saturday and it wasn't immediately clear whether lawyers had been appointed to represent them. City police said in a Twitter posting Saturday evening that federal charges were expected to be filed against “multiple” people for incidents involving homemade bombs. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said more than 200 people were arrested and multiple officers were injured Friday, including one who lost a tooth. Asked to comment on videos that showed officers shoving peaceful protesters to the ground and hitting people with batons, Shea said those acts would be investigated. But, he said, “It is very hard to practice de-escalation when there is a brick being thrown at your head.” “It is by the grace of God that we don’t have dead officers today,” he said. Elsewhere in the state, the mayor in Rochester declared a state of emergency and a 9 p.m. curfew after demonstrators destroyed police cars, setting one on fire, and officers responded with tear gas canisters. The protests were all held in defiance of a statewide ban on gatherings imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus. “This is bigger than the pandemic,” said Brooklyn protester Meryl Makielski, referring to the outbreak that, until recently, was killing hundreds of New Yorkers each day. “The mistakes that are happening are not mistakes. They’re repeated violent terrorist offenses and people need to stop killing black people. Cops seem as though they’ve been trained to do so.” The Rev. Al Sharpton addressed several hundred people gathered in Staten Island at the spot where Eric Garner died after being placed in a chokehold by a police officer in 2014. He was accompanied by Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr. The crowd held a peaceful demonstration outside the local police precinct. Sharpton noted that Floyd, who died Monday in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes, had also fallen unconscious gasping for air. “Right at this spot is where we heard Eric Garner say what six years later was said by George: ‘I can’t breathe.’” Cuomo noted that Floyd's death was just the latest in a long list of similar deaths, and he said he shared in the outrage over “this fundamental injustice.”",0.0
1621495694,2020-05-31 05:00:00,Protests Rage in Dozens of US Cities,http://westkentuckystar.com/News/National-World/Protests-Rage-in-Dozens-of-US-Cities.aspx,en,True,,264427,westkentuckystar.com,http://westkentuckystar.com/,"Protests Rage in Dozens of US Cities By The Associated Press MINNEAPOLIS - Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black people grew Saturday from New York to Tulsa to Los Angeles, with police cars set ablaze and reports of injuries mounting on all sides as the country convulsed through another night of unrest after months of coronavirus lockdowns.The protests, which began in Minneapolis following Floyd's death Monday after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing, have left parts of the city a grid of broken windows, burned-out buildings and ransacked stores. The unrest has since become a national phenomenon as protesters decry years of deaths at police hands.Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the country, many of them not wearing masks or observing social distancing, raising concerns among health experts about the potential for spreading the coronavirus pandemic at a time when much of the country is in the process of reopening society and the economy.After a tumultuous Friday night, racially diverse crowds took to the streets again for mostly peaceful demonstrations in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The previous day’s protests also started calmly, but many descended into violence later in the day.— In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds were taunting Secret Service agents. Dressed in camouflage and holding shields, the troops stood in a tight line a few yards from the crowd, preventing them from pushing forward. President Donald Trump, who spent much of Saturday in Florida for the SpaceX rocket launch, landed on the lawn in the presidential helicopter at dusk and went inside without speaking to journalists.— In Philadelphia, at least 13 officers were injured when peaceful protests turned violent and at least four police vehicles were set on fire. Other fires were set throughout downtown.— In the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of a 1921 massacre of black people that left as many as 300 dead and the city’s thriving black district in ruins, protesters blocked intersections and chanted the name of Terence Crutcher, a black man killed by a police officer in 2016.— In Seattle, police fired tear gas and stun grenades to try to disperse black-clad crowds that smashed downtown shopfronts, stole merchandise and tossed mannequins onto the street.— In Los Angeles, protesters chanted “Black Lives Matter,” some within inches of the face shields of officers. Police used batons to move the crowd back and fired rubber bullets. One man used a skateboard to try to break a police SUV's windshield. A spray-painted police car burned in the street.— And in New York City, dangerous confrontations flared repeatedly as officers made arrests and cleared streets. A video showed two NYPD cruisers lurching into a crowd of demonstrators who were pushing a barricade against one of them and pelting it with objects, knocking several people to the ground. It was unclear if anyone was hurt.“Our country has a sickness. We have to be out here,” said Brianna Petrisko, among those at lower Manhattan’s Foley Square, where most were wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the only way we’re going to be heard.”Back in Minneapolis, the city where the protests began, 29-year-old Sam Allkija said the damage seen in recent days reflects longstanding frustration and rage in the black community.“I don’t condone them,” he said. “But you have to look deeper into why these riots are happening.”Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who said local forces had been overmatched Friday, fully mobilized the state’s National Guard and promised a massive show of force. The Guard announced Saturday it had more than 4,000 members responding to Minneapolis and would quickly have nearly 11,000.“The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd,” Walz said. “It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cities.”Soon after the city's 8 p.m. curfew went into force, lines of police cars and officers in riot gear moved in to confront protesters, firing tear gas to push away throngs of people milling around the city’s 5th police precinct station. The tougher tactics came after city and state leaders were criticized for not forcefully enough confronting days of violent and damaging protests that included protesters burning down a police station shortly after officers abandoned it.Trump appeared to cheer on the tougher tactics being used by law enforcement Saturday night. He commended the Guard deployment in Minneapolis, declaring “No games!” and also said police in New York City “must be allowed to do their job!”Overnight curfews were imposed in more than a dozen major cities nationwide, ranging from 6 p.m. in parts of South Carolina to 10 p.m. around Ohio. People were also told to be off the streets of Atlanta, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle and Minneapolis — where thousands had ignored the same order Friday night.More than 1,300 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday.The unrest comes at a time when most Americans have spent months inside over concerns surrounding the coronavirus, which the president has called an “invisible enemy.” The events of the last 72 hours, seen live on national television, have shown the opposite: a sudden pivot to crowds, screaming protesters and burning buildings, a stark contrast to the empty streets of recent months.“Quite frankly I’m ready to just lock people up,"" Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields said at a news conference. Demonstrations there turned violent Friday, and police were arresting protesters Saturday on blocked-off downtown streets. “Yes, you caught us off balance once. It’s not going to happen twice.”This week's unrest recalled the riots in Los Angeles nearly 30 years ago after the acquittal of the white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black motorist who had led them on a high-speed chase. The protests of Floyd's killing have gripped many more cities, but the losses in Minneapolis have yet to approach the staggering totals Los Angeles saw during five days of rioting in 1992, when more than 60 people died, 2,000-plus were injured and thousands arrested, with property damage topping $1 billion.Many protesters spoke of frustration that Floyd’s death was one more in a litany. It came in the wake of the killing in Georgia of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot dead after being pursued by two white men while running in their neighborhood, and in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic that has thrown millions out of work, killed more than 100,000 people in the U.S. and disproportionately affected black people.The officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck as he begged for air was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. But many protesters are demanding the arrests of the three other officers involved.Leaders in many affected cities have voiced outrage over Floyd's killing and expressed sympathy for protesters' concerns. But as the unrest intensified, they spoke of a desperate need to protect their cities and said they would call in reinforcements, despite concerns that could lead to more heavy-handed tactics.Minnesota has steadily increased to 1,700 the number of National Guardsmen it says it needs to contain the unrest, and the governor is considering a potential offer of military police put on alert by the Pentagon.Governors in Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas also activated the National Guard after protests there turned violent overnight, while nighttime curfews were put in place in Portland, Oregon, Cincinnati and elsewhere.Police in St. Louis were investigating the death of a protester who climbed between two trailers of a Fed Ex truck and was killed when it drove away. And a person was killed in the area of protests in downtown Detroit just before midnight after someone fired shots into an SUV, officers said. Police had initially said someone fired into the crowd from an SUV.",0.0

Dozens gathered Saturday evening in the city’s Circus Square Park to march against racial injustice and violence in the wake of the recent killings of three unarmed black individuals. A picture of this weekend's demonstrations in Bowling Green following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. Bystanders Wednesday captured Minneapolis resident George Floyd’s final moments as he lay handcuffed on his stomach. Video of the incident shows one police officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck while three others stand nearby. Floyd’s death and that of Louisville Emergency Medical Technician Breonna Taylor, who died March 13th while police served a no-knock warrant on her home, have led to mass demonstrations nationwide against deadly police interactions. Speaking to the crowd in Bowling Green, civil rights activist and Russellville resident Charles Neblett said he’d been working for justice for a long time. “And the more things seem to change, the more they stay the same. It started off when Emmett Till was murdered. I was 13 years old,” Neblett said. A third death, Georgia-native Ahmaud Arbery, has also been causing many to question the state of racial progress. Leaked video shows Arbery jogging when two individuals, one of whom was holding a shotgun, confronted him. The delay between Arbery’s killing and the arrest of suspects in the shooting have stoked concerns about the dangers of simply being black in the United States. Diondra Anthony is a special education instructor in Bowling Green. She said the death of Taylor, someone she relates to, has kept her up at night. Anthony attended the march wearing a white t-shirt and facemask that listed traits that describe her, including being college educated, a mother, employed, and having no criminal record. The t-shirt concluded the list by saying “Oh yeah, I’m Black.” “I just felt like that expression was basically, was what more do I have to do?” Anthony asked, wondering what it would take to keep her and others out of the situations Floyd, Taylor and Arbery faced. Meanwhile, several other individuals attended a protest Friday night that began along Kentucky street. There, James B. Hunton, 24, was arrested after bumping a demonstrator twice with his vehicle. The victim appeared to not have serious injuries at the time of the incident. Later in the evening, the Bowling Green Police Department stood nearby as protestors shifted toward Fountain Square Park. “We’re always concerned about people’s wellness. And to come out and exercise their constitutional rights but to not get injured doing it, or hurt or killed. I mean that’s a big deal, we don’t want anybody getting hurt when they’re out here exercising their rights,” Maj. Matt Edwards said. While demonstrating near Bowling Green’s Fountain Square Park later Friday evening, Yvonne Williams carried a megaphone with her, imparting three things she believes are important to keep in mind. “Not all cops are bad, not all black people are criminals and not all white people are criminals,” Williams said. Another demonstration is scheduled for Sunday night.",0.0

The protest started in response to the death of George Floyd. (Photo: Albert Cesare / The Enquirer) The recent murders of Ahmaud Arbery in Brunswick Georgia, Breona Taylor in Louisville Kentucky and George Floyd in Minneapolis have once again removed the scab of America's racial divide. The video of a white officer with his knee on the neck of a prone and handcuffed black man that resulted in Floyd's death will haunt this nation for generations to come. Floyd's dying words of, ""I can't breathe,"" have caused many to cry out, ""I can't sleep!"" I can't sleep in a nation that has historically shown little value for black life. I can't sleep when Ahmaud Arbery is chased through the streets like a deer and then gunned down by a shotgun-wielding self-privileged assailant. I can't sleep when Breona Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT, lay dead on her hallway floor, shot at least eight times by plainclothes officers who had burst in to execute a ""no-knock"" search warrant at her home. Recent events in our country precipitate the need for a ""Call to Prophetic Action."" In the Hebrew Scriptures, the prophet Jeremiah is called by God to challenge a wayward nation. The God of creation says to Jeremiah, ""I have appointed you to uproot, tear down, destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant."" It is long past time for America to uproot, tear down, destroy and overthrow the systems that uphold racism and white supremacy. We need to ""uproot"" too many white people's belief that this is their country and that all non-whites can be told to ""go back where they came from."" America belongs to all of us, especially those who have been hung, murdered and dehumanized on these shores. We need to ""tear down"" the justice systems that continue to disproportionately criminalize and incarcerate black and brown bodies, leaving in it's wake the rubble of broken families. We need to ""destroy"" an economic system that has 41 million people living below the poverty level while the 400 wealthiest Americans now own more wealth than the bottom 64% of the U.S. population. We need to ""overthrow"" what the Rev. William Barber, president of Repairers of the Breach calls, ""the realities of systemic racism, systemic poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and the often false moral narrative of Christian nationalism."" Protesters rally at Cincinnati Police District 1 headquarters, Friday, May 29, 2020, in Cincinnati to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died on Monday, May 25, 2020, in Minneapolis after a white police officer kneeled on his neck, ignoring Floyd's pleas that he could not breathe. (Photo: Kareem Elgazzar/The Enquirer) The prophet Jeremiah is first called to uproot, tear down and destroy and then build and plant. For over 400 years, black people in America have been trying to build and plant in a country where the soil is fertilized with racial animus. The system is tearing itself down, uprooted by its own broken and racist foundations. Now is the time to build. Build a justice system that does not criminalize and over prosecute black and brown bodies but treats all people as equals. A system that arrests, indicts, prosecutes and holds police officers accountable for their crimes against human lives. We need to support that justice system by creating a just economic system in America, one that provides all Americans the right to affordable housing, a living wage and affordable health care. How do we accomplish any of this? Black people and their allies must come together with an agenda for change. The time for tearing down and building is now. Rev.

Police cars and government buildings burned, the National Guard was deployed, and some of the country's largest cities instituted curfews. In one Midwest city, a person was killed and at least two more shot. More than 1,400 people have been arrested in 16 cities since Thursday, with more than 500 of those happening in Los Angeles on Friday, the Associated Press reported. Former officer Derek Chauvin faces the charges in Floyd's death, but activist groups say they are inadequate. Video from a bystander showed Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The demonstrations Saturday were part of a National Day of Protest against Chauvin and police brutality inflicted nationwide. Protesters also called out the names of other people of color killed by police, including Louisville's Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old ER tech who was shot and killed by police in March. Here is a city-by-city look at what's happening across the country. Indianapolis: One dead after shooting One person was killed Saturday and at least two more shot during a second night of protests downtown, Indianapolis Police Chief Randal Taylor confirmed in a hastily called late-night press conference. ""Enough is enough,"" Taylor said as sirens blared and fire trucks raced past on the street. ""Indianapolis, we are better than this. Downtown is not safe at this time.” Police did not have details on the individual who was killed nor the conditions of the others shot. Shortly before 1 a.m., the department tweeted again that it was investigating additional reports of shootings downtown. The shootings did not involve officers, police said. Protests during the day Saturday had been peaceful. — Staff of The Indianapolis Star Nashville: Fires at courthouse and City Hall building Fires in Nashville led Mayor John Cooper to declare a state of civil emergency. Police announced a 10 p.m. curfew for the city, and Gov. Bill Lee deployed the National Guard. Dozens of protesters had gathered on the steps of Nashville's criminal courthouse and City Hall after a rally and march. Demonstrators smashed windows with rocks and other materials, drawing a swarm of police.

Our streets.” Late Saturday, videos circulated on social media that show a police vehicle driving into a crowd of protesters, after objects were thrown at the vehicle. Mayor Bill de Blasio called the video ""upsetting"" and said he wishes the officer ""hadn't done that."" He added: ""It’s clear that a different element has come into play here, who are trying to hurt police officers and trying to damage their vehicles."" He said the situation was started by a group of protesters converging on the police car and attacking it. Other video showed at least one vehicle on fire. An initially peaceful demonstration in the city had spiraled into chaos Friday, as protesters skirmished with police officers, destroyed police vehicles and set fires.

No peace!"" and ""I can't breathe!"" – a phrase Floyd was heard saying before his death – in Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House and along surrounding streets. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., stood with peaceful protesters outside the White House during the afternoon. Protesters stood facing a line of police wearing helmets and holding shields, the officers with their backs to the White House. At times, some protesters tried to knock over barriers or attacked officers around the White House perimeter, although none scaled the surrounding fence, according to the Secret Service. ""Multiple"" special agents and uniformed officers were injured when some protesters threw bricks, rocks, bottles and fireworks at officers, officials said. Officers responded by firing tear gas to break up the crowds. President Donald Trump attended the historic SpaceX rocket launch in Florida during the afternoon, but arrived back at the White House around 8:30 p.m. as protests raged outside.

Police responded by pushing the crowd away, firing tear gas and bean bag rounds as they marched forward. At one point, some in the crowd tried to build a makeshift barrier with trash cans, but police pushed through and arrested several people. Others fled down streets and alleys. — Dan Horn, Madeline Mitchell, Cameron Knight and Sharon Coolidge, The Cincinnati Enquirer Des Moines, Iowa: Protesters throw fireworks at police Police in riot gear met protesters marching on the state’s Capitol building.

One person was seen breaking a glass window. — Des Moines Register staff Minneapolis: Projectiles fired to clear protesters The National Guard started moving into downtown Minneapolis on Saturday, after days of unrest. ""The situation in Minnesota is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd. It is about attacking civil society, instilling fear and disrupting our great cites,"" Gov. Tim Walz said in a press conference. An 8 p.m. curfew would be strictly enforced, major highways would be closed and those on the streets Saturday night could be subject to arrest, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Saint Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said Saturday night. “Don’t go out of your homes; don’t make things more difficult,” Walz said. As curfew approached, hundreds of protesters sat to await the arrival of law enforcement near Fifth Precinct. One commented that police couldn't arrest the whole group. Soon, black-clad law enforcement approached to the sound of explosions. Some demonstrators chanted: “Hands up, don’t shoot!” Police officers fired nonlethal projectiles toward masses of people, including a crowd of journalists gathered in an alley next to a looted store. Protesters reported tear gas being used. Some people hobbled away from an intersection appearing to be injured. ""State Patrol troopers are moving in to secure the Fifth Precinct. Go home and obey the curfew order now,"" Minnesota Department of Public Safety tweeted. — Trevor Hughes and Jordan Culver, USA TODAY Los Angeles: Looting and destruction mount, mayor sets curfew Looting and property destruction mounted Saturday in Los Angeles as police worked to disperse protesters after the third evening of mass demonstrations.

Police set up skirmish lines throughout the downtown area and fired non-lethal ammunition in at least one incident, City News Service reported. Garcetti requested the National Guard. Protesters looted several downtown businesses, including a Target store, a Rite Aid, a Starbucks and jewelry stores near Sixth Street and Broadway. Fires were ignited near the intersection of Hill and Seventh Street, and in one case, a person threw the hose being used by a firefighter into a smoldering fire. Garcetti urged residents to go home. “When things burn, it is not the time to stay,” he said. Taking part in civil unrest, he added, does a disservice to Floyd's memory. He noted Los Angeles has seen unrest over racial issues before, a nod to the Watts Riots in 1965 and the disturbance after the Rodney King verdict that exonerated the police officers who were videotaped beating him in 1992. — Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY Fayetteville, North Carolina: Reporter injured as looters break into J.C. Penney Protests turned violent in Fayetteville even after police opted to close access to downtown areas of the city.

When police horses entered the area, a chaotic few seconds followed: Police barricades tumbled to the ground and people fell down. Glass bottles flew through the air. At one point the crowd chanted: ""No justice, no peace."" The standoff was a dramatic contrast from a peaceful protest march earlier in the evening. That demonstration had apparently ended without arrests, and the police had largely let it play out on its own, without interference. Most of the crowd from the protest march left around 9 p.m. — Laura Testino, Desiree Stennett, Daniel Connolly, Corinne S Kennedy and Samuel Hardiman, Memphis Commercial Appeal Detroit: Day starts peacefully, turns violent Saturday, in the light of day, the protesting crowd appeared to be mostly peaceful, with police following marching protesters closely and even handing out masks, a coronavirus precaution, to those who did not have them. The situation changed late in the evening. A new — and larger — crowd filled downtown and turned violent. In the skirmishes, Detroit Free Press reporters were exposed to tear gas, and a phone was violently knocked out of a photographer's hand. Police in riot gear, supported by armored cars, moved toward protesters. Crowds began to gather at about 4:30 p.m. Most wore masks, and many carried signs, some with angry slogans. By about 8 p.m., and just after a moment of tension between protesters and police, the crowd began to disperse, with a few folks saying they'd be back again for a third day of demonstrations at 4 p.m. Sunday. On Friday, a 21-year-old male from Eastpointe was been fatally shot near a protest in downtown Detroit when he was approached by an unknown suspect while in his vehicle, police said. Friday night's protest had at least 60 arrests. — David Jesse, JC Reindl, Branden Hunter and Frank Witsil, Detroit Free Press Phoenix: Police demand protesters disperse A large group of protesters knelt with their hands up in the streets outside Phoenix police and municipal buildings. They chanted, ""Hands up, don't shoot"" and ""Black lives matter.""

The police department asked residents to stay away from Miami's downtown and Wynwood areas, citing a ""situation involving large crowds of protestors."" The Miami Herald reported protests in the area started peacefully but eventually devolved into violence. Flint, Michigan: Sheriff walks with protesters Video showed Genessee County Sheriff Christopher Swanson walking with protesters Saturday after taking off his riot gear. He joined the demonstration to cheers from attendees. In a video posted to Facebook, Swanson told the gathered protesters, ""We want to be with y'all, for real. I took the helmet off; they laid the batons down. We want to make this a parade."" As Swanson was talking, the crowd began to chant, ""Walk with us!"" Swanson began walking with the crowd, saying he could walk all night. Chicago: Demonstration outside Trump Tower; curfew in place Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced a curfew for the city, effective between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Earlier, hundreds of protesters gathered downtown at Federal Plaza on Saturday afternoon for a demonstration organized by Black Lives Matter. Protesters chanted “Say his name, George Floyd” and “Say her name, Breonna Taylor” as drivers honked their horns. Some held signs saying “Black lives matter” and “Liberty and justice for all.” At least two police vehicles were covered in spray paint.

A spokesperson for Chicago police said he was not immediately able to provide an update. The Chicago Transit Authority temporarily suspended train services to downtown. — Grace Hauck and Jordan Culver, USA TODAY Jacksonville, Florida: Damaged vehicles, officer injured Violence erupted in Jacksonville’s downtown Saturday night, after thousands of people earlier marched peacefully on police headquarters in protest of law enforcement abuses of force.

Police urged people not already downtown Saturday night to stay away from the area. — Teresa Stepzinski and Garry Smits, Florida Times-Union Philadelphia: Officers injured, peaceful protests turn chaotic Charred cars, one lying flipped on its roof in a pile of ashes, lined John F. Kennedy Blvd. Saturday night as the city started to clean up after peaceful protests gave way to a fiery afternoon.

Emily Wunderlich, Sarasota Herald-Tribune Peoria, Illinois: 'Fired up! Ready to go!'

Ready to go!"" Most attendees wore masks or other face coverings, which organizers urged to abide by the state's standing public health orders. The peaceful demonstration of just more than two hours included participants chanting not only Floyd's name, but also the names of Peoria men Eddie Russell Jr. and Luis Cruz, who were killed in police-involved shootings over the past three years.

1621531776,2020-05-30 20:11:08,'There are anarchists': Minnesota officials say 'outside agitators' are hijacking peaceful protests,http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/625623268/0/cincinnati-home~There-are-anarchists-Minnesota-officials-say-outside-agitators-are-hijacking-peaceful-protests/,en,False,,82890,nky.cincinnati.com,http://nky.cincinnati.com/#spider,"Corrections & Clarifications: An inconsistency in the editing process left an inaccurate headline on this story. It has been updated to reflect that the data shows the majority of those arrested at the time of this reporting were from Minnesota. MINNEAPOLIS — Drifting out of the shadows in small groups, dressed in black, carrying shields and wearing knee pads, they head toward the front lines of the protest. Helmets and gas masks protect and obscure their faces, and they carry bottles of milk to counteract tear gas and pepper spray. Most of them appear to be white. They carry no signs and don't want to speak to reporters. Trailed by designated ""medics"" with red crosses taped to their clothes, these groups head straight for the front lines of the conflict. Night after night in this ravaged city, these small groups do battle with police and the National Guard, kicking away tear gas canisters and throwing back foam-rubber projects fired at them. Around them, fires break out. Windows are smashed. Parked cars destroyed. USA TODAY reporters have witnessed the groups on multiple nights, in multiple locations. Sometimes they threaten those journalists who photograph them destroying property. The governor said outside agitators are hijacking peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd and literally fanning the flames of destruction. And experts say things will likely get worse there in Minneapolis and in other cities seeing similar peaceful protests that turn violent like Los Angeles; Louisville, Kentucky; Des Moines, Iowa; Detroit, Atlanta; and Washington, D.C. “The real hard-core guys, this is their job: They’re involved in this struggle,"" said Adam Leggat, a former British Army counterterrorism officer who now works as a security consultant specializing in crowd management for the Densus Group. ""They need protests on the street to give them cover to move in.” George Floyd protests:How did we get here? Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, without providing specifics, said Saturday he believes 80% of the people now taking part in the overnight rioting are from outside Minnesota. ""There are detractors. There are white supremacists. There are anarchists."" Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said Saturday afternoon. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said protests in the city Tuesday were largely peaceful and organized by local residents, but that the ""dynamic has changed over the last several days."" And St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter originally said all arrests were from out of state, but walked back those statements later Saturday, saying the information he was provided was inaccurate. However, arrest data shows otherwise. The overwhelming majority of people who posted on social media from the precinct fire and those arrested Friday night at the protests in the Twin Cities live in the area, according to USA TODAY's review of police jail records and almost 100,000 tweets. A civil arrest list provided by the public information officer of the St. Paul Police Department shows 12 of the 18 people arrested from Thursday through 6 a.m. Saturday were from Minnesota. Five of them are from St. Paul, three are from Woodbury (part of the Twin Cities metropolitan area), two are from Minneapolis, one is from Mankato and one is from St. Louis Park. Four are from out of state and two did not have cities of residence listed. And the Minneapolis logs show 93 of the 109 people arrested in the city between Thursday night and Saturday morning reside in-state. Read this:Officials blame 'out-of-state' agitators but those at the heart of protests are homegrown Riot, violence, looting: Words matter when talking about race and unrest, experts say Leggat, the security consultant, said intelligence reports from his colleagues indicate most of the hard-core protesters in Minneapolis were far-left or anarchists, and that far-right groups have not yet made a significant appearance. He said looting is typically done by locals – usually people with no criminal record who just get caught up in the moment. But direct conflicts with authorities come from a mix of both locals and outside groups who see these conflicts as a core part of their mission. Many of the anarchists, he said, target banks, chain-type businesses and even luxury cars as symbols of corrupt institutions. He said even a peaceful protest can turn violent if outside agitators decide to participate, hijacking the message. ""The difficulty is that you have no control over who turns up,"" he said. ""If this was to continue to go on, more people will come. And potentially you could have people on the right turning up, which would make things far more complicated. If those guys turn up, they will claim to be there to protect business. But it means the police will have two groups to keep apart. And that uses up a lot of police resources."" Many protesters interviewed by USA TODAY reporters decried the violence, although some said it was a predicable result of generations of anger and suffering. Speaking to a large crowd on Friday afternoon, Minneapolis activist Kon Johnson, 45, said people who have subjugated for so long are finally lashing out. He said the violence has at least gotten the world's attention. “What is it going to take to get people to listen?"" Johnson said. ""They say, 'don’t incite violence,' but no one is listening. What does it take to get them to listen? I mean, do we have to take this to the suburbs? To the capital? What’s it going to take to get them to listen? We can’t keep burning stuff down."" Johnson, an activist and performer, said the arrest of Derek Chauvin, the police officer seen kneeling on Floyd's neck for eight minutes, is a good first step. Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. But he said it's only the first step toward delivering justice to the community. ""I don't want to burn down sh-- either. I don't,"" Johnson said. ""But guess what? It's gonna happen if this fool does not get life in jail."" 8 minutes, 46 seconds and 'inherently dangerous':What's in the criminal complaint in the George Floyd case Professor Pamela Oliver, a sociology expert from the University of Wisconsin-Madison specializing in protests, said politicians sometimes blame outsiders for causing trouble as a way of pretending there's no real problem within a community. That's not what's happening here, she said: Political leaders acknowledge Floyd's death focused sharp attention on longstanding problems. Instead, she said, many Minneapolis residents may see rioting and destruction as a legitimate way to push back on police repression. ""When the police aggressively punish peaceful protest by firing rubber bullets and tear gas, the protesters often escalate their tactics. In contexts in which the police or other authorities have been acting in repressive ways towards communities, there can be a celebratory air when rebellion occurs in what is called a riot,"" she said. ""I have definitely read claims by Minneapolis residents that the police have been so bad that a rebellious response is appropriate."" Many Minneapolis residents appear to be growing weary of the violence and destruction, while still supporting peaceful protests. Clearing rubble from a burned-out Walgreens on Saturday, Daniel Braun, 34, said he was sad to see the damage to his neighborhood. “There’s civil rights and then there’s burning things down,"" said Braun, an attorney. “During the day, everything is peaceful. It’s only at night when things happen. Once night falls, please, go home. When it’s dark out and you’re there, you’re not making anything better.” A protester who has been outside some of the most intense scenes this week – the Minnehaha Mall on the south side on Thursday and Uptown on Friday – said his experiences with riots and protests leads him to believe most violence demonstrators are not from Minneapolis or St. Paul. Arsonists and people breaking into buildings are ""definitely"" not from the neighborhoods they are damaging, Augustine Zion Livingstone said. ""Ain't no black person burning down no damn barbershops in their hood,"" Livingstone, 23, said. ""We're not doing that."" Some locals are participating in looting once buildings have been breached, but he said they're in the minority when compared with peaceful protesters. ""We're not destroying buildings, we're not burning buildings,"" said Livingston, who also was a main speaker during Friday's marches and protests at the Hennepin County Government Center.

Several protesters were arrested and widespread vandalism was reported in the aftermath. By midnight, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department had confirmed one fatality, and said they were investigating ""multiple"" shootings, none of which were officer-involved. Commentary: Indianapolis in troubled times: 'Why are you crying? More: Business leaders call for an end to looting IMPD deemed Downtown unsafe and asked residents to stay away from the area, even as fires continued to burn in the streets, alleys and, in some cases, banks and other businesses. It was a far different scene earlier in the day, when thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully through Downtown streets chanting slogans such as ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No Justice — No Peace."" The Saturday demonstrations followed a tense night Friday in Indianapolis, where crowds of people marched Downtown to protest police shootings, including the killings of Dreasjon Reed in Indianapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville and, most recently, George Floyd in Minneapolis. Police said the protests that started Friday and continued until about 4 a.m. Saturday resulted in 27 arrests and damage to at least 30 business, including a CVS that was looted and sustained fire damage. It's unclear how many arrests were made and businesses damaged Saturday night and into the Sunday morning hours. A peaceful demonstration turns into something else The slow-rolling protest Saturday elicited a mix of cheers and jeers from motorists, bystanders and people watching the action unfold live on social media. Police took a hands off approach until just after sunset, when a confrontation occurred at Market and Alabama streets, where protesters blocked the road in front of a line of squad cars. “This is no longer a lawful assembly. You are subject to arrest,"" an officer told protesters several times over a public address system. Most of the protesters held their position blocking the road. An IndyStar reporter at the scene saw 10 officers and four police cars. Most were wearing gas masks and standing still. One protester threw a water bottle at an officer, and several others followed. Officers then began firing tear gas. Many of the protesters scattered from the area and retreated further back in the streets. At a late night media briefing IMPD Police Chief Randal Taylor condemned the violence and said officers had been working very well with the protest organizers earlier in the day. “Earlier this evening our officers worked to protect our residents’ right to peaceful protests,"" Taylor said in a prepared statement. ""Most of those protesters cooperated and did a fine job. For that, we’re thankful. However, there was a small group of people that escalated to violent acts, including throwing projectiles at officers and breaking windows of government buildings."" He continued: ""Since then, we have seen continued and escalating incidents of violence. This includes shots fired and loss of life. This is not acceptable in this community. This behavior will not be tolerated by IMPD."" Officials urged peaceful assembly In the wake of the conflict and violence less than 24 hours earlier, Gov. Eric Holcomb and Mayor Joe Hogsett issued statements urging those returning Downtown for the two Saturday protests to refrain from violence and vandalism. Hogsett said he also asked organizers to conclude the events by 7 p.m. and encourage participants to leave the Downtown area after that time. It all went according to plan, at least initially. Police said there were no arrests or major issues when the second protest formally ended at 7 p.m. But few in the crowd — a mix of mostly young blacks and whites, many wearing masks — appeared to heed warnings to leave from organizers. Instead the crowd continued to snake through city street north and east of monument circle for nearly two hours before the standoff near the northeast corner of the City-County Building. The feelings of racial injustice fueling the protests extend far beyond Indianapolis and Indiana, said Deziree Walker, a native of Griffith, Indiana, and former IUPUI student who marched with the protesters Saturday. ""Seeing what's been going on for years and years and years, we're tired. We're exhausted,"" she explained. ""We want change. That's why we're here today."" Indy joins cities around the nation The local protests are part of a nationwide eruption of unrest that has drawn throngs of people to the streets in Atlanta, Louisville, Minneapolis and other cities, including outside the White House in Washington, D.C. Some cities have seen five days of protests. In Indianapolis, Taylor said five IMPD vehicles were damaged and three officers and three civilians were injured Friday night and early Saturday morning, including a person who sustained what Taylor characterized as ""severe lacerations"" while kicking glass. As some protesters grew unruly, police in riot gear launched tear gas canisters and shot pepper balls in an effort to break up the crowd. Just after midnight, police said, someone fired shots at a Marion County Sheriff's deputy outside 1 American Square. The deputy was not injured and did not return fire. No suspect has been arrested. Demonstrators returned Downtown Saturday afternoon for the first of two planned protests. As they gathered at the Indiana Convention Center, city workers and private crews hustled to block off several streets and place sheets of plywood over ground-floor windows. Both events Saturday were publicized on social media by local organizers who urged participants to refrain from violence. At 5;30 p.m., a crowd of about 1,000 gathered at the Indiana War Memorial began moving to Monument Circle chanting ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""No justice — No peace"" and ""Hands up — Don't shot."" At the circle, a protester spray-painted BLM, for black lives matter, on the Soldiers and Sailors Monument. Earlier, about 100 demonstrators began gathering around 1 p.m. at the convention center for an event promoted as a show of solidarity with protesters in Minneapolis. It was organized by Indianapolis resident Malik Muhammad. About 50 people from that event moved north to the war memorial for the second protest at 4 p.m. They marched north amid chants of ""What do we want — body cams"" and ""when do we want them — now."" The second protest, which focused on the shooting of Reed, was organized by Indianapolis resident Destiny Brown, an Ohio State University student. She called for the release of an autopsy report and the names of officers involved in the May 6 shooting. ""There has been no justice for his case,"" Brown said through a bullhorn. ""And there will never be justice for his case."" The crowd quickly swelled from a few hundred to an estimated 2,000 or more. Brown said the event, which had been set to end at sunset, or 9:05 p.m., would instead end at 7 p.m. Anything that happens after that, Brown said, is not affiliated with her event. She urged the crowd to remain nonviolent, and warned that IMPD had told her that it could use force to clear the streets after 7 p.m. Brown's message echoed statements earlier Saturday from Gov. Eric Holcomb and Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett. Both issued public statements acknowledging the right to demonstrate, but urging participants to remain peaceful and refrain from vandalism or looting. Hogsett said he met Saturday morning to discuss the protests with representatives of Indy10 Black Lives Matter and the mother of Reed, 21, who was shot and killed by IMPD officers earlier this month after a police chase he recorded on Facebook Live. After exiting his car, police say Reed began to flee on foot, and at some point, they say he fired a weapon. As he ran, the officer first attempted to tase him, then shot. The shooting is under investigated. The mayor said he made commitments to ""continued change"" in the areas of community policing, transparency and police accountability, including implementing body cameras and a new use-of-force review board. ""We must do a better job of listening and acting before black communities in our city feel helpless,"" he said. Hogsett added he hoped demonstrations would conclude by 7 p.m. The mayor said he asked the organizers to instruct demonstrators to return to their homes at that time. ""I will not deny your anger, for it is fairly earned,"" he said. ""But it is my sincere belief that in moments of anger, we all as humans have a fundamental choice: the choice between love or hate. Indianapolis, it is my hope that as you gather in anger, you will leave your peaceful protest and return home by choosing love."" The Mayor took to Twitter at 1:30 a.m. on Sunday morning to condemn the violence. ""This afternoon, our city hosted a successful protest that allowed hundreds to lift up their cause and have their voices safely heard,"" Hogsett's social media post said. ""Since it ended, a small group of people have chosen to diminish that activism through inexcusable violence. It is unacceptable, and it must stop."" The Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce also issued a statement calling for an end to the violence. ""The opportunity to succeed is central to the growth of Indianapolis, and significant barriers including systemic racism threaten this opportunity,"" said CEO Michael Huber. ""We recognize the longstanding anger and frustration that has been building in our city and our nation in response to violent acts against communities of color, and we support peaceful protests that address this injustice and call for change. When reactions turn violent, however, they not only detract from this call, they undermine the important message of the protests, and shift the focus to destruction and injury.""

1621558266,2020-05-31 08:13:03,"Tense moments, broken curfew mark third night of Breonna Taylor protests in Louisville",http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625681156/0/courierjournal/home~Tense-moments-broken-curfew-mark-third-night-of-Breonna-Taylor-protests-in-Louisville/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — After two nights of destructive and sometimes violent protests, a dusk-to-dawn curfew took effect Saturday evening as the Kentucky National Guard helped patrol Louisville's streets, aiming to restore order and curb vandalism from protesters angry about the police shooting of an unarmed black woman. The March death of Breonna Taylor in her apartment during a police raid has now triggered three nights of protests, with vandals and looters sweeping through downtown Friday. Protests on Saturday evening were largely more peaceful, although skirmishes with police still unfolded. Rooftop sharpshooters watched protesters below at Jefferson Square before law enforcement fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The curfew took effect at 9 p.m., but police in riot gear faced off with demonstrators well after midnight in the Highlands. In a late-evening media briefing, Mayor Greg Fischer said police made ""about 10 arrests."" Read more: At least 5 of 6 protesters arrested in Louisville demonstrations Friday were locals While Louisville grabbed national headlines Thursday and Friday, other cities around the country were in Saturday's spotlight. Chaotic, violent and fiery scenes played out in such places as New York City, Los Angeles, Indianapolis, Chicago and Washington, D.C. Protesters' outrage in those cities were fueled largely by the death of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. In Louisville Saturday morning, city officials said the turbulent gatherings of Thursday and Friday — Fischer likened the situation to ""terrorism...on the streets of our city"" — had to stop. ""(Friday was) a very sad night for our city, and as violence has raged across many cities in our country, it has been a sad night for America,"" Fischer said early Saturday morning following a destructive night of protests. ""There does need to be ample recognition of the underlying inequity that causes so much of the frustration that we see in America and in our city. ""But there is no excuse for the destruction of property we've seen (Friday) evening,"" he said. ""This is not protest; it is violence."" To help maintain peace, Gov. Andy Beshear activated the National Guard, with about 350 soldiers arriving in Louisville by Saturday afternoon. ""I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it’s not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear,"" Beshear said. ""But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe.” Louisville woke up Saturday morning to stunning evidence of vandals' hourslong rampage the night before. Destruction was spotted across downtown. Fourth Street Live took the brunt of the looting that started Friday night and continued early Saturday morning. Several bars were broken into and liquor was stolen. T-Mobile on Fourth and Liberty streets was trashed and looted, the alarm still blaring. Shelves and racks were empty where phones and accessories had been stolen. It was hard to find a building not tagged by spray-painted anti-police messages. Downtown was littered with people Saturday morning, walking their dogs, cellphones out, taking photos and surveying the damage. Many shook their heads or volunteered to help sweep away the shattered storefront glass. Graffiti littered the facade of nearly every building. Broken window panes at the Metro Department of Corrections were a reminder of Thursday evening, the first night of protests. Recap: What you may have missed at Saturday's Breonna Taylor protests in Louisville LMPD partitioned off downtown streets where crews were cleaning up Saturday, with people sweeping the shards of glass off of the sidewalk on nearly every block. Juniyah Palmer, Taylor's younger sister, took to social media to denounce the destruction early Saturday morning. ""At this point, y'all are no longer doing this for my sister! You guys are just vandalizing stuff for NO reason!"" she wrote on Facebook. ""Once y'all started vandalism, you took my sister's name out of place! I honestly feel like you guys are disrespecting my family wishes for a safe and NON-VIOLENT protest!"" No one should be surprised by the kinds of unrest we're seeing, Fischer said Saturday afternoon. ""If you feel like you're not being heard, you're going to shout a lot louder, and a lot more emphatically,"" he said. But he also decried the chaos that dominated much of Friday night and was quick to blame it on ""outside agitators"" and ""anarchists"" intent on causing destruction. Six people were arrested, and six police officers were injured. Fischer's order placed all of Louisville Metro on a 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. curfew for Saturday and Sunday nights, preventing residents from being in the streets, parks and other public spaces. Related: Police officers in Louisville smash milk jugs and water bottles at Breonna Taylor protest Protests were fine, the mayor said, but demonstrators need to stop at sunset. ""If you want to help us have a safe city and an orderly city, and a city that can move through this type of heartbreak that we have here locally and around the country as well, please protest peacefully before the curfew goes into effect and then return home and be safe,"" Fischer told The Courier Journal. ""And then, make your voice heard again in a safe way. But once it gets dark, and once the more anarchic element of this starts appearing, people can get caught up in that."" The curfew was to end Sunday morning and be reevaluated Monday morning. In Louisville, Taylor's death was the catalyst for downtown protests. The 26-year-old emergency room tech was at her southwest Louisville apartment when police entered her home on a no-knock search warrant related to a narcotics investigation in the early morning hours of March 13. Officers returned fire after Taylor's boyfriend fired a shot at what he said he believed to be intruders. No drugs were recovered from the apartment. Taylor's death has garnered national attention in recent weeks, alongside other high-profile killings of black Americans — some at the hands of police officers — that have sparked massive demonstrations across the country. He explains: Why isn't Mayor Greg Fischer attending Louisville's Breonna Taylor protests? On Monday, Minneapolis police killed Floyd when an officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. Floyd's death was captured on video and shared widely. The ensuing nights of protests resulted in Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announcing Saturday that he would be ""fully mobilizing"" the state's National Guard. Floyd's death came at a time when many Americans were already outraged over the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, who was jogging in a south Georgia neighborhood when he was shot and killed by white men. In Louisville, protesters carried signs and chanted about both Taylor and Floyd. ""Breonna Taylor! Breonna Taylor! Breonna Taylor!"" hundreds of people shouted at City Hall, their fists hoisted in the air. Thursday's protest began downtown around 5 p.m., just a couple of hours after the public heard the frantic 911 call made by Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, as she lay in the hall of her apartment, struck by at least eight bullets. Seven people were shot during Thursday night's smaller, but still raucous, protest, with two injuries serious enough to require surgery. Police did not fire those shots, LMPD officials said. On Saturday morning, Fischer said ""the tone clearly changed"" Friday night. ""The number of people on our street clearly changed (Friday) night, as well,"" he said. ""This turned from being a peaceful protest into violence and terrorism and looting on the streets of our city."" People returned to Louisville's downtown streets in even larger numbers Friday night. While many remained peaceful, vandals wreaked havoc across much of downtown: windows of office buildings, at least one hotel and restaurants were smashed. Looters sidestepped broken windows and rummaged through the bar area of Eddie Merlot's Prime Aged Beef & Seafood, hauling away armfuls of alcohol. Opinion: When there is a knee on our necks, anger is an act of righteous resistance Throughout the night, Courier Journal reporters and photographers saw canisters of tear gas being fired; heard flash bangs exploding; and spotted numerous fires in trash cans and recycling bins. Shards of glass were everywhere, and anti-police graffiti was spray-painted on buildings and sidewalks. Earlier in the evening, tensions rose as protesters spotted law enforcement officers inside the Hall of Justice. Protesters ripped the American and Kentucky flags from their poles in front of the building, using lighters and alcohol to set them ablaze. Some hurled water bottles and other hard objects at the courthouse windows, splintering the glass. Other panes were smeared with red paint hand prints, made to look like blood. Anthony Davis, a protester on Friday night, said violence was not the goal. ""We don't want to become violent,"" he said. ""Frustration will cause violence to surface. You can't stop that."" Fischer said Saturday night's crowd was ""significantly smaller and easier to manage.” The main flashpoints were downtown and in the Highlands. Fischer said 10 people had been arrested as of 10:30 p.m. and police had confiscated a number of items including long guns and sticks. Asked why police earlier Saturday had destroyed or confiscated stacks of water and milk downtown — stockpiled by protesters to ward off effects of tear gas — Fischer said such stashes had included items including mason jars full of “flammable material” that could have been used against the public or police.

Taylor, a black woman, was fatally shot by police in her home in March. (Michael Clevenger/Courier Journal via AP) LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Looking to defuse anger after gunfire wounded at least seven people at a protest in Louisville, the mother of a black woman killed by police urged protesters Friday to continue demanding justice but do so “without hurting each other.” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor’s mother hours after gunshots erupted during protests late Thursday outside City Hall. One person was in critical condition, Louisville Metro Police said Friday. Mayor Greg Fischer said police officers fired no shots. Instead, they provided aid to the wounded, he said. TV video showed terrified protesters fleeing as gunfire erupted. ADVERTISEMENT With more rallies planned, Taylor’s mother joined the chorus of calls for protests to remain peaceful. In her statement, Tamika Palmer said her daughter — an emergency medical technician — devoted her life to others and the “last thing she’d want right now is any more violence.” “Please keep saying her name,” her statement said. “Please keep demanding justice and accountability, but let’s do it the right way without hurting each other. We can and we will make some real change here. Now is the time. Let’s make it happen, but safely.” On Friday evening, what appeared to be several hundred people gathered downtown for the second night of protests. The crowd briefly blocked traffic near City Hall and chanted, “No justice, no peace.” Protesters carried signs calling for justice for Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, the black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air. Police presence intensified around 9:45 p.m. Friday, as officers in riot gear stood shoulder-to-shoulder moving people down a key street near City Hall, the Courier Journal reported. A police officer was seen on camera during a WAVE-TV broadcast firing what appeared to be pepper bullets directly at the camera crew. “I’m getting shot! I’m getting shot!” WAVE-TV reporter Kaitlin Rust is heard yelling off-camera. She told the indignant anchors int he studio that the crew was behind the line, but police wanted them to move further away. Police spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said no shots had been fired at Friday’s protest as of 10:40 p.m. and no significant injuries had been reported. Two people were arrested. Bracing for more protests, police said they wouldn’t tolerate violence or property destruction. “We value the right to free speech and understand this community has a lot to say right now,” Louisville police Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous said. “We hear you.” But she added that police were prepared to “take whatever action we must to try to ensure no one else is injured during this time of unrest. We ask the community to please voice your opinions in a peaceful way.” Meanwhile, Louisville’s mayor said the use of no-knock warrants by police was being suspended, the latest in a series of policy changes and others actions in response to Taylor’s death. “To the people who gathered downtown last night to protest, and to many more throughout our city and throughout our country who feel angry, hurt, afraid, frustrated, tired and sick of story after story of black lives ending at the hands of law enforcement, I hear you,” Fischer said. ADVERTISEMENT Two people wounded in the gunfire underwent surgery, while five were in good condition, he said. Beshear, speaking on CNN, said Thursday’s protest started peacefully but some people later “turned it into something that it should not have been.” Local Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey termed the protest as “a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed,” the Courier Journal reported. “What I’m seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration.” The Louisville protests followed the release of a 911 call Taylor’s boyfriend made on March 13, moments after the 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door. No drugs were found in the home. Hundreds of demonstrators marched through downtown Louisville, ending in the early hours of Friday as rain poured down. Windows were broken and several vehicles were damaged during the unrest, police said. Shots were fired into government buildings, including police headquarters, they said. Bricks were thrown into buildings and graffiti was splashed in several places, including a firefighter memorial, they said. The police description of the damage made no reference to any looting. Jordan Basham, a 24-year-old white bartender, said she was a few feet from where the people were shot. As people fled in terror, a man she didn’t know pushed her to the ground, told her not to move and used his own body to shield her, she said Friday. Full Coverage: Louisville “I’ll never be able to get that picture out of my mind,” she said. “But I am still very glad that I was there. As long as they’re out there protesting, I’ll be back.” Many protesters wore masks as Kentuckians are strongly urged to follow health guidelines to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Attention on Taylor’s death has intensified since her family sued the police department this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia in February and the recent death of Floyd.",0.0

Well, thank you for coming out this morning. Last night we experienced our third consecutive night of protests in our city in response to the tragic death of Briana Taylor, locally George Floyd in Minneapolis and just the general outrage of Americans toward the injustices of our African American communities. Last night's protests here in Louisville, in tone and in size, was distinctly different from the previous night. The crowd was smaller and more manageable. I want to thank the many Louisville Yin's who respected to 9 p.m. curfew last night and stayed home. You all helped keep your city safe. And for that I say thank you very much. I put the curfew in place in order to give people the opportunity to peacefully protest during the day and preserve the peace at night. And the vast majority of protesters were peaceful and respectful again. Thank you. You set the right tone and the right purpose. And for that I'm very grateful. Overall, last night was a significantly more peaceful protest than what we saw Thursday in Friday night's here. Louisville. I want to thank Governor Andy Bashir for activating the Kentucky National Guard as soon as I asked him to do so, their presence was very helpful. I want to thank all of our law enforcement partners for their assistance. Also a thank Metro's public works, parks and facilities. Further Incredible cleanup job, along with assistance from Jefferson Town and Mayor derive percent ing their public works assets to help this morning. And I appreciate locals who are willing to help with the cleanup, and there will be an opportunity to help later. With that, I will now describe what I know about the incidents. Last night, Ln P D made about 40 arrests related to the protest. More details will be forthcoming later on those arrests. There were several reports of shots fired throughout the evening. Several small fires were lit. Trash can fires with a few more significant fires around the East Broadway quarter, including one vacant building that was badly damaged. Five l MPD officers in the area of Ninth and Broadway were shot at about midnight. We're very fortunate that no one was hit. Three officers were in a car, which was struck by at least one bullet. Another officer was standing outside the car at the time, while 1/5 officer was getting out of another car and felt the bullet was by his head. We saw some incidents of looting and burglaries as the evening went on, not nearly on the scale of what we saw Friday night. But any looting is still unacceptable. Any property damage is unacceptable. And of course, the safety of people is always our number one priority. The folks that were looting are simply criminals who are exploiting a sincere protest over the tragedies of Briana Taylor, George Floyd. All the other issues are countries experiencing. They're using it as a cover to steal from innocent people. Cleanup is underway downtown. Looking ahead to tonight, the plan is still the same as last night. The 9 p.m. To 6:30 a.m. curfew will be in effect, and this is for the safety and protection of the public. I asked Louisville Yin's to show the same restraint and and decency for their city that they showed last night. The curfew will be enforced is needed in acts of violence, destruction and vandalism will not be tolerated again. Thank you to all the civilians who stayed home and thank you to the many protesters who honored Briana Taylor's name and her family's wishes by saying her name and protesting peacefully. Really, their goal is the same as our goal at Metro government to create a city of peace, a city of safety, a city of justice in a city of the quality, a city of equity. That's the city my team and I have been working to build for the past 9.5 years with partners throughout the city, and we will continue to do so. And what these protests, both here and around the country expose is we have a lot of work to do that's quite obvious that work needs to be done together. There were dozens and dozens of cities across America last night on the night before experiencing protests in turmoil. This is an American problem, Louisville problem, a problem throughout all American cities. But it's a problem that I have faith that we can rise to. One of the positive takeaways from these protests is that there is now a broader and well deserved widespread recognition of the injustices in our country, in tremendous, tremendous energy to call them out and take action. That's hopeful news for our city in our country, and this is work that must be done. We must put that energy that we see in these protests toe work every day. It's that type of hard work that is required to result in structural reform that our country so desperately needs. One issue I'd like to address some present have complained. Some president last night have complained. The police used too much force on the other side. Some of our complaining that the police should be using more force if the police used any force and properly. I apologize for that. It is very difficult policing in the midst of the chaos of these protests. But police should be using their training and exercising their best judgment at all times if anybody got caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong use of force. I apologize for that for other folks in the community that are calling for more force, I asked him the recognize. There's a balance we must have here to protect the right of people to protest, to understand the legitimate grievances people have in the difficulty of policing. To provide that balance. Our police here are doing the best job they can under difficult circumstances and the opportunity we have for improvement. We will take that to the protesters, especially the many young people I see in the crowd. Continue to make your voices heard. Please do so peacefully registered to vote, get other people registered to vote. Find a candidate or whatever party whose values reflect yours and work to get them elected. This is how change happens. That's one way to make your voice heard to honor Briana Taylor. I also want to thank Brianna's family for calling for peaceful protest. Toe honor. Briana, Briana tells family, is going through enough pain to see more pain inflicted upon our city is not the family's desire and they deserve better. Please, everybody do so peacefully when you protest toe everybody who's marched peacefully these last few nights and all the folks marching with them not here physically but in spirit. We would welcome your partnership, and we'll be talking about ways we can work together in the coming days into existing initiatives already under way in our city into any new ones that need to be created. We want dialogue turned into positive action. Let's take the energy of this moment and channel that into the ongoing work to make the changes we need to make so that the ideas of equality and justice that are written into our Constitution become riel. Intangible factors in the daily lives of all Americans. Despite all the chaos, destruction, the violence, we have not for gotten about the heart of the protest the pain, frustration and fear locally here, over Briana Daler Briana Taylor's death. And that's what we need to commit to addressing now and together. I like now, too. Introduce our chief of public safety, Amy Hess, who is going to give an update on the an incident at our jail last night. She fest. Thank you, Mayor. Good morning. Last night, approximately 2:30 a.m. At the main jail of Little Metro Department of Corrections, we had a disturbance involving approximately at least 20 inmates. We had about 135 who were on the sixth floor incarcerated there at the time. This incident started in one of the dormitories reserved for maximum security inmates when approximately nine of them picked up a water cooler and broke an interior window that allowed them then to exit onto the walkway, connecting that cell to the other cells or dormitories on the sixth floor. At that point, they were able to use a table to break the windows of the other cells, and we had approximately five of the other dormitories that were then breached. As I said, approximately 20 of the inmates then exited the dormitories or the cells onto the walkway, the interior walkway. And then we're able to access and damage further equipment, chair tables, computer and the interior atrium windows as well. Very quickly. Our special operations response team within the jail was able to get the situation under control, and at that point all of the inmates were returned into secure areas and approximately four of those inmates were seen by medical staff to treat various injuries. Of those 43 were transported two University of Louisville Hospital where they we're seeing for various medical issues and they were all safely returned to custody at the main jail afterwards. None of our jail staff were injured in this incident, and all of those involved have been now placed in other holding facilities within the main jail. Also last night, our total inmate population was 1311. As I said, 135 of those were on the sixth floor involved in which is where this incident happened. And finally, none of these individuals on the sixth floor in this area were involved in the protest related activity from the past several nights. Thank you. Take a question. Sure. Any questions? Okay, with no, I could Sure. We're looking into that. We've had ah total of 47 individuals related to the protest activity over the past several days since Thursday. Of those, 10 of those were arrested on Thursday and Friday and the rest were arrested yesterday and this morning. But we're still looking into, uh, how they listed. And of course, it's self reported where they list their from. So some of them may have provided addresses that are out of town or not. And we're looking into whether or not we can verify that. What type of statement it's too. Yeah, The minimum level of force was used in order to get the situation back under control by our sort team. The various injuries included a shoulder injury, hand injury. I believe we did have one laceration. Um and I believe some bruising as well. So minimal level of force in order to be able to secure those inmates and get them back into custody. Meaning that once that happened and they were back in custody than the individuals or trained, our staff is trained to stop applying force at that time. What is it Depends on how much the person is fighting. So once that person, I were able to gain control of that person. Then you stop. You don't apply force after that person is complying. Once they're compliant, you stop applying force. Yes. As I mentioned, Ah, Our Public Works Department and Parks Department on Facilities Department for all three mornings of have come out very early in the morning to begin the cleanup process. They've done an incredible job. We've also had some citizens assisting. Uh, you know, we asked citizens really to stay away from now. There's a lot of heavy equipment that's doing the cleanup. Ah, lot. A big part of the cleanup has been completed already. So it's important that people see that we have an orderly city. I mean, that's how we're trying to manage this whole thing, and part of that is being a clean city. That's something that we're gonna be working on. There's a lot of people that have said they want to help, and so will be putting together some details about something where we can make that happen. But we just don't have those details yet. We did hear a report of that. We're still looking into it investigating at this time, that's all. Okay, plan to build trust. We're forget. Please response. Generally rebuild trust. Well, the only way to do that is through understanding people's perspectives and what happened to them and understanding what we can do to prevent any type of incident that occurred because of poor training, poor application of force. But you have to respect a white people are out, be what happened to them and where we go from there. I mean, in life, you can never turn the clock back. So how do we move forward together? We've got existing initiatives around this from lean into Louisville initiatives, a synergy initiatives. But these are not issues that can be left undiscussed. So we also need these issues to be respected as legitimate by the people that have grievances as well. So, you know, we look to them to help us in developing structures to address those. But at the end of the day, we have to come together and understanding tellers, perspectives and how to get together go better as a community. So we'll make every attempt to do that. Really working nature materials we're hearing. Yeah, I'm telling the truth as I know the truth, I always have. I always will. If you don't tell the truth, that always comes out as well. Wait. Hold learned that at a very early age, so I realized people might have different sources of information that I have, but I'm telling the truth is, that is I see that in the whole situation is very different. I'm not seeing what other people are seeing, but I'm saying what I believe. The truth is, if I found out later that that wasn't the truth, I will say that as well. Yeah, the I'm at the same location. Uh, the last thing I want be is a distraction toward public safety. Me rolling around in the protest is not gonna help keep people safe. It would be unnecessary distraction. But I'm in the same center monitoring this situation. Being able do briefs like this with you guys letting the police do their job so they don't have to be pulled away to do these kind of briefings. Okay. Thank you all. Stay safe. Careful. Thanks for covering everything. SIGN UP FOR BREAKING NEWS Get local stories sent straight to your inbox as news breaks. Submit Privacy Notice",0.0

Nations around the world have watched in horror at the five days of civil unrest in the United States following the death of a black man being detained by police. But they have not been surprised. Racism-tinged events no longer startle even America's closest allies, though many have watched coverage of the often-violent protests with growing unease. Burning cars and riot police in the U.S. featured on newspaper front pages around the globe Sunday — bumping news of the COVID-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places. George Floyd died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck. It was the latest in a series of deaths of black men and women at the hands of police in America. Thousands gathered in central London on Sunday to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting ""No justice! No peace!"" and waving placards with the words ""How many more?"" at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored U.K. government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn't stop them. Demonstrators then marched to the U.S. Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred sat in the street and waved placards The U.S. Embassy in Berlin was the scene of protests on Saturday evening under the motto: ""Justice for George Floyd."" Police said the gathering, organized through social media, was larger than expected but reported no arrests. Germany's top-selling Bild newspaper on Sunday carried the sensational headline ""This killer-cop set America ablaze"" with an arrow pointing to a photo of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd's death, with his knee on Floyd's neck. The newspaper's story reported ""scenes like out of a civil war."" In Italy, the Corriere della Sera newspaper's senior U.S. correspondent Massimo Gaggi wrote that the reaction to Floyd's killing was ""different"" than previous cases of black Americans killed by police and the ensuring violence. ""There are exasperated black movements that no longer preach nonviolent resistance,"" Gaggi wrote, noting the Minnesota governor's warning that ""anarchist and white supremacy groups are trying to fuel the chaos.'' In countries with authoritarian governments, state-controlled media have been highlighting the chaos and violence of the U.S. demonstrations, in part to undermine American officials' criticism of their own nations. In China, the protests are being viewed through the prism of U.S. government criticism of China's crackdown on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that U.S. officials can now see protests out their own windows: ""I want to ask Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Pompeo: Should Beijing support protests in the U.S., like you glorified rioters in Hong Kong?"" Hua Chunying, a Chinese Foreign ministry spokeswoman, pointed out America's racial unrest by tweeting ""I can't breathe,"" which Floyd said before his death. In Iran, which has violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. One TV anchor discussed ""a horrible scene from New York, where police attacked protesters."" Another state TV message accused U.S. police agencies in Washington of ""setting fire to cars and attacking protesters,"" without offering any evidence. Russia also expressed a lack of shock. ""This incident is far from the first in a series of lawless conduct and unjustified violence from U.S. law enforcement,'' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ""American police commit such high-profile crimes all too often.'' There also have been expressions of solidarity with the demonstrators. Over the weekend, Lebanese anti-government protesters flooded social media with tweets sympathetic to U.S. protesters, using the hashtag #Americarevolts. That's a play on the slogan for Lebanon's protest movement — Lebanon revolts — which erupted on Oct. 17 last year. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #Americanrevolts became the No. 1 trending tag in Lebanon. In another expression of solidarity with American protesters, about 150 people marched through central Jerusalem on Saturday to protest the shooting death by Israeli police of an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man earlier in the day. Israeli police mistakenly suspected that the man, Iyad Halak, was carrying a weapon. When he failed to obey orders to stop, officers opened fire. ___ Associated Press Writers David Rising in Berlin, Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Frances D'Emilio in Rome, Zeina Karam in Beirut and Tia Goldenberg in Jerusalem contributed to this report. ___",0.0
1621624341,2020-05-31 07:35:05,Coronavirus- Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear hanged in effigy during rally,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/24/coronavirus-kentucky-andy-beshear-hanged-effigy-second-amendment/5254349002/,en,False,,658822,State News - United States - Kentucky,http://www.kentucky.statenews.net/,"What started out as a freedom-loving celebration of the Second Amendment ahead of Memorial Day turned into Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear being hanged in effigy and protesters chanting outside the governor’s mansion. The Second Amendment rally, meant to inspire people “about what it really means to be FREE,” according to Take Back Kentucky, attracted at least 100 people to the Kentucky State Capitol in Frankfort on Sunday. It began as a celebration of constitutional rights but turned into a protest of coronavirus restrictions and Beshear’s administration. Protesters toted guns and waved American and “Don’t tread on me” flags. Taps honored the fallen, and flags were given to veterans from all military branches. Tony Wheatley of Constitutional Kentucky, invoking Benjamin Franklin, said, “We have a republic, if we can keep it.” He called on the crowd to recognize their ownership of the Constitution. Pastor Cliff Christman said that law isn’t relative, and to understand the country’s laws, one should understand biblical law. “This has been one of the biggest shams in world history,” Christman said. “Grown men have been hiding in (their) homes nearly wetting their pants over this invisible enemy that nobody sees. Where is it at? Let it come out and face us. I serve the one true and living God who conquers all enemies. Why should we give our freedom and our liberties up for such fear (and) propaganda and all the garbage that is coming out of Frankfort today?” As the rally wound down, organizers led the remaining crowd to the governor’s mansion to try to hand-deliver a request for Beshear to resign. Groups carried signs reading “Abort Beshear from office” and “My rights don’t end where your fear begins” to Beshear’s home and chanted “Come out Andy” and “Resign Andy.” No one came to the door. A few Kentucky State troopers got out of their cars to observe but did not try to stop the crowd. It was not clear whether Beshear was at home at the time. The crowd returned to the capitol, at which time an effigy of Beshear was hung from a tree outside the Capitol while “God Bless the U.S.A.” played over the loudspeaker. A 'tale of two cities' across US:Some embrace reopening amid coronavirus. Others remain wary A man with a 3Percenter band around his arm helped hang the effigy, though Kentucky 3Percenters Inc. State Secretary Patsy Kays Bush said she was against it and didn’t want it to hurt the group’s image. Wheatley, too, said he did not support the effigy. “However,” Bush said, “we’re at the point where rallies and shouting and hollering is just not working anymore.” The effigy bore a sign that read “sic semper tyrannis,” which means “thus always to tyrants.” After hanging for a short time while people snapped photos, it was cut to the ground. The effigy was swiftly condemned by leaders on both sides of the aisle, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""As a strong defender of the First Amendment, I believe Americans have the right to peacefully protest,"" McConnell said on Twitter. ""However, today’s action toward Governor Beshear is unacceptable. There is no place for hate in Kentucky.” Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, also a Republican, called the effigy ""disgusting"" on social media. ""I condemn it wholeheartedly,"" he tweeted. ""The words of John Wilkes Booth have no place in the Party of Lincoln."" Kentucky House Democratic Leader Joni Jenkins, House Democratic Caucus Chair Derrick Graham and House Democratic Whip Angie Hatton issued a joint statement calling the effigy ""beyond reprehensible"" and an ""act that reeks of hate and intimidation.""

1621625741,2020-05-31 11:35:50,"Mayor Fischer: Evening Brought 40 Arrests, Shots Fired At Police, Incident In Jail",https://wfpl.org/mayor-fischer-evening-brought-40-arrests-shots-fired-at-police-incident-in-jail/,en,False,,93009,wfpl.org,http://wfpl.org/#spider,"Mayor Greg Fischer said at a Sunday morning news conference that about 40 people were arrested Saturday night in connection with protests throughout Louisville. Fischer confirmed reports that shots were fired at Ninth and Broadway around midnight, and at least five bullets were fired on LMPD officers — three officers were inside an LMPD vehicle that was hit by a bullet and another officer felt a bullet whizz by his head, Fischer said. Fischer thanked Louisvillians who stayed home, and said he’s heard complaints about too much force used by police as well as not enough force. “If anyone got caught up at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong use of force, I apologize for that,” Fischer said. Public criticism has centered on the mayor’s physical absence from the protests. A common question now is how he will mend broken trust. “The only way to do that is through understanding people’s perspectives and what happened to them and understanding what we can do to prevent any type of incident that occurred because of poor training or application of force,” he said. He mentioned existing programs, such as Lean Into Louisville. “We also need these issues to be respected as legitimate by the people that have grievances as well. So you know, we look to them to help us in developing structures to address those,” he said. “But at the end of the day, we have to come together and understand each other’s perspectives and how to get together and grow better as a community. So we’ll make every attempt to do that.” Another flashpoint has been the administration’s explanations of events that are vague or contrary to available evidence. For example, reporters and observers questioned the police and administration’s explanations of why officers seized and destroyed protesters’ supplies on Saturday before curfew. Fischer said that night police believed there were flammable materials along with milk and water. Police later declined to share details about those materials. “I’m telling the truth as I know the truth. I always have I always will,” he said. “I’m not seeing what other people are seeing, but I’m seeing what I believe the truth is if I find out later that that wasn’t the truth, I will say that as well.” Jail Incident Amy Hess, chief of public safety, said about 20 inmates in the maximum-security section of the jail broke out windows and exited their cells before damaging equipment, chairs and interior windows. “A special operations response team was in the jail and able to get the situation under control,” Hess said. She said four inmates were injured, three of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment. She said the special operations team used a “minimum level of force” to contain the threat, and none of the inmates involved were arrested as part of the demonstrations. Hess told WFPL the motive of the incident is still under investigation. Chaotic Weekend Of Breonna Taylor Protests The first demonstration in Louisville was held Thursday evening, and it was largely peaceful until seven people were shot near Metro Hall as protesters were attempting to flip a police transport vehicle. All survived; police have not yet identified the shooter. On Friday evening, the protests grew larger and chaotic, and dozens of businesses downtown were vandalized and looted. Saturday morning, Fischer issued a new state of emergency, imposed a 9 p.m. curfew and called in the Kentucky National Guard. Last night, at least 33 people were arrested. Christopher 2X Breonna Taylor, 26, was killed on March 13 as LMPD officers executed a “no-knock” search warrant. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he didn’t know the plain-clothes officers were police officers and believed their home was being invaded. He fired a shot, striking an officer in the leg, and the police shot back, killing Taylor. Walker was initially charged with attempting to murder a police officer and first-degree assault, but prosecutors later dropped those charges. The officers involved in the raid are on paid administrative leave. The FBI is investigating Taylor’s death, and Police Chief Steve Conrad announced amid the scrutiny that he will retire in June. Taylor’s shooting death by police is one of several recent instances of police violence that have sparked outrage and protests nationwide this weekend.

Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick announced Friday he will help provide legal assistance to protesters in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd. Violent protests have battered Minneapolis and have spread to cities across the country. Kaepernick, who gained attention when he kneeled during the national anthem before NFL games to protest racial injustice, said the assistance will be provided by his Know Your Rights Camp. ""In fighting for liberation there‘s always retaliation. We must protect our Freedom Fighters,"" Kaepernick tweeted. The Know Your Rights Legal Defense Initiative says it has teamed up with ""top defense lawyers"" in the Minneapolis area to provide legal resources. Protesters torched a Minneapolis police station Thursday that the department was forced to abandon as three days of violent protests spread from Minneapolis to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S over the death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck. Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd's death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. Chauvin, who was later fired, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

As the sun set around 9 p.m., crowds ordered to disperse because of a citywide curfew were hammered with tear gas canisters. People scattered in the streets, some saying, ""Don't shoot"" while trying to duck the gas. Just shy of 10 p.m., between 50 and 100 people had been arrested at Green and Elm in Over-the-Rhine. Just before midnight, a small group gathered at Vine and McMicken but were quickly arrested. When the crowds initially met the police near Downtown around 9, police shouted orders through bullhorns, their words punctuated by the occasional pop of a pepper bullet or flash bang. The escalation Sunday wasn't a surprise to people watching events unfold. It had been clear by early evening that tensions were running high. Police transport arrested protesters by bus. (Photo: Albert Cesare/The Enquirer) Nighttime has been when things intensify, turn ugly. Under the cover of dark, with anonymity almost guaranteed, the protests that began as peaceful have turned violent. The curfew enacted Sunday was in response to bedlam Saturday night, when 110 people were arrested, nearly 80 of them for violating a curfew that affected only a few neighborhoods. Businesses in OTR had windows shattered. Shots were fired toward stores along Calhoun. A bullet hit an officer's helmet. Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley announced the curfew in hopes of curbing what's been happening in the dark, underscoring officials' concerns that the mayhem isn't over. In response, protesters announced they'd regroup outside of City Hall at 9 p.m. – the precise time the curfew took effect, as though challenging police to arrest them. Police seemed ready to oblige, corralling people who refused to disperse into a smaller area of OTR as a helicopter loomed overhead. Dozens of handcuffed protesters were transported on Cincinnati Metro buses, which had stopped running at 9 p.m. to discourage curfew breakers. Prisoners aboard the buses could be heard chanting ""no justice, no peace"" as they were hauled away. Journalists wearing press credentials were repeatedly confronted when recording altercations and arrests. Some were pepper sprayed alongside protesters. Peace seemed precarious all day. Earlier, during much of a march from Inwood Park to City Hall, police sirens served as an unnerving soundtrack beneath chants of ""I can't breathe"" and ""don't shoot."" Heavily armed officers stood silently in front of the City Hall entrance, arranging their police bikes as barricades against the crowd. Protesters carried signs and wore gas masks, apparently anticipating the tear gas. At about 6 p.m., the first arrests were made when four people were handcuffed for refusing to move to the sidewalk and tear gas was deployed. Officers along the route endured heckling from people screaming profane insults, but some in the crowd also yelled for the police to join their march, inviting them to be on the ""same side."" During daylight, the protest's organizers seemed to have a handle on the crowd, encouraging them to move along with yells of ""we come in peace"" through their bullhorns. But that's been the pattern since Friday: Protests begin peacefully with rappers performing and speakers addressing huge crowds. Protesters raise fists in solidarity and cheer at performances. City officials had encouraged that type of gathering. Cincinnati's protests, like so many across the nation in response to the killing of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer, continue to take a violent turn. In Cincinnati on Saturday, the shift happened after 9 p.m. when some protesters, upset by the arrests of two women in the crowd, began throwing debris at officers outside of the District 1 police headquarters. Police pushed the crowd away toward Music Hall and began firing tear gas and bean bag rounds. Soon after midnight, an officer was struck in the helmet by a bullet. The officer wasn't injured. Officials on Sunday said the bullet was fired intentionally, though they didn't say by whom. Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac said Sunday his department was working to put together demographic data of those arrested. According to reports in multiple cities, it's unclear whether the violence has begun with people protesting Floyd's death, with anarchists exploiting the chaos or with police escalating an already tense situation. What's clear is that some city officials in Cincinnati and beyond have expressed sympathy with people upset by Floyd's death, which occurred after an officer kneeled on his neck for nearly 9 minutes in an incident caught on camera. Floyd had gasped for help and said he couldn't breathe, but the officer kept him pinned to the ground. ""I understand their anger,"" Isaac said early Saturday. ""I share that anger with them."" On Sunday at Inwood Park, speakers made clear their concerns are about a pattern of behavior, not only one man's death. Some referenced Sam DuBose, a 43-year-old unarmed African American man killed in Cincinnati in 2015 by a white police officer who stopped DuBose for not having a front license plate. The county prosecuted his killer, former University of Cincinnati Police Officer Ray Tensing, twice, but both trials ended with deadlocked juries. Speakers, getting Sunday's protesters ready to march, urged the crowd to stay peaceful and denounced the destruction and violence that has swept cities nationwide in the past few days. For example, Floyd's death sparked protests in Columbus and Cleveland for which the Ohio National Guard has been deployed to help contain. Cranley said Sunday he's made no request to activate them here. ""The biggest issue here is George Floyd,"" Cranley said. ""I don't want everything else dominating the news this morning to overshadow that."" The curfew that began at 9 p.m. Sunday and is set again for 9 p.m. Monday covers the entire city. Isaac said it'll be a challenge to enforce citywide, but the continued unrest has dictated it. ""In light of what's happening around the city, it's good to be prepared,"" Cranley said. Enquirer reporters Dan Horn, Sarah Brookbank, Sharon Coolidge, Segann March and Scott Wartman contributed.

WASHINGTON — As protests over the death of George Floyd grow in cities across the U.S., government officials have been warning of the ""outsiders"" -- groups of organized rioters they say are flooding into major cities not to call for justice but to cause destruction. But the state and federal officials have offered differing assessments of who the outsiders are. They've blamed left-wing extremists, far-right white nationalists and even suggested the involvement of drug cartels. These leaders have offered little evidence to back up those claims, and the chaos of the protests makes verifying identities and motives exceedingly difficult. Police officers across the country prepared over the weekend for another round of potentially violent clashes in major cities. Some states had even called in the National Guard to aid overwhelmed police. The finger pointing on both sides of the political spectrum is likely to deepen the political divide in the U.S., allowing politicians to advance the theory that aligns with their political view and distract from the underlying frustrations that triggered the protests. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday told reporters he'd heard unconfirmed reports that white supremacists were coming from elsewhere to stoke the violence and that even drug cartels ""are trying to take advantage of the chaos."" John Harrington, the state's commissioner of public safety, later said they had received intel reports on white supremacists. ""But I cannot say that we have confirmed observations of local law enforcement to say that we've seen cells of white supremacists in the area,"" he said Saturday. But federal officials later pointed to ""far left extremist groups."" President Donald Trump alleged the violence was ""being led by Antifa and other radical groups."" Antifa, short for anti-fascists, is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations. Sunday afternoon, President Donald Trump send out a tweet where he wrote simply, ""The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization."" Attorney General William Barr has seemed to echo Trump's assertions, saying the violent incidents in Minneapolis were driven by groups using ""Antifa-like tactics."" Barr vowed that federal prosecutors across the country would use federal riots statutes to charge protesters who cross state lines to participate in violent rioting. A Justice Department spokesperson said the attorney general's assertion was based on information provided from state and local law enforcement agencies, but did not detail what that information entailed. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was even more vague, declining to point to any particular ideology in his assessment. His agency has heard that ""a number of different groups are involved in these whether it's Antifa or it's others, frankly,"" he said. The groups appeared to be organized and using tactics that wouldn't normally happen in peaceful protest, he said, though he didn't elaborate. While the motives behind the violence were unclear, there was firmer evidence that some of the protesters were coming to the demonstrations from outside the urban centers that have been the epicenter of the demonstrations. Some observers believe a move to designate Antifa as a terrorist organization also carries with it some ulterior motives. Journalist Jeremy Scahill tweeted Sunday that Trump's announcement means a ramping up of domestic spying against protesters is on the horizon. In New York City, federal officials were bringing charges against several suspects, including one of two sisters from upstate New York accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail through the back window of a police van in Brooklyn, a law enforcement official said. The initially peaceful demonstrations in New York City over Floyd's death spiraled into chaos as night fell Friday. Protesters confronted police officers, destroying police vehicles and setting fires. In Detroit, 37 of the 60 people who were arrested in overnight protests did not live in the city — and many came from nearby suburbs, police Chief James Craig said Saturday. Although Detroit is about 80% black, many of those arrested were white. ""We support the right to free speech. We support peaceful protests,"" Craig told reporters. ""If you want to disrupt, stay home and disrupt in your own community."" Initially, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said he'd been told all of those arrested in his city Friday were from outside the state. But a spokesman said Saturday night the mayor had later learned more than half are from Minnesota. In Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, 47 of the 57 people arrested in protest incidents through Saturday morning had provided a Minnesota address to authorities, according to Jeremy Zoss, a spokesman for the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office. Carter expressed the opinion of many black activists in the Twin Cities who have expressed disbelief that local residents would destroy their own neighborhoods, burning down essential services and damaging small businesses. And while it was local protesters and groups that staged initial angry, but peaceful, demonstrations, it was agitators from elsewhere that strategically escalated the tension by causing damage and setting fires, they said. Their beliefs were reinforced by the large numbers of white people in the protests in Minneapolis. ""I think about a third of the people are from out of town here to make the city burn,"" said Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage. ""It is just putting black people in a crossfire not just between fascists and anarchists -- but putting us in a crossfire with the national guard."" It's exceedingly difficult in the chaos and dark of the events to prove these claims. The challenge is made harder in the Minnesota protest, where very few arrests were made in the first two nights of unrest. St. Paul arrest records showed 18 people were arrested on charges related to civil unrest from Thursday to early Saturday morning. Of those, only four were from outside the state; two were listed as unknown. Still, some civil rights leaders had a clear message for anyone coming to protest, even those who show up to call for justice for Floyd. ""The moment has passed. Go home, stay away from here. We are a vulnerable population. At the end of that day if black folks can't rebuild then the only thing we've done is build more power for white folks,"" said Terrell. ""You're talking about years, decades of work undone by these groups -- and by the officer."" Trump vowed Saturday that the ""radical left criminals, thugs and others"" would ""not be allowed to set communities ablaze."" ""I will not allow angry mobs to dominate,"" he said. ""Won't happen."" ___",0.0

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — In a press briefing held at the Big Four Bridge Sunday morning, Louisville mayor Greg Fischer spoke on the Justice for Breonna Taylor protest held Saturday night. “Last night’s protest here in Louisville, in tone and in size was distinctly different from the previous night. The crowd was smaller and more manageable. I want to thank Louisvillians who respected the 9p.m. curfew,” Fischer said. He went on to thank protesters by relaying that the message of peacefully protesting echoed sentiments of what the Taylor family has been asking for. “The vast majority of protesters were peaceful and respectful… You set the right tone and the right purpose,” Fischer said. According to the Fischer, LMPD made about 40 arrests last night related to the protest. More details are expected to be released today. Several reports of shots fired throughout the evening were called in as well as several small trashcan fires being lit. Fischer said a few more significant fires around downtown were lit and highlighted a vacant building in the East Broadway corridor that was badly damaged. Shots were fired at five LMPD officers in the area of 9th St. and Broadway. According to Fischer, one of the bullets struck that car that three officers were in. Reports of looting and burglaries were made but he said not on the same scale as seen on Friday night. “Folks that are looting are simply criminals, who are exploiting a sincere protest of the tragedies of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, all of the other issues our country is currently experiencing. They are using it as a cover to steal from innocent people,” Fischer said. When commenting on claims of police allegedly using improper force, Fischer apologized. “Some present last night have complained that police used too much force. On the other side, some have complained that police should use more force. If the police used any force improperly, I apologize for that,"" Fischer said. In reference to people calling for more policing, Fischer asked them to respect the message of th eprotests and to recognize the difficulties of policing during this time. “They’re doing the best job they can under difficult circumstances. Any opportunity we have for improvement we will take that,"" Fischer said. The curfew implemented Saturday morning is still in effect for tonight.

The announcement on Saturday from the nation's eighth-largest retailer came after Target stores in multiple cities became scenes of violence and unrest. Among the stores where aisles were ransacked was a Target in Minneapolis near the city's 3rd police precinct, where the four officers who were fired after Floyd's death worked. The 3rd Precinct police station was damaged by a fire last week. ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country,"" the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement. ""At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores."" A Target spokesperson said that the company is evaluating closures and limiting hours on a store-by-store basis. The majority of stores being closed are located in Minnesota and California, where protests in Los Angeles led the National Guard to be deployed. Stores will also close in Colorado, Illinois, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Despite the violence that has hit its stores, the company has voiced support for demonstrators. ""The murder of George Floyd has unleashed the pent-up pain of years, as have the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote in a public letter on Friday. ""We say their names and hold a too-long list of others in our hearts."" It remains unclear whether the looting at Target stores was committed by demonstrators or whether they were the actions of unaffiliated bad actors. But the ongoing demonstrations have focused scrutiny on Target's past work with law enforcement — including partnerships with agencies in at least 2o cities. In Minneapolis, the company partnered with police on a program that helped install closed-circuit television cameras in the downtown area. A 2010 report released with support from the company said the ""genesis of the program was a widespread feeling some years ago in the city of Minneapolis that the downtown business district was not a pleasant place to work or visit.""

Louisville Courier Journal I spent about nine hours walking nearly nine miles in downtown Louisville Saturday, where the city endured a third night of protests regarding the death of an unarmed black woman. Breonna Taylor died in her apartment in March after being shot by Louisville Metro Police Department. No charges have been made in connection to her death. Part of my assignment was to talk to as many people as possible as protesters marched and vandals and looters swept through the city. I talked to dozens of people, about 50 people who attended — 80% of them being from the Louisville or Lexington area. The rest came from such regional cities as Cincinnati and Indianapolis.

It seemed to be fewer than the estimated 1,000 Saturday night, possibly closer to the 500 the night before. By 10:30 p.m., when Mayor Greg Fischer gave a press conference, they were mostly dispersed from the various pockets where police had pushed them downtown. And a second group of protesters, on Bardstown Road, had dwindled after midnight, although some took to their cars to drive downtown and through The Highlands. Even before the curfew began, police downtown had used tear gas and flash grenades for the third night. By the end, at least 33 people had been arrested, WFPL reported. Louisville was among several cities in national news, as protests broke out in New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Columbus and Indianapolis. Ostensibly, the protesters were rallying against historical, endemic police brutality against Black people. In Louisville, the main focus was on getting justice for 26-year-old Breonna Taylor, an ER tech who was shot to death in her home after police entered in the early morning with a no-knock warrant. They suspected a drug dealer had delivered a package there. No drugs were found, and the suspected dealer had already been arrested elsewhere. Gov. Andy Beshear had activated about 350 National Guard to aid Louisville police in an attempt to cut down on property damage and looting that occurred during Friday night’s protests, which he, Fischer and police have blamed on people from out of town. Fischer claimed that there were people in the crowd asking for directions to “common places that Louisvillians would know about.” Authorities have not offered additional evidence that what Fischer called “anarchists” were involved. The out-of-town influence has become a common refrain. President Trump tweeted: “80% of the RIOTERS in Minneapolis last night were from OUT OF STATE. They are harming businesses (especially African American small businesses), homes, and the community of good, hardworking Minneapolis residents who want peace, equality, and to provide for their families.” And: “It’s ANTIFA and the Radical Left. Don’t lay the blame on others!” Protesters LEO spoke to on Saturday were mixed on whether they thought out-of-town protesters were to blame for the previous evening’s vandalism. “All the people that were smashing windows, and I have a feeling, looting all the shit last night, I feel like a lot of them were from out of town,” said one person downtown who didn’t give his name but said he lived in the Hikes Point neighborhood. He was not at Friday night’s protests, he said, but he thought that the demonstrators in The Highlands must have been locals because they did not vandalize the Bardstown Road businesses and “everybody here loves The Highlands.” Rebecca Hall, 35, also from Hikes Point, said she didn’t know whether there were out of town protesters, but she pointed out that mayors across the country have said the same thing as Fischer. “Even if there are people here that are joining others to protest, I don’t understand why that’s an issue or why that’s even being brought up,” she said. “I feel like rather than accept that there is this many people in the city angry about what’s happening they want to make it seem like this isn’t us that’s angry and this is why this is happening.” Advertisement ACLU-KY Executive Director Michael Aldridge said in a statement: “There are widespread reports and video evidence of Louisville Metro Police and supporting law enforcement agencies repeatedly attacking protesters and press without cause last night in Louisville. Mayor Fischer’s apology this morning and LMPD’s characterization of the incidents as ‘confusion’ last night are not sufficient to address the shocking, unjustified use of force against peaceful protesters and the specific targeting of journalists. Law enforcement’s violent actions last night and the lack of any meaningful accountability for those actions so far today are at the core of why thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand justice for Breonna Taylor and others. Officers swear an oath to serve and protect. Firing tear gas at peaceful protesters before curfew and threatening journalists with arrest falls far short of your responsibilities to the community. We call for the immediate end of the discriminatory, disproportionate application of force and the swift sunset of the broad curfew order.” Earlier in the day Saturday, Beshear called for calm. “We can’t let our streets turn violent,” Beshear said. “Breonna’s sister, Juniyah, has stated violence would disrespect her family’s wishes.” Fischer said that Saturday’s crowds were “significantly smaller” and easier to manage than on Friday when looting and vandalism tore through the downtown. “I want to say thank you to those who peacefully demonstrated today and respected the need for the curfew,” he said. “You’ve helped your city.” But protesters weren’t happy with the city’s extra measures. Hall found them unfair. “I think being so quick to suppress the protest and the anger is sending the wrong message,” she said. “We’re supposed to just accept that change is going to come. And you know, I think, you can mobilize to protect property so quickly, why can’t you mobilize that quickly to protect Black and brown lives?” But, she said she would leave if the situation got dangerous. Another woman at the protests, who had to run away from advancing police before she gave her name, said she understood the mayor’s decision, but that she, too, wanted him to focus on the protesters’ concerns. And Sonya Burton, 43, who traveled from the Fort Knox area to protest, said she thought the mayor’s idea was a good one to prevent evening riots. “But we’ve been here and we’ve been peaceful, and they haven’t been any kinder,” she said. “I mean, they started beating on their shields, and they stole the water, they stole the milk.” While the sun was still up, two plainclothes police officers destroyed milk and water that protesters had stockpiled in the event of tear gas. Fischer later said that the supplies contained materials that would have been harmful to other protesters, including mason jars with flammable materials.",0.0

But a gathering downtown that evening, protesters say, was dispersed by a line of police before 8 p.m., and tear-gassed before 9 p.m. Police were also seen destroying water bottles, milk and other supplies assembled by the crowd. ""There was not a violent tone at all last night,"" said Erica Bowman, 47, from Louisville. ""Nobody was burning anything. None of that was going on. It just got straight aggressive when they showed up at 7 p.m. with riot gear."" I cannot believe what I just witnessed. They pulled up onto the square with a police siren on and did this. #Louisvillepic.twitter.com/65o2lgZCJh — Natalie Neysa Alund (@nataliealund) May 30, 2020 Asked why police pushed back protesters using tear gas, smoke and holding lines prior to 9 p.m., Fischer, during a morning media briefing, did not object to that characterization. He said it was a situation ""where it looked like it was going to be taking a turn for the worse,"" and that police used their judgment. Fischer, comparing the downtown protests to another on Bardstown Road, said it was different ""in terms of the feeling of the activity from protesters."" LMPD Maj. Paul Humphrey said Sunday evening during a press briefing that police began to see violent crimes before curfew and manufactured chemical bombs. But protesters say there was no violence or looting prior to the police action. Charles Booker, a state representative running for U.S. Senate, tweeted a video at 8:52 p.m. showing a cloud drifting down the street and armed officers holding shields and batons. ""We were yards away. No one was confrontational. It was not 9p. They started throwing gas at us anyway,"" the tweet said. ""I wish I could say this was unbelievable."" We were yards away. No one was confrontational. It was not 9p. They started throwing gas at us anyway.  I wish I could say this is unbelievable. pic.twitter.com/WExdPRmHqx — Charles Booker (@Booker4KY) May 31, 2020 And Jacob Bush, a protester, said officers were pushing the crowd with batons and using some kind of spray to get people moving west more quickly, beginning roughly between 7 and 8 p.m. ""The mayor and the governor, they're always talking about, 'We want to support peaceful protests before the curfew, and we want people to make their voice heard in a productive way,'"" Bush said. ""I thought it was really interesting that they would be as aggressive. ... I was still sitting and thinking, like, what the heck was that about, man? Like, what was the purpose?"" Throngs of protesters have crowded Louisville streets since Thursday, demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old unarmed black woman who was shot and killed by police on March 13 in her Louisville apartment. Officers entered her apartment serving a ""no-knock"" warrant in connection with a narcotics investigation. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired a shot as police entered and struck an officer. He's said he didn't realize they were police. Taylor was shot at least eight times by police in the ensuing gunfire. Young people who have protested in Louisville streets in recent days say they're gathering to call for change, describing the terror of knowing that, as a black person, they could become ""another statistic"" or ""another funeral."" 'A traumatized generation': Louisville's youth demand racial justice during mass protests But on Friday, some of the people downtown turned to property damage and looting after night fell, prompting Fischer to declare a curfew and call in the National Guard. He's alleged that much of the events of Friday night were caused by out-of-town ""anarchists,"" although arrest records show all six of those arrested during that protest were from Louisville. When protesters gathered Saturday evening downtown, some laid in the street or held their hands above their heads, chanting, said Garrett Allen, 29, from Bowling Green, who drove to Louisville to hand out supplies to protesters and didn't take part in the demonstrations. He said what he witnessed was peaceful, until police began strategically dispersing the crowd. Bowman, who attended Saturday's protest with her 16-year-old daughter, questioned the mayor's justification for the police tactics breaking up the gathering. People had their hands up or were laying on the ground, she said. There was nothing aggressive to the level of Friday night's looting or burning. If the administration isn't portraying a peaceful protest as such, Bowman said, it makes her worried about how they're handling cases of greater importance, like Taylor's. ""That's where the rub is, where the distrust is,"" she said. ""And it continues to build in the community. We talk about justice, and there seems to be a disconnect with the type of justice that's given."" ""It's swift for us, and then here comes the tanks and other stuff, but we have to wait for justice for Breonna, or a report, or other things. It sends a mixed message,"" she added.

U.S. law allows terrorist designations for foreign groups since belonging to those groups doesn't enjoy the same protections. Antifa, short for anti-fascists, describes a broad group of people whose positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across. Typically, groups who identify as Antifa are amorphous and don't have a central leadership, though some local activists are highly organized, according to federal law enforcement officials. That has made it difficult for U.S. law enforcement to deal with violence from members of groups that label themselves as Antifa. Federal law enforcement officials told CNN they are aware of outside groups who are behind some of the property destruction and violence, using the cover of the legitimate protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere. Those domestic extremist groups include anarchists, white supremacists and far-left extremists, some of whom have overlapping affiliations.An announcement by the Justice Department on Sunday to use Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country to investigate some of the violence in major cities singles out leftist Antifa activity, though U.S. law enforcement officials say there are groups from both the extremist left and right involved in the riots and attacks on police. In response to the president's tweet, ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi said there is ""no legal authority for designating a domestic group"" as a terrorist organization.""As this tweet demonstrates, terrorism is an inherently political label, easily abused and misused. There is no legal authority for designating a domestic group. Any such designation would raise significant due process and First Amendment concerns.""The Justice Department has studied the issue of creating a domestic terrorism law to apply to people involved in violence and who belong to domestic extremist groups, but the constitutional issues have been a hurdle to that effort.",0.0

Advertisement What is Antifa? Share Shares Copy Link Copy As protests over George Floyd's death spread across the country, officials have blamed the violent nature of some demonstrations on members of a controversial group known as Antifa.President Donald Trump on Sunday said the United States would designate Antifa a terrorist organization, though the federal government has no legal authority to label a wholly domestic group the way it designates foreign terrorist organizations.Speaking at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday, Trump said the recent ""violence and vandalism"" seen across the country ""is being led by Antifa and other radical left-wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down buildings.""The president did not provide any evidence for his assertion.National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien echoed Trump's comments on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday morning, telling Jake Tapper that the violence ""is being driven by Antifa.""CNN has not independently verified whether the group is involved in recent protests.Here's a closer look at Antifa protesters, who have become more visible in the last several years.What is Antifa?Antifa is short for anti-fascists. The term is used to define a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left — often the far left — but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. The group doesn't have an official leader or headquarters, although groups in certain states hold regular meetings.Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across.Scott Crow, a former Antifa organizer, says the ""radical ideals"" promoted by Antifas are starting to be adopted by liberals. ""They would never have looked at (those ideals) before, because they saw us as the enemy as much as the right-wingers.""The majority of Antifa members don't fall into a stereotype. Since the election of President Trump, however, most new Antifa members are young voters.How did the group start?The exact origins of the group are unknown, but Antifa can be traced to Nazi Germany and Anti-Fascist Action, a militant group founded in the 1980s in the United Kingdom.Modern-day Antifa members have become more active in making themselves known at public rallies and within the progressive movement, says Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.""What they're trying to do now is not only become prominent through violence at these high-profile rallies, but also to reach out through small meetings and through social networking to cultivate disenfranchised progressives who heretofore were peaceful,"" Levin said.Where do they protest?Members have been spotted at high-profile, right-wing events across the country.In August 2017 members of the group showed up in Charlottesville, Virginia, to condemn racism and counter protest hundreds of white nationalists opposed to the removal of a Gen. Robert E. Lee statue. The protests turned violent when James Fields, who is not a member of Antifa, plowed his car through a crowd of counter protesters, killing Heather Heyer.Video above: President Trump Says There Were 'Bad Dudes on the Other Side' in CharlottesvilleEarlier that year, Antifa protested the appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos, an alt-right provocateur, at the University of California, Berkeley. They also protested President Trump's inauguration in 2017.While it can be difficult to distinguish Antifa activists from other protesters, some dress head to toe in black. Members call this the ""Black Bloc.""They also wear masks to hide their identities from the police and whomever they are protesting.Why are they controversial?The group is known for causing damage to property during protests. In Berkeley, black-clad protesters wearing masks threw Molotov cocktails and smashed windows at the student union center where the Yiannopoulos event was to be held.Crow, who was involved with Antifa for almost 30 years, said members use violence as a means of self-defense and they believe property destruction does not equate to violence.""There is a place for violence. Is that the world that we want to live in? No. Is it the world we want to inhabit? No. Is it the world we want to create? No. But will we push back? Yes,"" Crow said.Levin said Antifa activists feel the need to partake in violence because ""they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist.""""There's this 'It's going down' mentality and this 'Hit them with your boots' mentality that goes back many decades to confrontations that took place, not only here in the American South, but also in places like Europe,"" he added.White nationalists and other members of the so-called alt-right have denounced members of Antifa, sometimes calling them the ""alt-left."" Many white nationalists from the Charlottesville rallies claimed it was the Antifa groups that led the protests to turn violent.Peter Cvjetanovic, a white nationalist who attended the Virginia protests, said he believes the far left, including Antifa, are ""just as dangerous, if not more dangerous than the right wing could ever be.""""These are people who preach tolerance and love while at the same time threatening people with a different political ideology. We go to our rallies and they harass us and attack us but they held theirs and we ignore them. You don't see right-wing protests get like this,"" Cvjetanovic told KRNV.But Crow said the philosophy of Antifa is based on the idea of direct action. ""The idea in Antifa is that we go where they (right-wingers) go. That hate speech is not free speech. That if you are endangering people with what you say and the actions that are behind them, then you do not have the right to do that.""And so we go to cause conflict, to shut them down where they are, because we don't believe that Nazis or fascists of any stripe should have a mouthpiece.""",0.0

Police custody. The rage out there is predictable. It's understandable, and it's legitimate. Unfortunately, it's being expressed right now over the past week in ways that are destructive. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, praise those who kept their protests peaceful. The raw emotions were on display, and, as I said yesterday, the beautiful expression of solidarity in community that we saw played out by peaceful protestors demonstrations elsewhere Saturday also began peacefully, right. More than two dozen cities nationwide had nighttime curfews in place, and protesters came out anyway, in some cases descending into chaos and destruction. Mayor Kesha Let's bottoms have seen two straight nights of protests in Atlanta. Right now we're talking about cars being burned and businesses being vandalized, and there's still so many issues that are right before us that we've lost. Sign up.

""I've never seen that.""As they knelt, one protester reeled off the names of other black people who had died, including Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery.Even as cities around the country have been rocked for days by violent protests, similar heartening scenes emerged over the weekend. In Florida Saturday, several officers from various agencies knelt with protesters in prayer in front of Coral Gables City Hall.In Oklahoma, photos captured the powerful moment when sheriff's deputies at the Oklahoma County Jail took a knee in solidarity with the protesters. Some officers were also seen talking to and hugging the protesters.In Iowa, Des Moines law enforcement took a knee outside of the Des Moines Police Department with protesters in solidarity.Shortly before 9 p.m. Sunday, protesters asked authorities to kneel with them in solidarity of George Floyd's death. Authorities kneeled with protesters for two minutes. After the moment was done, protesters dispersed from the area for the time being.""We've talked about many times in this building and everybody, every man and woman in the Des Moines Police Department knows what happened up there was wrong,"" said Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert. ""That's not what this is about. We've had a lot of violence. We've had a lot of unrest. But, what we saw tonight was a peaceful protest.""

""Where do you want to walk?

That's the moment I'm looking for.""The NYPD's 103rd Precinct is near where the march was held in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, so police knew about it in advance and were there.A pastor invited the officers to come into the circle of protesters to kneel with them, which was greeted with cheers from the crowd.All of the officers didn't kneel, Abraham said.Abraham said it was very nice of those officers who did kneel, but it was only a start.""I really want to be clear that that's not enough.

Senate hopeful, Rep. Charles Booker also spoke during the event, urging Louisvillians to make their voice heard this election.As of 6 p.m., the 2nd Street Bridge closed due to protesters.Major Humphrey with the LMPD says fireworks are being used as explosive devices, rocks, cinder blocks, & Molotov cocktails have been thrown at officers during the past few days.During a press conference, Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous said LMPD officers tried to disperse the protest before curfew because they were informed of people in the crowd who came to harm police. There were also 40 arrests during Sunday night's protests. On Monday Mayor Fischer plans to hold a ""Day of Reflection"" in Louisville. He will host a virtual gathering at 11:30 a.m. on Facebook with local faith leaders. He will be talking about the events of the last few days.BACKGROUND ON THE CASETaylor, 26, was shot and killed by Louisville Metro Police officers back in March when they executed a search warrant at her apartment.Earlier Thursday afternoon, a 911 call made by Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, was released by her family's attorneys.Commonwealth Attorney Tom Wine said Walker made the call after officers retreated following the gunfire.Walker was initially charged with attempted murder of a police officer after the raid. Officials said he fired first. Walker has said he believed police to be intruders.That charge was dropped last Friday after the prosecutors said they needed more evidence.The FBI and Kentucky Attorney General are now investigating the officers' actions. The officers involved are Sgt. Jon Mattingly, who was shot in the leg during the incident, and Detectives Myles Cosgrove and Brett Hankison.Since the shooting, they have been on administrative reassignment.Protesters WLKY spoke with Thursday said they want to see those officers fired and charged.On Friday, both Fischer and Attorney General Daniel Cameron said these decisions will take time. Fischer said that's in large part due to lack of video.None of the officers were wearing body cameras that night.PROTESTS NATIONWIDETaylor's family is being represented by lawyers who are also representing the family's of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd.Both of their deaths have sparked nationwide outrage recently, as well. Arbery's death seems to have played a part in bringing Taylor's back into the light.Floyd's death led to major unrest in Minneapolis over the last few days. Protesters even torched a police precinct.Then, on Friday, the officer seen kneeling on his neck was arrested and charged with murder in his death.Prior to that announcement, the attorneys discussed all three cases together, calling for a congressional hearing and the creation of a national task force that would create bipartisan legislation aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability.",0.0

Chief of Police Peter Newsham said Sunday that the Metropolitan Police Department had arrested 17 people Saturday night and that 11 MPD officers were injured during the protests. None of the officers sustained life-threatening injuries, though one officer is undergoing surgery for multiple compound fractures to his leg after a protester threw a rock at him. Newsham said that of the 17 people arrested, eight either live in D.C. or have some ties to the area. He said police expect to make more arrests, as the department is asking private businesses to review their security footage, and will ask the D.C. community to help identify those who were damaging property or hurting people.",0.0

Where does the city go from here?",http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625716492/0/courierjournal/home~After-nights-of-protest-Louisville-is-hurting-Where-does-the-city-go-from-here/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Our city is hurting. And it's not just evident in the shattered windows or the dozens of buildings tagged with spray-paint graffiti and anti-police messages. It can be heard in the voices of college students and seasoned activists, of religious leaders and law enforcement, of civic directors and politicians. They all are hurting from the past four days of demonstrations and peaceful protests that turned violent. They acknowledge a deep divide between many of Louisville's black and white residents and communities. And all told The Courier Journal on Sunday it's time for the entire city to acknowledge its issues and forge ahead in unity. But how? And what happens next? Where does Louisville go from here? This is what community leaders, members have to say By about 7 p.m. Sunday, uncertainty lingered in the air. About 1,000 protesters had gathered on various streets and sidewalks downtown, watched closely by city officers, Kentucky State Police and members of the Kentucky National Guard. A rare curfew was to take effect at 9 p.m. and is to end Monday morning. A decision will be made later in the day if it will be extended. Sunday updates: Louisville rallies again after arrests at Saturday Breonna Taylor protests The emotions and frustrations that have been building for weeks in response to the March death of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed black woman killed in a hail of bullets from LMPD, will not evaporate overnight. And while demonstrations are expected to continue with a focus on alleged police brutality and accountability, many community leaders across the civic spectrum say systematic changes — from health care and economic equity to food access and criminal justice fairness — are needed to truly put people of color on equal footing. After four nights of protests that often turned violent — with businesses looted, crowd members shot and tear gas thrown through the streets — The Courier Journal spoke with more than a dozen people about what should happen now that these issues have erupted. The question was simple: Where does Louisville go from here? The answers, of course, are far more difficult. 'Not us versus them' Antigone Mehani said the answer isn't rocket science. The community organizer, who works with immigrants and refugees, said the key to finding a resolution is first listening to and acknowledging the problem. ""That's the reason why we're having this protest happening,"" Mehani said. ""There's been a call but no answer"" from Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and other city officials in regards to starting a conversation about Taylor's death. ""It's not us versus them,"" she added. ""I think that's what's happening right now with our current political leadership. ... They're not acknowledging that it's just 'they,' it's 'us.' This is about our community."" Fischer, at a news conference Sunday, said issues that have arisen after Taylor's death ""cannot be left undiscussed,"" and the city must look to people with grievances to help develop structures that address them. ""But at the end of the day, we have to come together and understand each other's perspective to get better as a community,"" he said. Mehani said finding avenues to come together will be difficult while the city is still in the heat of the moment. It also will be difficult amid the coronavirus pandemic. That global health crisis that has killed at least 104,000 Americans exploded in early March and shut down the region's economy, shuttered businesses, schools and churches and changed lives, thrusting all of us essentially into social isolation. ""I think, unfortunately, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was a perfect storm,"" said Dr. Muhammad Babar, a physician with the University of Louisville. ""Unfortunately, this thing which should have been our first priority, it was on the back burner."" Babar is president of the local nonprofit Doctors for Healthy Communities. And the group has donated supplies and gift cards to Louisville Metro Police during the outbreak. But he disagrees with the department's use of a ""no-knock"" warrant on the night Taylor was killed. And he said it's time to reflect as a city on changing the culture of law enforcement, so that there's a ""relationship of mutual respect between the community and police, rather than this aura of power on one side and aura of helplessness on the other side."" ""If we fail to address these issues in our society, then something else is going to happen in a couple of years, and it will be restarted,"" he said. To begin, Babar and others said, the city needs to create a plan by bringing people of all backgrounds to the same table. Ryan Nichols, president of the River City Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 614, said a partial plan has already been put in place through the creation of a group charged with recommending civilian oversight of LMPD. ""We support productive talks that produce real change, whatever that change needs to be,"" Nichols said. ""As we come together, we can find those answers."" 'Not the time for weakness' The Rev. David Snardon of Joshua Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church isn't as confident that coming together will create longterm change. That's because Fischer and police leaders have not held the department accountable for actions taken in Taylor's death, he said. ""There will be a symbolism of change and transformation that will help defuse the anger of the people,"" Snardon predicted. ""But it won't be enough to really bring about peace. ""If you bring about a solution without ever talking about what was wrong or the confession of the thing, then you're still really hiding the problem."" Read more: Breonna Taylor protesters question police tactics used prior to Louisville's curfew time Voices of the protests: What Breonna Taylor demonstrators are telling our reporters Snardon said it takes courage to tell the truth. ""I don't know if this administration or if people as a whole can stomach the truth,"" he said. ""It's much easier to skip over that and then say, 'We're not going to point fingers, let's just focus on a solution.'"" State Rep. Attica Scott, of Louisville, attended Friday's protest, where she said she was pushed by an LMPD officer and hit with tear gas. The first thing that needs to change, she said at a Sunday news conference, is the city's budget, which is ""heavily weighted toward law enforcement."" ""That means your taxpayer dollars are being given to people who abuse you, who assault you. And we cannot and will not stand for it,"" she said. ""If Mayor Fischer cannot lead the city of Louisville,"" she added, ""he needs to leave his position so someone else can lead us. Because now is not the time for weakness from our elected officials."" 'We can do better' Archbishop Joseph E. Kurtz said the short-term step is to get swift justice for Taylor, a 26-year-old ER technician who was killed in her apartment during a raid. The bigger push — changing hearts — is tougher, he said. That will involve broadening opportunities for young people, strengthening families and battling racism in all its forms. Kurtz said he walked around downtown after the protests and saw the devastation up close. As much as he decries the violence and damage, “I worry that (it) will serve a stumbling block path (to healing and) genuine listening. We have to keep our focus on peaceful demonstrators.” All of what’s happened with the coronavirus crisis and the deaths of Taylor and George Floyd in Minneapolis, he said, should inspire us to ask, “What kind of community do we want to live in? In good times and bad, we have to call out the best in people.” Civic and community leaders agreed, saying there’s no time to waste in acting to address the underlying problems that sparked the four days of violence and destruction. Ed Glasscock, a businessman and lawyer, said the city needs to convene a task force of community and political leaders to evaluate what’s happened here and across the country and devise “recommendations on how we can improve things.” Support local journalism Support stories like this one by becoming a subscriber today!

And Greater Louisville Inc., the metro chamber of commerce, has already begun conversations about how the business community can address the systemic issues that “have brought us to this point,"" said Sarah Davasher-Wisdom, GLI’s president and chief executive officer. Sandra Frazier, a businesswoman and University of Louisville trustee, said this is a moment where people have to ask themselves if they're willing to address the ""urgent and core issues of racial equity in our justice system, education and economy."" “A city which prides itself in unifying city and county government cannot ignore we live in a tale of two cities,"" she said. ""Moving forward, we need to worry less about how our community appears and focus more about changing this reality."" Stephen Reily, director of the Speed Art Museum, said he hopes white community and business leaders step up to that challenge. ""I think it's really important that it start with black voices, but then white voices have to become part of it,"" he said. ""This is not the burden of the black community and black leaders to carry this. ... I want to see more white leaders say, 'This is our job, this is our city.' Say, 'This is the problem, and we can do better.'"" 'There's more work to be done' Before the work can begin, though, several protesters and black activists said there must be time for healing. That's why members of Black Lives Matter Louisville and other local groups joined together Sunday afternoon for a healing ceremony outside the KFC Yum Center, the former site of a slave trading point. “Healing is important because it indicates something has changed,” faith leader John Randolph told a crowd of about 500. “We need something to change in this country, whether it’s law enforcement, whether it’s just the way we do criminal justice or whether it’s how we regard each individual.” Many people are hurting, and their collective response has been from a place of anger and grief, said Quintez Brown, a University of Louisville student and Courier Journal contributor. They need to heal now, he said, then find ways to prevent future tragedies. ""This is a system that we're trying to take down,"" said classmate Bayley Amburgey, who graduated in May. ""We have to remember, this is a greater scheme. There's more work to be done."" And everyone needs to play a role. Reporters Kirby Adams, Sarah Ladd and Grace Schneider contributed to this report.

Police custody. The rage out there is predictable. It's understandable, and it's legitimate. Unfortunately, it's being expressed right now over the past week in ways that are destructive. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, praise those who kept their protests peaceful. The raw emotions were on display, and, as I said yesterday, the beautiful expression of solidarity in community that we saw played out by peaceful protestors demonstrations elsewhere Saturday also began peacefully, right. More than two dozen cities nationwide had nighttime curfews in place, and protesters came out anyway, in some cases descending into chaos and destruction.

It's unclear if First Lady Melania Trump and Barron Trump were also taken down with him.Trump has repeatedly praised the Secret Service for its handling of the protests outside the White House Friday night in the wake of George Floyd's death last week in Minneapolis.The New York Times first reported Trump was taken to the bunker.The decision to physically move the president came as protesters confronted Secret Service officers outside the White House for hours on Friday — shouting, throwing water bottles and other objects at the line of officers, and attempting to break through the metal barriers.At times, the crowd would remove the metal barriers and begin pushing up against the officers and their riot shields. The Secret Service continually replaced the barriers throughout the night as protesters wrestled them away.Protesters pushed hard enough a few times that officers had to walk away with what appeared to be minor injuries. At one point, the agents responded to aggressive pushing and yelling by using pepper spray on the protesters.Throughout the night, protesters could be heard chanting their support for Floyd, an unarmed black man who died last week after being pinned down by a white police officer, and their dislike of Trump. The protest, which began around 10 p.m. ET, Friday night outside the White House, had mostly quieted down by 3:30 a.m. ET, Saturday morning.The crowd thinned out and Secret Service officers were able to expand their perimeter and barriers around Lafayette Park across from the White House.Six arrests were made during the protests, the Secret Service confirmed in a statement Saturday afternoon.The president on Thursday had used the threat of police retaliation and military intervention in Minnesota where protests turned violent and destructive — saying on Twitter that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""Trump's tweets on Saturday also invoked imagery tied to brutal civil rights-era police tactics.Now, a serious divide has emerged among the President's top allies and advisers over how the president should address several nights of protests and riots.Trump is being urged by some advisers to formally address the nation and call for calm, while others have said he should condemn the rioting and looting more forcefully or risk losing middle-of-the-road voters in November, according to several sources familiar with the deliberations.",0.0

Paul Humphrey said in a media briefing Sunday evening that the protests are now “a riot,” and anyone out demonstrating tonight should expect a similar law enforcement presence to last night. The city is under a 9 p.m. curfew. Humphrey said the protests are no longer peaceful once protesters are violating the law — including breaking the curfew. “When you violate the law to make a statement, it puts people in danger and we have to take steps to stop that,” Humphrey said. Humphrey said protesters have been using explosives like Molotov cocktails and fireworks against the police, and that officers have to defend themselves and the public when that happens. In response to questions about whether officers should be warning protesters before deploying chemical agents like tear gas and pepper balls, Humphrey said the warning comes when police issue a declaration of an unlawful assembly and tell the crowd to disperse. “Unfortunately, these situations are very chaotic,” Humphrey said. “Individual orders are very difficult to put out. Officers are wearing gas masks, there are a lot of people out there, there’s a lot of violence.” “That order to disperse is that warning.” Humphrey also addressed questions about police officers who confiscated water bottles and milk jugs from a protester supply pile on Saturday. He said the water and jugs are not simply supplies — they’re tools for violence. Milk is used to dampen the effects of the tear gas, which is used to disperse the crowd, he said. “If it was here for protesters expressing their rights peacefully, we’d provide them water and make sure they’re taken care of,” Humphrey said. “It’s used for refreshing people so that they can go back out and continue violence. We’re not going to allow that happen. We’re not just taking milk. We’re also taking bats, rocks and weapons they’re using as well.” Mayor Calls For ‘Day Of Reflection’ Christopher 2X Fischer asked protesters to stay home tonight and join him tomorrow in a virtual gathering at 11:30 a.m. to honor Breonna Taylor, whose March shooting death by LMPD officers was the impetus for this week’s demonstrations. Fischer said the day was originally planned to honor those lost to coronavirus, but he also wants to acknowledge all those grieving now for Taylor, George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery, among other Black people killed in recent weeks. Fischer praised a Black Lives Matter protest held Sunday afternoon and said law enforcement will continue techniques that allow them to identify and arrest those violating curfew and inciting problems. He also apologized to any peaceful protesters who were harmed by pepper spray and other police action, noting there’s “no upside” for the city to take willful moves against peaceful protesters. “The people who are here to peacefully protest, we want you here,” Humphrey said. “However, this is now a riot. That’s what it’s turning into everywhere. We ask that you not participate in that, you do not hang around to observe, and you encourage those who are going to participate in it to leave. Stop that criminal behavior.”",0.0

Taylor was shot in her home by Louisville police officers serving a “no-knock” warrant on March 13. The officers have been put on paid administrative leave. Hundreds gathered for a “healing ceremony” hosted by Louisville’s Black Lives Matter on Sunday afternoon outside the Yum! Center in the city’s downtown. Keturah Herron, an organizer with the ACLU of Kentucky, said that the city needs to fire the officers involved in the shooting to begin the healing process. “We have put a lot of demands in. And right now we’ve got our foot on their necks. And we are not going to stop,” Herron said. The group’s organizers are also calling for state and local leaders to pass laws ending “no-knock” warrants. Louisville temporarily banned the practice after outrage sparked by Taylor’s killing. The rally came amid days of protests following the deaths of Taylor and George Floyd, a black man brutally killed by police outside of Minneapolis last week. Following nights of vandalism, Fischer imposed a 9 p.m. until 6:30 am curfew, which has been enforced by the National Guard, Kentucky State Police and local police patrolling downtown Louisville. Law enforcement has been firing teargas and pepper-filled pellets against protesters — actions that have drawn scrutiny and criticism from witnesses who say they have been retaliated against without warning for protesting peacefully. State Rep. Charles Booker, a Democrat from Louisville who is running for U.S. Senate, called for police to join protesters in condemning police violence. “We pay for your jobs. We are your family, too,” Booker said. “Instead of being adversarial, instead of being confrontational and lining up like you’re going to beat us up over the head, lock arms up with us, demand accountability from your colleagues in law enforcement.” This post has been updated.",0.0

The demonstrators were protesting the killing of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor in March by Louisville police, as well as other police killings of Black people like George Floyd in Minneapolis. In the early evening Sunday, protesters moved between Broadway and Jefferson Square Park, occasionally blocking traffic. They chanted “hands up, don’t shoot,” while surrounded by about a hundred Kentucky State Police troopers in riot gear. Kentucky National Guard Humvees were present as well, and helicopters hovered overhead. Around 8 p.m., protesters on bullhorns urged people with children under 12 to leave before the city’s curfew. Others appeared prepared to stay. The police declared the gathering an “unlawful assembly,” and around 8:20 p.m. tear gas filled the air. At a briefing around 10:45 p.m., Mayor Greg Fischer accompanied by LMPD assistant chief of police LaVita Chavous addressed the question of why law enforcement began pushing back protesters with smoke and tear gas before the 9 p.m. curfew. According to Chavous, law enforcement could deem the demonstration an “unlawful assembly” prior to curfew because the demonstrators didn’t have a permit and were blocking street access. She claimed that “people that were infiltrating the crowd for their own agenda.” “We have allowed the no-street access simply to be accommodating to people and allow them to voice their opinions and views in a positive and peaceful way,” she said. “But I want you to know that LMPD could have legally taken those steps a lot earlier than we did. And it wasn’t until we became concerned for the safety of the community and the safety of our officers that we declared it to be an unlawful gathering.” She said police witnessed people in the crowd with weapons, specifically leaf blowers and umbrellas that she said, “are oftentimes used to blow back chemicals into the police face, or to blow back the gas chemicals that we may use in an effort so that they can continue to be out there protesting and causing problems.” On Twitter, Louisville Metro Council member Bill Hollander pushed back on some of Chavous’ comments. “We can’t tell people to protest peacefully and, after the fact, say we can gas you anytime if you don’t have a permit,” Hollander tweeted. “The public deserves an investigation and report from an independent oversight system it can trust.” https://twitter.com/BillHollander/status/1267296987340328960 During the 10:45 p.m. briefing Chavous said they had, at that point, made more than 40 arrests.",0.0

Lafayette Park, near the White House, quickly became the scene of multiple fires that included a car. The Washington DC police also said there were reports of break-ins at two Target stores in the area. Social media posts also showed graffiti on buildings and fireworks being set off just before the curfew took hold and well after it became official. USA TODAY confirmed that an American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) building was set on fire and vandalized Sunday night. The DC Fire and EMS Department tweeted about responding to that fire and a reported basement fire at the historic Saint John's Church near the White House. The department tweeted that both fires were extinguished. The late-night events come after a day of demonstrating at the nation's capital near the as part of the nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd. ""There's been way too many lives taken by police,"" said Travis Sinclair, 29, Silver Spring, Md., a salesman at a private equity firm. ""And there's been little or no action taken against them ... They can't just keep killing people."" Like others, Sinclair called for changes to the criminal justice system to handle cases against police officers who wield deadly force. For example, he called for the prosecution of Minneapolis officers who were seen standing around as a colleague had his knee on Floyd's neck. ""Arrest, Charge & Convict The Accomplices,"" said a sign carried by Sinclair. Among other signs in the crowd: ""Being Black Shouldn't Be a Death Sentence"" and ""Abolish Qualified Immunity."" Demonstrators said they came to the area near the White House to try and deliver a message to Trump personally, though they doubted he would be interested in heeding it. ""He hasn't done anything for us,"" Sinclair said, citing issues ranging from police brutality to the coronavirus pandemic. ""He hasn't done anything for anybody ... Look at this crisis."" As maintenance workers swept up shards of glass near the White House early Sunday, hours after protesters smashed windows and set buildings and cars on fire, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said members of law enforcement would work to quell the unrest that defined the demonstrations night before. ""We're sending a very clear message to people that they have a right to exercise their First Amendment rights but not to destroy our city,"" she told NBC News' ""Meet the Press."" ""We saw a level of destruction and mayhem among some that was maddening."" Jumana Ayni, 22, who attended the protest with her mother and a friend, said the damage caused at the end of Saturday's protest was done by some who attended the protest for the ""wrong reasons."" ""I feel like it's a distraction,"" she said as a group of young protesters sprayed graffiti on the sidewalk behind her. ""You have some people who come out and get mixed up with those of us who are here to fight for justice, and they're just here for the wrong reasons."" For a moment on Sunday afternoon, tensions appeared to abate as hundreds of protesters took a knee and raised their fist in a moment of silence. But it wasn't long before members of the crowd stormed through security barriers that lined the entrance of Lafayette Park. One protester began spraying graffiti on a sidewalk inside the park, daring the approaching police officers, dressed in riot gear. As the swelling crowd moved further into the park, police at times dispersed pepper spray. By Sunday night, Mayor Bowser imposed an 11 p.m. curfew and activated the National Guard. Cocoa Taylor, 40, a self-described worker who drove to the protest from Woodbridge, Va., said Trump may not listen to calls for justice, but others might. She also said many police departments may change because of the fallout from Floyd's death. ""Maybe because the light is being shined so brightly this time, they will try,"" Taylor said. ""Hopefully, they'll try."" Chikondi Kulemeka, 23, a food company employee who lives in College Park, Md., was handing out water, snacks, sun screen and PPE masks to demonstrators, hoping to keep their energy to deliver their message. ""When I came here Friday night, I came to talk to Trump,"" she said. ""Today, I came down here to support my protesters."" Washington D.C. police arrested 17 people after protests Saturday night. The majority of those arrested were charged with rioting, while three were charged with burglary and simple assault, authorities said Sunday. Dozens of officers, mostly Secret Service personnel, were injured. Unrest in D.C.:Protests over George Floyd escalate near White House, around DC as Trump warns against 'mob violence' Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department Chief Peter Newsham said “agitators” threw bricks, bottles and incendiary devices at police officers. Many looted and vandalized businesses in the downtown area. 'An enormous red flag':After George Floyd's death, some call for a broader federal investigation Eleven police officers were injured. One officer suffered multiple compound fractures to his leg after he was hit with a brick near Lafayette Park. The officer was undergoing surgery Sunday. Separately, the U.S. Secret Service said more than 60 uniformed officers and special agents were injured this weekend. Some were assaulted – “kicked, punched and exposed to bodily fluids,” officials said. Eleven were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. The Secret Service has arrested seven people near Pennsylvania Avenue since demonstrations began Friday. Officials said protesters vandalized six Secret Service vehicles, repeatedly tried to knock over security barriers, and threw bricks, rocks, bottles, fireworks and other items at Secret Service personnel.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — They say a photo speaks a thousand words. What would three photos say? “At first, they were pulling him to response and the officer was outnumbered really bad,” Chris Williams said. “We were like, scoot back bro – and the people were marching with their kind of linked arms all the way around him.” Thursday night, Louisville watched as peaceful protests turned violent. Shots rang out and started a movement many were not ready for. Thursday turned into Friday and Friday turned into Saturday. Protestors, rioters, looters, filled the streets, breaking store windows, harassing news crews and squaring off with officers. Williams was among the crowd, amid violence, protesting for his rights, and the rights of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and every black and brown American’s rights. He’s seen linked arm-in-arm protecting an officer separated from his squad. He said he’d talked to the officer but didn’t remember his name. One day later, he helped news crews get to safety. “At this point, I’m not telling people to do anything – like I’m mad but I still got common sense to not have someone get hurt because they’re doing their job,” he said. It’s not his job to tell someone how to protest, Chris says, but to him, it's brick by brick we'll lay a foundation for dialogue.  “People are saying this is getting lost in the looting but people are still coming out here every day so it has to mean something.” Contact reporter Paulina Bucka at pbucka@whas11.com.

Protests have been sparked in Cincinnati and nationwide after George Floyd, a black man died Monday in Minneapolis, after a white police officer kneeled on his neck, ignoring Floyd's pleas that he could not breathe. (Photo: Albert Cesare / The Enquirer) Cincinnati need not waste this opportunity to move from rhetoric to results in the quest for racial equity. The NAACP has heard from many of our allies during this most recent period of national focus on racial oppression and inequity. They insist they want to help make real change. We welcome them, one and all. However, the time has come for them to be consistently visible and vocal for the long haul, not just until the fires quell and the pandemic scare subsides. We need modern-day abolitionists. Black Cincinnati has been patient with structures and systems that do not serve us well, especially structures largely controlled by those least impacted by the decisions they make or actions they take. Black Cincinnatians have long been on life support and in a state of emergency. We suffer from the systemic poverty rate, low-wage-paying jobs, poor health outcomes, a lack of true quality and truly affordable housing, a judicial system that has two scales of justice depending on your complexion. We struggle against the lack of meaningful cooperation from the city to implement the more than three dozen recommendations for refreshing the Collaborative Agreement and to work jointly with the community on problem-solving strategies, social service agencies that perpetuate the cliff effect, sorely lacking investments in our youth and a public-school district with pockets of largely under resourced segregated schools. While COVID-19 has shone a light on and amplified racial disparities for many across our community, it is hardly an epiphany to the black community, because it is our lived experience. The stress, trauma and terror evoked by this structural breakdown can be felt in the images of George Floyd begging for his life and crying out to his mother, as police took his life right before our very eyes and murdered him in a horrific and heartbreaking way. Now, as we hold our collective breath (we can't breathe) for justice to be served, the pain and rage is felt nationwide because we have been let down time and time again by a system that has consistently left us empty and angry because of no real accountability or transparency. Across the country through protest and unrest, the language of the unheard has broken out, including in Cincinnati, as a sign of solidarity. This is a long-standing battle in America, but it is not new to the NAACP. As the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights organization, it was founded partly in response to the 1908 race riot in Springfield, Illinois, spurred by the arrest of two black men for alleged crimes against white people. When the men were secretly transferred to a jail in another city, a white mob burned down 40 homes in Springfield’s black residential area, looted local businesses and murdered two African American residents. Shortly thereafter, black and white activists met in New York City and organized the NAACP to promote equal rights and eradicate racial prejudice, including white progressives Mary White Ovington, Henry Moskowitz, William English Walling and Oswald Garrison Villard, along with notable African Americans, W.E.B. Du Bois, Ida Wells-Barnett, Archibald Grimke, and Mary Church Terrell. Joe Martini, of Delhi, participates in protests in Cincinnati Sunday, May 29, 2020. Across the country, people have been outraged by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police. (Photo: Liz Dufour/The Enquirer) Among their allies were veterans of civil rights groups, suffragists, social workers, labor reformers, philanthropists, political activists of all persuasions, educators, clergy, and journalists – many with roots in abolitionism. In the steadfast determination of the anti-slavery tradition, they planned to fight the new color-caste system with a ""new abolitionist movement."" The Cincinnati NAACP chapter was established in 1915 and over the decades has remained committed to this fight for justice. COVID-19 and the tragic murder of George Floyd have broadcast the clarion call for a new corps of modern-day abolitionists. Will you answer the call, one and all, and join us in this fight?

(Photo: Cara Owsley/The Enquirer) Cincinnati leaders were concerned that weekend protests in the city would be hijacked by outside agitators. However, records from Saturday's unrest show the vast majority of those arrested were local, young, committed minor infractions and were black and white. Police arrested 111 people Saturday night and early Sunday as crowds roved the city – most peacefully protesting police brutality in the aftermath of Minneapolis police killing George Floyd, a suspect in custody, on May 25. The incident has sparked violent protests across the nation. More: More than 200 arrested in weekend protests to be in court Monday The Enquirer on Sunday combed through arrest records of people booked into the jail Saturday night. Among those arrested: There was a racial mix: 56 were white, 51 black, one Asian and three undisclosed 56 were white, 51 black, one Asian and three undisclosed They were young: The median age was 23; 63 of those arrested were in their 20s, 20 were under 20 and only seven were 50 or older The median age was 23; 63 of those arrested were in their 20s, 20 were under 20 and only seven were 50 or older They were overwhelmingly local: 75 had Cincinnati zip codes, 20 were from Northern Kentucky, a handful of others came from Norwood, Springdale, Amelia and other suburbs. Of the two who came from the furthest away, one was from Trotwood, Ohio, (suburban Dayton) and one came from Cynthiana, Kentucky (suburban Lexington). 75 had Cincinnati zip codes, 20 were from Northern Kentucky, a handful of others came from Norwood, Springdale, Amelia and other suburbs. Of the two who came from the furthest away, one was from Trotwood, Ohio, (suburban Dayton) and one came from Cynthiana, Kentucky (suburban Lexington). They were mostly small-time: 69 were charged with violating the curfew, 14 for failing to disperse, there were six counts of disorderly conduct, six counts of obstructing police business, two counts of criminal trespassing, one count of vandalism and one of aggravated menacing (making threats). 69 were charged with violating the curfew, 14 for failing to disperse, there were six counts of disorderly conduct, six counts of obstructing police business, two counts of criminal trespassing, one count of vandalism and one of aggravated menacing (making threats). There were a handful of more serious charges: Five counts of misdemeanor arson, three counts of breaking and entering and one count of assault against a police officer. After some disorderly conduct Friday night, Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley put in place a 10 p.m. curfew for Saturday night for the Downtown Central Business District, Over-the-Rhine, Pendleton and the West End. There was a 9 p.m. curfew Sunday. That would allow officers to make arrests on a charge of misconduct in an emergency, a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Cranley, at a Sunday morning press conference, hadn't been briefed on the arrests but expressed concern outsiders might be playing a role. ""I don't know the answer as to where they are from, from their appearance, but a lot of them have backpacks and I don't know why if you lived in this city, you would need a backpack, if you were intending to go home or if you were traveling long distance, but that is speculation,"" Cranley said. He noted many of the arrests from Saturday night were of white people. He saw some of the arrests himself. ""We were at Liberty at Vine (streets), where a number of arrests were made for a curfew violation and I will point out ... at least from the moment I was there and watching it ... I believe every person arrested was white,"" Cranley said. I ""just believe these kinds of facts have got to get out there."" At the same conference, Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac said not all those arrested were city residents, but he didn't elaborate. “Everyone from that crowd was not from Cincinnati. It is not uncommon for people to come from other places,"" he said. ""We’re monitoring that. We do not have any info that there is an organized effort.” For those arrested, arraignments are set for Monday morning. Judge Alan Triggs, a Democrat, is presiding over arraignment court this week. As of Sunday night there were 91 cases on the docket, but that number is likely to grow, said Ray Faller, Hamilton County Public Defender. More arrests were made Sunday night. Faller expects people to be cited to court, or given low bonds, considering the Hamilton County jail officials are cognizant of keeping the inmate court low during the coronavirus pandemic. Typically Faller keeps six public defenders on hand, but he's doubling that for Monday. Everyone without an attorney, who qualifies as indigent, will be given one. ""We'll run straight though the cases until we're done,"" Faller said. More: A list of downtown locations that sustained damage during protests Friday and Saturday Cincinnati Vice Mayor Christopher Smitherman said the charges may almost all be misdemeanors, but the arrests are serious and should be treated that way. ""Because of the destruction we had with property, particularly with the backdrop of COVID-19, with business owners almost destroyed, there needs to be justice,"" Smitherman said. ""These people were part of that narrative. The reality is we have to hold them accountable – there were businesses that were looted – whether it was City Gear or whether it was BlaCk Coffee. Those small businesses owners deserve an answer."" He said he hopes Hamilton County judges will understand the impact this has had on the city economy and businesses affected. ""This is a very expensive endeavor,"" Smitherman said. Reporter Cameron Knight contributed to this report.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — At Jefferson Square Park early Sunday evening, police surrounded the perimeter while protestors made their voices heard. It’s a different scene from the chaos Louisville sees when the sun goes down. “A very peaceful protest which is certainly every one of our rights to do in this country, turned into criminal acts and became a riot,” described Greg Gitschier, a police chaplain and former Louisville Metro Police officer. He said he’s watched the progression of how police have responded to violence over the last few days. “It’s very difficult for a police officer to take all that verbal and physical abuse and not being able to react in a defensive manner,” he explained, speaking from experience. On Thursday night, officers responded with tear gas and pepper balls, but only after gunshots were fired from the crowd. Before that, police did little to engage with protestors. “Once people start seeing people get handcuffed and zip ties all the way, that probably would've put a stop to it right there,” he said. Only three people were arrested Thursday night, and on Friday, the damage and destruction were taken to a new level. Police continued to respond with tear gas and pepper balls, even into Saturday. State Representative Charles Booker said he was hit by the gas despite no aggression from protestors around him. “They have engaged in a very adversarial, confrontational posture, that I think has exacerbated what was before them, a very calm civilized gathering of folks.” Police argued Sunday that they're protecting themselves and others from homemade explosives and rocks being thrown at them and buildings “At the point people commit crimes damage property and make circumstances unsafe we have a responsibility to stop it,” said LMPD’s Paul Humphrey. Ron Jones, a former police officer and current news anchor at WHAS's sister station in Atlanta, said he's seen curfews like the one in Louisville make a significant difference, and it’s led to more arrests. “There’s a zero-tolerance for that type of violence, zero tolerance for that vandalism, and it's okay to protest but when it's time to go home, it's time to go home. If you don’t, you will get arrested.” Gitschier said he hopes faith leaders will do more to help control the crowd as well.

Racial wounds have been ripped open following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in police custody in Minneapolis. The chaotic demonstrations and looting across the country have been blamed on outsiders of various political stripes, particularly ""radical-left"" groups like antifa, which is short for ""anti-fascist."" But the country is at an especially explosive moment, coming in the midst of a pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 and an economic crisis with more than 40 million Americans unemployed — and in an election year no less. There's no telling how this plays out politically in November, with the election now five months away. Anything can happen. Five months ago, after all, the coronavirus was just a ""pneumonia of unknown cause."" President Trump called Floyd's death a ""grave tragedy"" that ""should never have happened."" Those remarks were made at the first launching of American astronauts into space from U.S. soil in almost a decade — what was one of the hopeful bright spots in this country, though it was overshadowed by the violent demonstrations. But once Trump was back on his favorite platform, Twitter, he again inflamed tensions, with machismo and politics at the forefront. He criticized local Democratic officials, saying Minneapolis's mayor, for example, was no ""General Douglas McArthur [sic] or great fighter General George Patton."" He has called demonstrators ""THUGS"" and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — though he later said he didn't use that phrase as a threat. And he has employed violent, tough-guy imagery, alluding to the potential use of ""unlimited"" military power, ""vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons."" Even some Republicans criticized the president's language. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, called the president's tweets ""not constructive"" on Fox News Sunday. And Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told CNN that Trump is ""continuing to escalate the temperature,"" which is the ""opposite"" of what a leader should be doing right now. Meanwhile, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, on Sunday waded into a crucial debate — whether there's ""systemic racism"" in police forces or whether there are just a few ""bad apples."" ""I don't think there's systemic racism"" in law enforcement, O'Brien said on CNN, ""but, you know what, there are some bad apples in there. ... There's no doubt there are some racist police"" but, he said, they're the minority. Americans are divided on their views of police. Back in mid-2017, Gallup found that 54% of Americans have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police. But there were very different views by race. While 61% of whites had that level of confidence in police, just 45% of Hispanics and 30% of blacks did. Confidence in police nosedived among minorities and liberals after the rash of high-profile incidents of black men killed at the hands of police in 2014 and 2015, such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Eric Garner in New York and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Views of the police and law enforcement have become a sharp dividing line by race and party. In 2016, Trump declared himself the ""law and order candidate."" Expect him to try to exploit that again as a wedge issue in an effort to win over moderate whites upset by the video of Floyd's death but disapproving of the violent demonstrations. He said as much Sunday. He called for ""Law & Order in Philadelphia, NOW!"" and announced that the United States would be designating antifa a terrorist organization. Expect presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and other Democrats now to have to answer if they agree or disagree with the antifa designation. Of course, it's also possible that Trump went too far already, something some advisers are privately concerned about, and that his rhetoric could hurt him with independents and suburban women. 5 things to watch this week 1. Trump's response to unrest: How Trump responds this week to the violent demonstrations and race relations in America could be consequential. Will it be Teleprompter Trump or Twitter Trump, or both at the same time once again? Florida Rep. Val Demings, who's on the shortlist to be Joe Biden's presidential running mate, said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: ""If there ever was a time we need leadership in the White House, it is now, to help heal our nation, but I don't know why I would expect this president to do something that he has never done before."" 2. The great American coronavirus experiment: It's the first day of June, and with it, many states are making continued steps into phased reopenings. April and May saw more than 100,000 people die in the U.S. from the coronavirus. Some health experts have warned that a resurgence in cases could take place if Americans don't adhere to strict social distancing, or take other precautions like wear masks. The White House has also said that cases could go down in the warmer summer months. Does that happen? And if so, do Americans get too comfortable and lapse into a false sense of security — only to see a spike in the fall? None of it's clear, but the U.S. is heading into a period of pandemic experimentation with no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus as yet. 3. Could Steve King lose? Steny Hoyer faces challenge: It's hard to believe, but there are elections on Tuesday. Two of the marquee races deal with well-known — and very different — political figures. Controversial Rep. Steve King, with a history of making racist remarks, is in a fight for his political life with state Sen. Randy Feenstra in Iowa's Republican primary. Conservative groups have lined up against King, but he can't be counted out. This district has a long history of voting for him, despite his pariah status within the party. In Maryland, Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, is facing a primary challenge from the left in 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes, inspired by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's unlikely win in New York over Joe Crowley, a former congressional Democratic leader. Iowa, Maryland and several other states, plus Washington, D.C., hold primaries Tuesday. 4. Biden to get closer to officially clinching nomination: Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is on the ballot Tuesday, too. Remember, he still hasn't acquired the delegates needed to officially put him over the top for the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of doing that. With 500 at stake Tuesday, Biden needs 85% of them Tuesday to clinch. That's unlikely, so look at next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote — with their 133 delegates up for grabs — for Biden to hit the magic number of 1,991. (Follow all the math here with the NPR delegate tracker.) 5. Origins of Trump campaign investigation to be probed: In Congress, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is looking into the origins of the FBI's investigation into members of the 2016 Trump campaign. The Senate is also expected to vote on nominations, including for the Treasury Department's inspector general for the pandemic response. And action is possible on changes to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. Last week, the House, nearly unanimously, passed a bill that reduces the percentage of the loans that businesses have to use toward payroll and gives businesses more time to spend the money and to pay the loans back. Flashback quotation: ""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just seen them thrown in, rough. I said, 'Please don't be too nice.' When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head]. Like, 'Don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody, don't hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?'

FBI Louisville, Kentucky State Police and the U.S. Attorney’s Office will investigate the death of a black restaurant owner in Louisville.David McAtee was shot and killed by law enforcement as they broke up a crowd early Monday morning in Louisville, officials said.Steve Conrad, who was LMPD's chief at the time, went to the scene shortly after it happened to give details. He said the incident happened around 12:15 a.m. in the parking lot of Dino's Food Mart, located at 26th and Broadway. We're told McAtee owns a nearby restaurant: Yaya's BBQ.Mayor Greg Fischer called McAtee a wonderful citizen, and said many knew him as ""the BBQ man.""Conrad said LMPD and the National Guard were breaking up a large group at that location when someone fired at them. Law enforcement then returned fire, police said.**WARNING: Gunshots can be heard in the video below. Some viewers may find it disturbing**Police said they have several persons of interest being interviewed and it is still unclear who fired the first shot and who struck McAtee.“It’s very clear that many people do not trust the police. That is an issue we’re going to work on and work through,"" Conrad said during an early morning news conference.Gov. Andy Beshear held a news conference around noon saying to his understanding, there was significant footage of what happened, including from body cameras. He called on all of it to be released quickly.“I’m not asking people to trust our account (of what happened). I want to see the video for ourselves,” Beshear said.It was later learned that none of the LMPD officers present had their cameras activated.LMPD: No body cameras activated during shooting death of David McAteeTwo LMPD officers on the scene who police confirm were involved, Kate Crews and Allen Austin, have been put on administrative leave.

JENNIFER: TH Advertisement National coronavirus updates: Top health officials monitoring nationwide protests in fear of virus spread Share Shares Copy Link Copy The latest:There have been more than 1.9 million coronavirus cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The U.S. death toll has surpassed 110,000 people, according to Hopkins.The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month.New World Health Organization guidance recommends that fabric masks — which can be homemade — be at least three layers.Health officials have raised concern about coronavirus spread as thousands of people are now braving a pandemic to participate in the national protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday it was closely monitoring the demonstrations taking place across the U.S. and warned such gatherings could spur coronavirus transmission. Some states are already seeing upward trends of new cases.For three months, the country passed one grim milestone after the other, hitting 100,000 coronavirus deaths in late May. Public health officials have said without the lockdowns that most states put in place, that death toll could have been significantly higher.As those lockdowns were lifted and other measures were loosened, the CDC and other top health officials urged Americans to use face coverings when they go out and always maintain a distance.But the large protests make it hard to keep the recommended social distancing guidelines and ""may put others at risk,"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.""It is too early to know what, if any, effect these events will have on the federal COVID-19 response. Every local situation is different. State and local officials will make decisions to protect public health and safety based on circumstances on the ground,"" she said.Earlier this month, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said protesters should be evaluated and tested for the virus.""I do think there is a potential, unfortunately, for this to be a seeding event,"" he said — especially in metropolitan areas where there has been significant transmission.So far, more than 1,942,000 people have been infected in the U.S., and at least 110,514 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Some states see rise in new casesWhile the early parts of the outbreak in the country hit dense metropolitan areas on the coast the hardest — including California and New York — the past few weeks have seen wider spread in inland states, including Arkansas, Texas and Arizona.In Harris County, Texas, health officials said they identified a nursing home with both cases of the virus and deaths.On Friday, health officials in Utah said they were ""very concerned"" about the rise in new cases over the past week.The state has recorded more than 12,000 infections, according to Johns Hopkins.""When you're away from home, please avoid close contact with others, and wear a mask when other social distancing measures aren't feasible,"" the Utah Department of Health said on Twitter. Utah State Rep. Suzanne Harrison called the spike of cases ""very concerning (and) approaching exponential.""""Today's 18.5% positive test rate is double yesterday's (9.4%),"" she tweeted over the weekend. ""Please be careful. Practice social distancing. Avoid crowds. Use masks where appropriate. Wash your hands.""Several universities have also reported new cases within their athletic programs — including Arkansas State, Auburn University and Oklahoma State University.An important drug could run out Meanwhile, as officials emphasize the U.S. is not yet out of the woods, a government official gave a stark warning. The U.S. government's current supply of remdesivir, the only drug known to work against coronavirus, will run out at the end of the month, Dr. Robert Kadlec, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.The government's last shipment of the drug will go out the week of June 29. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, is ramping up to make more, but it's unclear how much will be available this summer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for remdesivir last month. The drug, an intravenous antiviral medication studied to treat Ebola, is now used on hospitalized Covid patients. A study has shown it helps cut down the length of hospital stays.The government has been working to help Gilead ""with some of their supply chain challenges in terms of raw materials and being able to accelerate the process,"" Kadlec said.""Whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,"" he said.",0.0

At least 40 people were arrested, and the headlines of the evening will shape the way another week in Louisville begins. Our photographers and reporters were in the streets again to document what happened — here's a quick look at both the tense and touching moments that what went down in the Bluegrass State. Police didn't waste much time breaking up Sunday night's largest gathering. An estimated 1,000 protesters came together before 8 p.m. at Jefferson Square Park, at Sixth and Jefferson streets, which was also the site of the largest gathering on Thursday. They marched there after meeting at the Muhammad Ali Center and coursing through downtown, blocking traffic on Broadway at one point and chanting ""Breonna Taylor"" in front of Metro Corrections. Taylor, a 26-year-old African American ER tech, was unarmed when she was shot March 13 as police executed a ""no-knock"" search warrant at her Louisville apartment. The scene at Jefferson Square on sunday didn't last until the 9 p.m. curfew that Mayor Greg Fischer announced in the wake of violent protests and looting on Friday. Police rolled into the area and announced that they would be breaking up the demonstration because it was an ""unlawful assembly."" Minutes later, they shot flash bangs and tear gas into the crowd, scattering the protesters onto nearby streets. 'We need to heal': Black Lives Matter holds 'Healing Ceremony' in downtown Louisville Read more: Breonna Taylor protesters question police tactics used prior to Louisville's curfew time Louisville Metro Police Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous later defended the decision to break up the protest. Those in attendance did not have a permit, she said, and were blocking traffic. Chavous also blamed ""anarchists"" who had ""infiltrated"" the crowd with the intent of causing chaos. At a 10:45 p.m. press conference held by the mayor, Chavous also addressed claims that protesters were fired upon because they were carrying leaf blowers with bleach to shoot at police. Leaf blowers, Chavous said, can be used to ""blow back chemicals into police’s faces or blow back the gas, chemicals that we may use in an effort so that they can continue to be out there protesting and causing problems."" At least two leaf blowers were seen in the crowd she said. ""We assume that they weren’t going to blow leaves, and so we assume that those leaf blowers were for something to hurt us,"" she said. Chavous also called out those who had brought umbrellas, which she said ""can be used as weapons."" CLOSE Protests over the death of Breonna Taylor continued in Louisville on Sunday, with continued tense interactions between police and demonstrators. Louisville Courier Journal Louisville Metro Councilman Bill Hollander called for an investigation into the tactics police used over the weekend. On Saturday, police were seen on video destroying water bottles and milk gallons that belonged to protesters. Fischer said demonstrators had brought ""mason jars full of flammable material"" along with the other liquids. A police officer also was caught on camera Friday aiming and firing pepper balls at a WAVE 3 reporter and camera operator. (Chavous on Sunday said that officer had been identified and reassigned pending an investigation.) You can't tell people they're allowed to protest peacefully, Hollander said in a Twitter post, and then ""after the fact, say we can gas you anytime if you don’t have a permit. The public deserves an investigation & report-from an independent oversight system it can trust."" Many constituents have similar concerns. We can’t tell people to protest peacefully and, after the fact, say we can gas you anytime if you don’t have a permit. The public deserves an investigation & report-from an independent oversight system it can trust. https://t.co/ipVV0N8k5W — Bill Hollander (@BillHollander) June 1, 2020 Still, despite some heavy headlines, there were moments of compassion amid the disarray. A 38-second video shared by VICE News reporter Roberto Ferdman on Twitter made the rounds, showing a presumed protester hugging an officer in SWAT gear. She just went in for the hug, and the officer accepted. Lasted almost a minute.

(Photo: Courtesy of Kailani Koenig / NBC News) And at a protest in Lexington, officers at one point knelt with demonstrators in a show of solidarity that attracted national attention. On Monday, Fischer called for a ""day of reflection."" He said he would host a Facebook Live video at 11:30 a.m. with faith leaders from across the region. One of the purposes of the call, he said, will be to mourn those who have died in the coronavirus pandemic — ""that's one of my worries about all these people being together,"" Fischer added. A decision on whether to institute another curfew, he said, would come later in the day. Lucas Aulbach can be reached at laulbach@courier-journal.com, 502-582-4649 or on Twitter @LucasAulbach.

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, for example, warned that ""if you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week.” As of early Monday, the virus had killed more than 104,000 in the U.S. and more than 372,000 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

Italy welcoming back tourists; Europe slowly reopens The Colosseum in Rome reopened Monday as Italy, the first European country to lock down, continues to slowly ease its social distancing measures and eyes a return of some tourists later this week. Starting Wednesday, Italy will allow travelers from the 25 other members of the Schengen visa-free travel area that covers much of Europe to come to Italy with no restrictions. But few are expecting large numbers to arrive – at least at first. Rome, which is home to nearly 3 million permanent residents, is hardly a ghost town, though. Kids kick soccer balls between the pillars of the ancient portico of the Pantheon, dog walkers circle Piazza Navona’s oval track, solitary pedestrians emerge from the shadows of majestic palaces, and tiny flowers sprout through the cobblestones of Campo de' Fiori. Elsewhere in Europe, Spain reported no deaths in a 24-hour period from the virus for the first time since March. Greece lifted lockdown measures Monday for hotels, campsites, open-air cinemas, golf courses and public swimming pools. The Netherlands reopened museums, and England saw some elementary classes return. – Eric J. Lyman, Special to USA TODAY Busy hurricane season + coronavirus pandemic = 'a cataclysmic scenario' Thanks to COVID-19, the hurricane season that officially starts Monday will be unlike any other. ""The combination of an ongoing pandemic and what NOAA has forecast to be a busy hurricane season is a cataclysmic scenario,"" according to the disaster policy group SmarterSafer Coalition. Federal forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last month predicted as many as 19 named storms would form, of which as many as 10 will be hurricanes. It's just one of many forecasts that predict an unusually busy season in 2020. Even without the pandemic, this ""would be a challenging hurricane season,"" said Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists, because of the predicted number of storms. ""As a nation, we're not prepared, and this is putting people's lives at risk."" – Doyle Rice, USA TODAY Latino homes report serious COVID-19 symptoms nearly twice as often A sweeping national survey believed to be the largest measurement of symptoms of COVID-19 has exposed a staggering ethnic divide as Hispanic are hit hard by the new virus. Since March, 1.6 million people have answered the basic question: Is anyone in your home experiencing symptoms ranging from a dry cough to difficulty breathing? Across the nation, Hispanic households said yes to symptoms of COVID-19 – the lung disease caused by the virus – nearly a third more often than others, a USA TODAY analysis found. When the list is narrowed to what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently identified as the most serious pairs of ailments – dry cough and difficulty breathing, or fever and loss of taste or smell – the differences were far starker: Hispanics experienced them almost twice as often. – Kenny Jacoby and Marco della Cava, USA TODAY South Korea case spike sparks alarm South Korea has reported 238 cases of the coronavirus over the past five days, causing some worry as the country has eased social distancing rules, including opening schools. Most of the cases are centered in the Seoul metropolitan area, and hundreds of infections have been linked to nightspots, restaurants and a massive e-commerce warehouse near Seoul. According to the Yonhap News Agency, Monday's 35 new cases is a slight tick down after Thursday saw a two-month high of 75 cases. The news agency reported that some worries have been raised as nearly two dozen cases were traced to 13 small churches in Incheon, west of Seoul, and Gyeonggi Province surrounding the capital. George Floyd protests could spark new coronavirus infections, experts say Civil unrest across the nation fueled by racial injustice is raising fears of new coronavirus infections. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. George Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms warned that ""if you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a COVID test this week.” Bottoms warned that “there is still a pandemic in America that’s killing black and brown people at higher numbers"" than white people. Health experts fear carriers of the virus who have no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place. The merits of the protesters' cause ""doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. – Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY More coronavirus news and information from USA TODAY 24 Hour Fitness reportedly preparing for bankruptcy filing Gym chain 24 Hour Fitness Worldwide is reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy, as retailers and other companies navigate the coronavirus pandemic. According to The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, the company is seeking a loan to allow them to keep operating through a restructuring. The company has more than $1.3 billion in debt after a buyout by AEA Investors and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, reports Bloomberg. Based in California, 24 Hour Fitness Worldwide operates more than 430 clubs across the country. The Journal reports the company plans to close some gyms permanently. In a statement obtained by USA TODAY, 24 Hour Fitness says they look forward to continue reopening clubs nationwide as coronavirus restrictions are lifted. ""We are considering a broad range of options to ensure the long term sustainability and success of 24 Hour Fitness and we are not going to comment publicly on our strategic plans,"" said the company. – Brett Molina, USA TODAY Family of Grand Princess passenger who died of coronavirus files suit against Carnival The family of a California cruise ship passenger who died of the coronavirus has sued Princess Cruises and its parent company in federal court. Ronald Wong, 64, and his wife, Eva, were passengers on the Grand Princess when the ship set sail from San Francisco on Feb. 21. He died in a California hospital a month later after testing positive for coronavirus. Eva Wong tested positive and recovered. According to the complaint, filed last week in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Princess and its parent, Carnival Corp., should have known that a passenger on the ship's prior voyage had the coronavirus. Sixty-two passengers and 1,000 crew members who sailed on the Grand Princess to Mexico stayed on board for the next sailing to Hawaii, according to the complaint. – Curtis Tate, USA TODAY New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signs bill to support families of front-line workers New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Saturday signed a bill into law that creates a death benefit for the families of state and local government workers who have been on the front lines of the state's coronavirus response, according to a statement. Those workers ""gave their lives for us,"" Cuomo said. New York has been the state hardest hit by the coronavirus. On Saturday, Cuomo also confirmed 1,376 new cases of the virus. According to the governor's office, that brings the statewide total to 369,660 confirmed cases. Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

Prior to next week's event, separate memorial services in Minnesota and North Carolina will be held. Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will pay the expenses of all three events after the former boxing champion's offer of assistance was accepted by the family. It was another day of protests accross the country. Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled. Under heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House. Earlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure. The Hennepin County medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. A closer look at some recent developments: George Floyd's funeral will be held on June 9 in Houston, Texas. Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the Memorial Day confrontation was the right thing to do. What we're reading today: How did we get here? A timeline of events leading up to the nationwide outcry against Floyd's death. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Floyd's funeral to be held June 9 in Houston Family attorney Benjamin Crump on Monday said funeral services for Floyd will be held June 9 in Houston. There will be a public viewing next Monday in Texas, Crump said. Crump added there will be two separate memorial services for Floyd. One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Protesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots Calling himself ""your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden. Before Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them. Trump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Family autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide An autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said. The family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene. “What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.” Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. ""The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. ""From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.'' The Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted ""fentanyl intoxication'' and ""recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd. Two Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest. President Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests. Floyd's brother calls for peaceful protests Wearing a mask that read ""We can't breathe'' on one half and ""Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner. Terrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive. ""My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. ""Let's do this another way.'' Floyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote. ""Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. ""Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.'' The crowd, which had earlier chanted, ""Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: ""One down, three to go.'' Though all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Trump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people' President Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” More than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Disturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters The sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic. It's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds. -- Ryan W. Miller Louisville police chief fired after another killing Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew. Police and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a ""large crowd"" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured. -- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal Protests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks Protests can be ""breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19. Focus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" Mina said. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Ken Alltucker and Karen Weintraub Chicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire' Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night. Chicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she ""did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn."" “The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,"" she said. Police chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says George Floyd's death was ""unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries ""that has included institutional racism"" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action ""within their legal authority"" to hold officers accountable. ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now,"" the statement said. ""We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised."" Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday. A weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people have been arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, including Secret Service agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7 p.m. curfew Monday. She said significant damage was done around the White House on Sunday. There was also a fire at the historic St. John's Church across from the White House. – Kevin Johnson In New York: Police cars burn, no curfew planned, mayor's daughter arrested Setting a curfew in New York City to help curb violent protests would be a pointless exercise doomed to failure, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday. Police cars burned and several officers were injured in clashes Sunday night, the fourth consecutive night of violence in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter Chiara was among almost 1,000 people arrested since Thursday, said NYPD officers ""showed restraint"" amid the mayhem. De Blasio also downplayed the value of a curfew. Shea, speaking on the ""Today"" show, said a curfew would be ignored and extremely difficult to enforce. “The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen,"" Shea said. ""And if people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on."" More news about the George Floyd protests Journalists attacked by officers, protesters As protests across the nation turn violent, members of the news media have been caught in the crossfire – or targeted. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. In Iowa on Sunday, police arrested reporter Andrea Sahouri of the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, on charges of failure to disperse while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said targeted attacks on journalists covering the demonstrations ""show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them."" – Lorenzo Reyes 3 dead in confrontations with authorities in Kentucky, Iowa Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear authorized state police to conduct an independent investigation after Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shot a man early Monday. Police Chief Steve Conrad said someone in the group gathered after the 9 p.m. curfew fired at the law enforcement personnel, who returned fire. In Davenport, Iowa, two people were killed in multiple shootings after rioting broke out, the police chief said at a news conference Monday. Chief Paul Sikorski said police responded Sunday night to disturbances near a mall involving 100 vehicles and ""rioters."" Over the next several hours, police responded to dozens of confirmed shots-fired incidents, including one where officers were ambushed and one was shot, Sikorski said. One officer was shot, one officer returned fire and several rounds hit the officers' vehicle. ""They were not like they protests and demonstrations Saturday,"" Sikorski said. ""What we experienced tonight, last night was completely unacceptable and it does not honor the memory of Mr. Floyd."" – Philip Joens, Des Moines Register; Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

David McAtee, known in the Russell neighborhood for his popular barbeque stand outside of Dino's Food Mart, was killed early Monday morning as Louisville Metro Police and National Guard were trying to break up a ""large crowd"" in the parking lot of the mart at West Broadway and 26th Street. He was 53. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the shooting, which will be a joint effort between the FBI Louisville Field Office and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District, federal officials said. More: 5 takeaways from Beshear on fatal shootings of David McAtee, Breonna Taylor in Louisville Hours after the governor publicly asked Louisville officials to release a ""significant"" amount of body camera footage from the incident ""as soon as possible,"" the city announced there wasn't any. Two LMPD officers involved in the shooting either had failed to activate or were not wearing body cameras during the incident, Mayor Greg Fischer told the public Monday night. The mayor also said Monday he fired LMPD Chief Steven Conrad, who announced he would retire at the end of June amid mounting public pressure following the police killing of 26-year-old ER technician Breonna Taylor. ""This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,"" Fischer said. On Monday morning, Conrad told the public that at about 12:15 a.m., someone from the crowd in the Dino's parking lot area at 26th and Broadway shot at authorities. When the police and guardsmen returned fire, they struck McAtee. No one else was injured. 'My son didn't hurt nobody': David McAtee, Louisville business owner, killed by authorities Conrad said it wasn't clear that it was McAtee who fired at officers, but ""several persons of interest"" were being interviewed following the shooting. Surveillance footage and police radio transmissions released by LMPD Monday evening offered no clear-cut answers. However, ""dozens"" of officers were at the scene, according to the recordings. Several protesters and Russell residents there Monday afternoon questioned why so many officers and troops were present in the first place before the shooting. The most significant protest Sunday night was roughly 20 blocks away downtown. Officials haven't said whether the crowd was made up of protesters or customers, and some activists have questioned whether there was a protest there at all. They said they were trying to enforce the curfew and that the site had a history of violent incidents. Acting LMPD Chief Rob Schroeder said the department will review the incident to determine whether any other policy violations occurred, and there ""will be discipline"" for failing to use cameras. ""That is completely unacceptable,"" Schroeder said. ""And there is no excuse for their clear failure to (follow) our policy."" The two LMPD officers involved in the shooting are Katie Crews and Allen Austin, neither of whom have any disciplinary records, according to LMPD. Austin joined in 2016 and Crews in 2018. The names of the National Guard troops have not been released. McAtee's body was at the scene until at least Monday afternoon. A group of LMPD officers in face shields formed a line just behind the crime scene tape, facing neighbors and protesters who came out throughout the day. By evening, there was still a crowd. Several folks gathered across from Dino's said they knew McAtee or have eaten his barbeque. A group of about 100 people lined the sidewalk across the street from the LMPD line throughout the day. Some said they'd been at other protests this weekend, but many said they just lived in the neighborhood. Metro Councilwoman Barbara Sexton Smith said Kentucky State Police was at the scene Monday afternoon, and that their investigations typically take more time. A State Police spokesman hadn't returned a request for comment from The Courier Journal. On Monday afternoon, the Rev. Steve Frank, president of Louisville's Interdenominational Ministerial Coalition, could be seen speaking with McAtee's family across the street from where he was killed. ""(His) mother wants to see her son,"" Frank told The Courier Journal. Carlos ""Bossfam"" Nolen, who often holds promotional events at a bar across from Dino's, said he knew McAtee well. ""This is a strong loss. A lot more would have happened on this corner if he wasn't here,"" Nolen said. ""Time after time I've witnessed him stop the escalation of violence with food."" The shooting outside Dino's Food Mart came after a curfew had taken effect at 9 p.m. Sunday as protests and unrest over the death of Taylor continued. Fischer extended the 9 p.m. through 6:30 a.m. curfew through June 8. On Saturday, Beshear announced that he was sending roughly 350 Kentucky National Guard personnel to Louisville to ""ensure the safety of everybody"" and ""help keep peace."" Although protests in downtown Louisville have started out peaceful each evening, the scenes have turned more chaotic after sunset. Seven people were shot and wounded during Thursday night's protest. Looting, vandalism and damage to physical and private property exploded Friday night. Sunday night had the fewest protesters overall, police said. ""And now our mission is to work fast, to be thorough and to get full results so that this family can have full accountability and the truth,"" Beshear said.

Beshear Provides Update on Fight Against COVID-19 Gov. Beshear also spoke about Louisville protest over Breonna Taylor’s death Visit the Governor’s Facebook page to watch today’s news conference FRANKFORT, Ky. (May 29, 2020) – Gov. Andy Beshear on Friday updated Kentuckians on the fight against the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). “We will get through this together because we understand the different steps that it will take, especially being healthy at work, to make sure that we can reopen, that we can revive our economy, that we can create our economy of the future,” said Gov. Beshear. “We can do this in a way that makes sure we come out stronger than we were going into this pandemic.” The Governor spoke about the Thursday night protest in Louisville over Breonna Taylor’s death. Gov. Beshear and other officials also offered updates about remote driver’s license and I.D. card renewal, Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO) contracts and long-term care facilities. Case information As of 5 p.m. May 29, Gov. Beshear said there were at least 9,464 coronavirus cases in Kentucky, 283 of which were newly confirmed Friday. “Today’s report is up, and up a fair amount, in cases. We’ll have to wait the next couple days to see whether it is just labs getting caught up from the weekend or whether it is in and of itself significant and something we’ll see moving forward,” said Gov. Beshear. “If you look at the last four days on average, it would be 158 cases per day.” Unfortunately, Gov. Beshear reported nine new deaths Friday, raising the total to 418 Kentuckians lost to the virus. The deaths reported Friday include 51-, 74- and 88-year-old men and 70-, 83- and 90-year-old women from Butler County; 64- and 68-year-old men from Gallatin County; and a 55-year-old man from Oldham County. “These are nine families that again need us to light our homes, places of business and places of worship up green for compassion,” said Gov. Beshear. “With the events of the last couple days, compassion is something we ought to have on full display.” At least 3,231 Kentuckians have recovered from the virus.

Louisville protest Today, Gov. Beshear spoke about Thursday night’s protest in Louisville over the shooting death of Breonna Taylor. Previously, he has called for further investigation of her death. Gov. Beshear encouraged all Kentuckians to seek justice peacefully and to listen to the concerns, fears and experiences of black or African-American community members. “This is a very concerning shooting of an EMT, a young woman who worked to save lives of others here in Kentucky,” said Gov. Beshear. “In a broader context, this pandemic we’re facing has laid bare the inequalities that still exist in our society and that many times are fatal.” He commended the protestors for largely following CDC guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19. He also highlighted the disproportionate number of COVID-19 cases and deaths among black or African-American Kentuckians and committed to doing everything he could to reduce health inequality. “While I’m trying to provide the right words, I don’t claim to understand the depths of pain and frustration that I know so many people feel,” Gov. Beshear said. “I can’t. But what I can commit to do is to listen and to do my best. To tell you that I want to move this world into a better place.” Remote driver’s license and I.D. card renewal Today, Transportation Cabinet Secretary Jim Gray signed an executive order temporarily authorizing circuit court clerk offices to process expired driving credential renewals and replacement requests remotely. Cardholders whose operator’s license, permit or identification card was lost or expired between March 1 and June 30, 2020, may apply with their local circuit court clerk to receive a new card in the mail.

Beshear. “The temporary measure will allow contactless service to help minimize crowding and help offices gradually return to full-service operations.” Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO) contracts Gov. Beshear and Cabinet for Health and Family Services Secretary Eric Friedlander today announced the Commonwealth of Kentucky has awarded the state’s Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO) contract to five health care companies that will manage benefits for the state’s Medicaid enrollees. The five companies are Aetna, Humana, Molina Healthcare, UnitedHealthcare and WellCare. Aetna will also serve children in Kentucky SKY, the Medicaid risk-based managed care delivery program for the state foster care program and the Department for Juvenile Justice. “Health care is a basic human right, and ensuring coverage for approximately 90% of Medicaid’s 1.4 million population is of the utmost importance to my administration,” Gov. Beshear said. “The expansion of Medicaid in the commonwealth has been lifesaving for many families who struggled to find and afford coverage. As we move forward, we must continue to provide equal access for every Kentuckian who needs quality care.” For more information, click here. Long-term care facilities Secretary Friedlander said the state has acted swiftly and aggressively when long-term care facilities have been in distress. After testing indicated an outbreak at a Louisville facility over the weekend, state agencies and Louisville Metro worked together to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect the residents and staff at Nazareth Home Clifton. They moved 39 residents who tested positive into local hospitals. “This is an aggressive disease in long-term care. These are our most vulnerable citizens. These are our moms and our dads,” the secretary said. “We are testing over 1,000, sometimes 2,000 folks a day and we’ll continue to do that until we get every last person tested, and that’s our commitment.” He said they have tested about 15,000 residents and staff in long-term care facilities so far and will test another 5,000 to 10,000 next week. By the end of next week, they will have tested residents and staff at 100 facilities. “We have been very aggressive and deliberate,” Secretary Friedlander said. Testing expansion Gov. Beshear continued to urge Kentuckians to get tested for COVID-19. For information on how to register at sites throughout the commonwealth, visit kycovid19.ky.gov. Absentee Ballot Application Portal online Gov. Beshear is encouraging all voters to use a new Absentee Ballot Application Portal now available online. A link to the State Board of Elections’ portal can be found at govoteky.com. He urged everyone who plans to vote in next month’s primary elections to go to the portal and request an absentee mail-in ballot. Today, Gov. Beshear announced that Kentuckians have already made 190,000 requests through the new portal announced a week ago. “It’s not just your duty as an American to fill out the Census, it’s your duty to vote,” said Gov. Beshear. “We have our primary election coming up in June, and there is a safe way for you to do it. Go online and request your absentee ballot.” The total number is well over 200,000 after including counties like Jefferson and Kenton that started their sign-up process earlier. The Governor reminded Kentuckians to please be patient with clerks, as they are working very hard to get ballots out. For those who just registered to vote, it takes a couple of days for their registration to be processed and for them to show up in the system to apply.

Protests continued following the death of George Floyd, who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) PHOTO:AP Photo/John Minchillo US Heads into a New Week Shaken by Violence By The Associated Press WASHINGTON - With cities wounded by days of violent unrest, America headed into a new week with neighborhoods in shambles, urban streets on lockdown and shaken confidence about when leaders would find the answers to control the mayhem amid unrelenting raw emotion over police killings of black people. All of it smashed into a nation already bludgeoned by a death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surging past 100,000 and unemployment that soared to levels not seen since the Great Depression. Sunday capped a tumultuous weekend and month that saw city and state officials deploy thousands of National Guard soldiers, enact strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems. Even with those efforts, many demonstrations erupted into violence as protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized. In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry, leaving shop owners, many of them just ramping up their business again after coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, to clean up their shattered storefronts. In others, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators, while still maintaining a strong presence for security. The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. Floyd's death in Minneapolis came after tensions had already flared after two white men were arrested in May for the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and the Louisville police shooting death of Breonna Taylor in her home in March. The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name.” Tensions rose Sunday outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames. The district's entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for “overwhelming force” against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd's killing. At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn’t be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. “Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.” Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform. In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said t wo officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, and using stun guns on the man and woman inside. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. Scores swarmed into nearby outlet stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. “We’re not done,” said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. ""They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest, but thousands marching on a closed freeway were shaken when a semitrailer rolled into their midst. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from lockdowns brought on by the pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress. The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis. In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems. At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” Among those in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014. “I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said.",0.0

The protests in Cincinnati began Friday after the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African American man who died last week in Minneapolis when an officer held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley declared a curfew will in the city at a news conference Sunday. Cincinnati's curfew, which starts at 9 p.m. and ends at 6 a.m., has been mirrored by neighboring cities. There are curfews in Elmwood Place, St. Bernard and Newport. Sunday protests started around 3 p.m. at Inwood Park. The rally started with a salute and a song about the death of Sam DuBose, who was shot by an officer not far from the park. Protesters yelled ""I can't breathe"" as they walked down Vine Street around 5 p.m. while helicopters flew overhead. Some protesters arrived at City Hall. The protest was nonviolent until around 6:20 p.m., when there were standoffs at City Hall and the courthouse. There was also a confrontation at 12th and Walnut in Over-the-Rhine. Police were trying to move people along and a scuffle broke out when they didn't move quickly enough. Pepper balls were used by police and at least four were attested. Police deployed tear gas at 9 p.m. as the curfew began took effect.

More than 200 people were arrested over the weekend in Cincinnati. Police have said more than 100 people were arrested Sunday night, with at least 100 in Over-the-Rhine, Enquirer media partner Fox19 reported. Charges include misconduct at an emergency, which is the curfew violation, failure to disperse, disorderly conduct and obstruction of official business. Arrest records show that the vast majority of people arrested were young, local, and committed minor infractions. Police arrested 111 people Saturday night and early Sunday. There were a few more serious charges, including arson, breaking and entering and assault against a police officer. Sixty-nine people were charged with violating the curfew. Those arrested were overwhelming from the Cincinnati area. A handful of protesters came from suburbs around the city, but 75 people had Cincinnati ZIP codes and 20 were from Northern Kentucky.

Daugherty said a total of 171 people have been arrested, but they are still counting. They put about 100 in the sally port because there was not enough room in intake, Daugherty said. The sally port is enclosed but open on top. It's normally where deputies can park their vehicles and bring in suspects from outside. More protests scheduled for Monday afternoon A peaceful protest is scheduled for 1 p.m. at the Hamilton County Courthouse on Main Street. “In honor of George we will be kneeling for 10 minutes, the duration of his murder,” organizers said. Protesters in Cincinnati outraged by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police, have taken to the streets in downtown Cincinnati since May 29, 2020. Sunday, May 31, they marched from Inwood Park near University of Cincinnati to downtown Cincinnati. (Photo: Liz Dufour/The Enquirer) Cincinnati Metro suspended after 9 p.m. Cincinnati Metro will not be providing any bus services after 9 p.m. in accordance with the city's 9 p.m. curfew. The suspension is only scheduled for Monday night, but if the city's curfew is extended, Metro's suspension could be as well. Sheriff's office flies ""Thin Blue Line"" flag after American flag was stolen The Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office flew a “Thin Blue Line” flag at the Hamilton County Justice Center on Sunday evening after the American flag was stolen. The flag has been removed and will be replaced with an American Flag in the morning. The flag was raised by deputies to honor the Cincinnati police officer who was shot, according to a tweet from the sheriff’s office.

For millions and millions of outraged Americans, these tragedies do not appear as isolated incidents, but as the latest disturbing chapters in our long, unfinished American struggle to ensure that equal justice under law is not conditional on the color of one’s skin. “I continue to support and demand thorough investigations into Breonna Taylor’s death. I am glad the Louisville Metro Police Department is investigating, I am glad the FBI is involved, and I am glad Attorney General Cameron has announced his office will evaluate what actions may be necessary after all the facts are in hand. Breonna’s family and all Kentuckians deserve truth, accountability, and justice. “Generations of heroes have fought and died to protect Americans’ First Amendment rights to voice their anger and engage in peaceful protest. I have championed these liberties my entire career. Stealing, burning down buildings, attacking law enforcement officers, or laying siege to police precincts is not speech or protest. It is violent crime that victimizes innocent people. “Kentuckians cannot and will not accept violence and chaos on our streets. Seven people were shot in Louisville last night, and according to Mayor Fischer, none of those shots were fired by law enforcement. This senseless behavior has to stop. “Our city, our state, and our country have to pull together. Violence does not make our streets safer. Injustice does not promote justice. Destruction does not build a better society. We will only be able to chart the future we want if we do it together.”",0.0

I POSTED LINKS TO AL Advertisement How to talk to your children about protests and racism Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video may contain images that are offensive. Viewer discretion is advised.As cities and social media explode with anger over the killing of yet another black man at the hands of police, worried parents struggle with how to protect their children from seeing the worst of the violence while simultaneously explaining the ravages of racism.It couldn't have come at a worse time.Sheltering at home for months to avoid the deadly coronavirus, many parents stressed by juggling work and child care from home had eased their restrictions on screen time for their children.Now it's even more likely that kids might find the video of George Floyd, an unarmed and handcuffed black man in Minneapolis, gasping for breath as a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck.Even if they haven't, experts say parents should assume their children are already aware of tragedies like these and their aftermath.""Children and adolescents are experiencing the collateral consequences of the publicized murderers of Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and George Floyd, whether they have a smartphone in their direct possession or not,"" said California pediatrician Dr. Rhea Boyd, who teaches nationally on the relationship between structural racism, inequity and health.""Whether from social media accounts, conversations with peers or caregivers, overheard conversations, or the distress they witness in the faces of those they love, children know what is going on,"" Boyd said. ""And without the guidance and validation of their caregivers, they may be navigating their feelings alone.""Take care of you firstHow can a parent help their child traverse these disturbing times?Let the child's age and level of development guide you, experts say, but first, be sure that you are in the right frame of mind.""A parent's first step is to take care of themselves, their mental health, their emotional health. Put their oxygen mask on first before they put the oxygen mask on their child,"" said Chicago pediatrician Dr. Nia Heard-Garris, who chairs the minority health, equity and inclusion committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).""Vicarious trauma through screens is real, especially for marginalized communities who may have experienced similar actions first-hand,"" said Dr. Jenny Radesky, a developmental behavioral pediatrician who teaches at the University of Michigan.The stress of watching traumatic events on television and smartphones ""lingers within our bodies and minds,"" Radesky added. She suggests parents find ways to channel that energy with positive actions, such as deep breathing and re-grounding exercises, before playing with or talking to your kids.""This doesn't mean letting go of the anger or anxiety, it just means organizing it better so you can think and act more clearly,"" she said.Once a parent is fully available to be a calm, rational voice, ""then you can parse out what's important to pass onto your child so that you're not oversharing information that may further traumatize them or make them feel insecure or unsafe,"" Heard-Garris said.Infants and toddlersWhile children younger than three aren't going to understand what is happening on television, they will be able to pick up on the ""fear, urgency, or anger in people's voices and behaviors,"" Radesky said.At this age, stress shows up in fussy or unregulated behavior. To keep that from occurring, parents should read, listen to or watch the news when the baby isn't physically there.""Watch what you need to stay informed about your community, but then turn it off and do something that makes your family feel connected and whole,"" Radesky said. ""You may need to re-ground yourself or regulate your thoughts and feelings before re-engaging with your kids.""This is the time to begin teaching your child about systemic racism and how to identify and refute it, experts say.Racist stereotypes and bias begin at a shockingly young age.As early as six months, a baby's brain can notice race-based differences, and can internalize racial bias by ages two to four, said Maryland pediatrician Dr. Jacqueline Dougé, who co-authored the AAP's statement on the impact of racism on child and adolescent health.""Learning"" racism is a lot like learning a new language for babies and toddlers, wrote Dougé and California pediatrician Dr. Ashaunta Anderson in a separate commentary. It can happen without parental input, just by the racial stereotypes so prevalent in society.By age 12, many children become set in their beliefs. That gives parents ""a decade to mold the learning process, so that it decreases racial bias and improves cultural understanding,"" they wrote.While helpful for all races, it's especially important for white children to see brown and black kids in a positive light to fight systemic racism, experts say. Books that profile multi-racial characters are an excellent way for parents to do that. And since it's never too early to read to a baby, start right away.Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that rates movies, TV shows, books, apps and other media for parents and schools, has curated a list of 80 books with diverse, multi-cultural characters for preschoolers and older, some of which could easily be suitable for babies and toddlers.""There's also a website called the Brown Bookshelf,"" said Heard-Garris. ""These are books that have, brown and black protagonists who deal at times with tough issues. I think books are really, really fundamental, especially for younger kids.""Preschool and elementary agesThis is the age when kids begin to ask questions on why other people look different than they do.""If your child asks about someone's skin tone, you might say, 'Isn't it wonderful that we are all so different!' You can even hold your arm against theirs to show the differences in skin tones in your family,"" according to Dougé and Anderson.At this age, children will see and absorb disturbing images from protests and riots literally, ""likely focusing on worrying about a burning van or a scary-looking person in a mask,"" Radesky said.Parents should do their best to limit the exposure children this age have to media, whether television, smart phones or tablets, experts say.""This can be done by setting certain times that children can use their devices, co-view the content with their children, find other activities like playing outside, games, cooking together, set rules that kids should use the devices in a common area where parents can check in,"" Dougé said.""These times also provide opportunities for parents to model the behavior they want their kids to follow by also limiting their exposure to media,"" Dougé added.But as Boyd said, children will likely have already overheard adult conversations, or been exposed to what is happening via social media accounts and conversations with friends.""Parents who have not already, should proactively engage their kids around these distressing events,"" Boyd said. ""Ask them what they know and what they've seen. Ask them how they are feeling. Validate their feelings and let them know what you are doing to keep them safe -- be it in your home or your community.""Parents will also need to give their children the broader societal context of racism in order to try to explain the rage of protestors filling the streets of cities across the nation, Radesky said.By doing so, parents can help build empathy and teach perspective-taking, rather than focusing on the child's specific fears.""Instead of focusing on questions the child may have about concrete things, ask them questions like 'How do you think those people were feeling? Do you know why they were angry? What do you do when you feel like something is unfair?' "" Radesky said.""Providing a controlled space to understand what is going on and ways to process it will help children navigate the distressing emotions, helplessness and fear they may be experiencing,"" Boyd said.Age-appropriate books that deal with discrimination and explain feelings from different perspectives are extremely helpful during this time, experts say.""You can also show them videos of peaceful protests from the past, where people were inspired to demand fair treatment,"" said Radesky, while warning that some YouTube videos can contain intense political and disinformation ads occurring before and during videos.""Just skip those and start showing your young kids the Martin Luther King Jr. or other video once the ad has passed,"" Radesky suggested. ""For older children, you can ask them what they think of different ads and whether they're trustworthy.""'The talk'For black families, there is another, more painful necessity at this age, known as ""the talk."" It's a series of ""don'ts"" black families have passed on for generations: Don't resist police. Stay away from bad places. Be respectful to white people and stay away from confrontation with white men, especially police.""We're black folks, so we don't have a choice but to talk about race and talk about racism,"" said Heard-Garris, who has a 7-year-old son. ""So he can tell you probably more eloquently than I can about racism and he's seven.""She recalls with pain when he asked her if he would be the target of police violence at the tender age of four after he heard adults talk about a recent police shooting of an unarmed black man.""He said to me, 'Are police here to help me or do they shoot me? I thought they're supposed to keep me safe. I thought they were supposed to keep us safe.' And he was four,"" she related.""And so we had a long conversation about how police are supposed to keep us safe, and I assured him that as his mom, that's my job. 'My first job is to always keep you safe,' I told him.""""As he grows, I'm going to have to have a more frank conversation that, 'Unfortunately, you're going to do all the right things, but you might not be safe."" And that's going to be a hard day for us.""The recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, an EMT who was killed in March after officers forced their way inside her home; Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old unarmed black man shot while taking a jog in rural Georgia in February; and now George Floyd's death, has many black parents afraid that ""the talk"" may not be enough.""The problem here is systemic racism and disregard for black lives,"" Heard-Garris said. ""And so as a doctor, I don't just treat a patient that has a fever when they have a bacterial infection, right?""I give them antibiotics. I don't just keep giving them Tylenol because that's not going to treat the infection. And I think as a country we need to treat the illness, which is systemic racism.""As Heard-Garris's story illustrates, when to begin ""the talk"" will be unique for each child and family, Boyd said.""For some, it may be earlier than expected, because evidence indicates black children in particular are often perceived as older and less innocent than they are. For black girls, this process of adultification can begin as young as age 5, and for black boys, it can begin by age 10,"" Boyd said.""Beginning 'the talk' with school-aged children can prepare them for these encounters before they occur and equip them with tools that can be life saving,"" Boyd added.As an African-American pediatrician, Boyd discusses the topic often with parents of children in her care. She advises black parents to think of ""the talk"" as more of a process than a singular conversation.""That process may begin with introducing stories through age-appropriate books or films that can generate questions you answer together. Or it can be an ongoing dialogue that is sparked by current events. Just remember to include specific guidance that enables your child to know their rights and the steps they can take to try and stay safe. And always be sure to let your child know it isn't fair they have to learn these lessons so young. But you are teaching then to try to keep them safe,"" Boyd said.White parents can have ""the talk"" too, Boyd said.""It's an important moment to build empathy with your child,"" she said. ""It is also important to highlight the other children who may have fears or concerns related to their safety, and to model and practice 'upstanding' or acting in defense of those around them.""Tweens and teensOf course, tweens and teens will likely be seeing all the coverage of police brutality and protests on their personal smartphones. Most teens get comfort by communicating with their friends on social media, Heard-Garris said. Some teens have even begun participating in online activism.""Online activism is a coping response for some adolescents, especially right now while we're physically distant,"" Heard-Garris said. ""Reposting, retweeting, expressing how they're feeling, chatting with friends has been helpful, sort of an active kind of coping response.""Other teens, especially those that are not of a minority background, so those that are white, are educating themselves about why this is happening, what's the history of our country, what's happening right now. Intellectualizing the issues has been helpful for them to understand this is not just a today problem, this has been going on for years,'"" Heard-Garris said.At this age, kids will be able to think more abstractly about racism, injustice and violent versus peaceful protest and discuss their views with parents, experts say.""Parents can ask their tweens or teens whether they've seen anything online about the riots and protests, what they think, and what about it was upsetting or inspiring,"" Radesky said.As the parent of any teenager will attest, direct questioning of teens often doesn't produce constructive responses.""I dunno,"" is a typical reaction, so Radesky suggests parents also try asking about the types of unfairness kids see or feel in their everyday lives.Parents can also make good use of movies and documentaries that can educate older teens on the history of discrimination. Common Sense Media has lists of movies that discuss racism or inspire kids to ""change the world,"" which can be used to jump start conversations about racism and how they can help fight it, Radesky said.""You don't need to preach to children about what is 'right' or 'wrong,'"" she said. ""It's better to have a conversation where they come to their own understanding and can see things in a larger social context.""Kira Banks, a clinical psychologist whose website ""Raising Equity"" provides free videos and resources on how parents can fight racism and cultivate an open mind in themselves and their kids, suggests parents watch movies like ""13th,"" a powerful look at institutional racism in the justice system that premiered in 2016 to a standing ovation at the New York Film Festival.""Is this a teachable moment? Absolutely. It must be, it has to be,"" Banks said. ""And if a person hasn't done the work to understand the history of racism and discrimination in America, they should do so, and then join us in raising our children to see and disrupt racism, and be the change we want to see.""The work must be done by all social classes and races, experts say, including the most privileged.""White and non-black families should not shield their older children from these images,"" Radesky said. ""We need to engage our children in a conversation about racism, and use these events as a catalyst.""While it is upsetting to watch, we need to sit with that discomfort and teach our families how to channel that energy to work to dismantle the racist structures that exist in our communities.""",0.0

After Metro buses used to haul prisoners, union leader worried drivers will be targeted",http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/625772288/0/cincinnati-home~Youre-putting-our-people-at-risk-After-Metro-buses-used-to-haul-prisoners-union-leader-worried-drivers-will-be-targeted/,en,False,,82890,nky.cincinnati.com,http://nky.cincinnati.com/#spider,"CLOSE After Cincinnati Metro buses were shut down to the general public Sunday night as part of the citywide curfew, several of the buses were later used to transport prisoners arrested as part of the protests. But, the head of the bus drivers’ union says it wasn’t his people driving the buses. And, he wants to make sure people know that so bus drivers aren’t targeted. “We’ve worked with the police for years, but this is like, you’re putting our people at risk,” said Troy Miller, head of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 627. “I’m getting texts from members, members that are worried because they’re concerned they’re going to be targeted on the routes.” Arrested protesters are transported in a Metro Bus on Elm Street in Over-the-Rhine on Sunday, May 31, 2020. This is the third night of protests in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. (Photo: Meg Vogel/ The Enquirer) Cincinnati is heading into its fourth straight day of protests after George Floyd was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer. The protests, like others around the nation, have started peacefully during the day but have turned violent after dark, with protesters throwing debris and officers responding with tear gas and rubber bullets. In Cincinnati, Downtown businesses have been vandalized and looted. An officer was struck in the helmet by a bullet. And protesters have been arrested. Sunday night, dozens of those arrested protesters were transported on Metro buses, chanting “no justice, no peace” as they were hauled away. So Cincinnati Metro shuts down to the public at 9pm only to be arrest protesters? Who thought that was a great idea? We got folks walking home from work right now. We gave our transit system to the cops. — Cam 🚍🚍 (@camhardy513) June 1, 2020 Miller said the request to use the buses came from Mayor John Cranley, and initially, Metro didn’t want to do it. But then, Miller said, Cranley called Metro board chair Kreg Keesee, who made the decision to use the buses. It was determined that Metro supervisors would drive the buses, rather than the regular operators, and that police officers would have to be on board at all times, too. Keesee confirmed it was ultimately his call to use the buses. He said Metro had concerns about the safety of operators and the bus itself – several buses have already been vandalized during the protests – but Metro agreed to help as long as police would be on the bus at all times. “Obviously this is a tense situation for everyone,” Keesee said. “We’re not trying to choose sides in any kind of discussion but had been asked by the administration and told they didn’t have any other options.” Cranley, through a spokeswoman, said he requested use of the buses “because we needed the help.” “From the first moment, we offered police protection for the drivers,"" he said. ""By the time we made the request, the drivers had been off shift for over an hour.” Police transport arrested protesters by bus. (Photo: Albert Cesare/The Enquirer) Bus drivers in Minneapolis and New York City have refused to help police in the protests following Floyd’s death, according to news reports. Miller said Metro buses have been used in the past to transport police during Cincinnati Reds or Bengals games, for example. But ""we’ve never used them as an arrest vehicle. Never,” he said. “To haul people as prisoners, our bus is not designed for that. And that sends the wrong message to the public.” Miller sent a text to his roughly 800 union members last night telling them what happened. The union also planned to put out a statement Monday morning saying it disagrees with the decision to use the buses. “We’re trying to put that message out,” Miller said. “We don’t want our people attacked.” The citywide curfew is in effect again at 9 p.m. tonight. It is unclear whether Metro buses will be requested again.

Wait, I get it. The nationwide calls for justice, as Floyd's death was ruled, a homicide by both the Hennepin County Medical examiner and in an independent autopsy authorized by the family. The autopsy shows that Mr Floyd had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death. Cause of death, in my opinion, is that's fix CIA due to compression of the neck. But the Hennepin County medical examiner released its summary, saying Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest without explaining what caused his heart to stop overnight curfews enforced in cities in at least 20 states in Washington, D. C. And many stayed out late into the night instead of going home. Protests were largely peaceful across the nation and that some marches policed even joining the people in solidarity like in Atlanta, where some officers were seen taking a knee before renewed violence. But unrest and clashes between authorities and demonstrators were on display in many cities. Police firing tear gas into this crowd of protesters in Philadelphia, sending them scrambling off the highway. In Washington, a chaotic scene as police cleared this peaceful protest outside the White House has thousands of demonstrators marched together in New York City. Others looted some of midtown Manhattan's most iconic stores. Similar scenes playing out in Los Angeles with businesses broken into. Earlier in Minneapolis, Terrence Floyd for the first time visiting the very location, his brother took his last breaths, overwhelmed with emotion before saying this to Demonstrators. If I'm not over here wiling out, I'm not over here, woman up stuff. If I'm not only messing up my community, no, what you are doing, What are you doing? Not doing nothing, because that's not gonna bring my brother back at all.

Protests have been largely peaceful.Many cities across the U.S. have enacted curfews, such as in Los Angeles where the curfew is the harshest since the riots in 1992, and New York City has announced its strictest curfew since 1943. Six Atlanta police officers have been charged after a dramatic video showed authorities pulling two young people from a car during protests over the death of George Floyd.The state of Minnesota filed a human rights complaint Tuesday against the Minneapolis Police Department in Floyd's death.Joe Biden mounted one of his most aggressive attacks against President Donald Trump on Tuesday, deriding the commander in chief's disregard of core constitutional values and blistering him for being “more interested in power, than in principle.” NEW YORK —Thousands of demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd remained on New York City streets on Tuesday after an 8 p.m. curfew put in place by officials struggling to stanch destruction and growing complaints that the nation’s biggest city was reeling out of control night after night.Mayor Bill de Blasio had doubled down on a citywide curfew, moving it up from 11 p.m. a night earlier, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard.Protests had resumed Tuesday during the day over the death of Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.People marched in groups of thousands in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, as merchants boarded up their businesses. As the the curfew time arrived, many were still in the streets and continued marching, with officers initially standing by and allowing them.But officers started ordering people to move along, and began taking people into custody. Demonstrators who had been on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan were herded off, with parts of the roadway blocked off behind them.“Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening. “We’re here because something needs to change.MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is taking over the prosecution in George Floyd's death, said Monday night that he will ""hold everyone accountable.""""I can assure you we are taking a fresh look,"" Ellison told CNN. ""We plan to hold everyone accountable who is legally culpable,"" he said, explaining that while he has spent the last 24 hours reviewing evidence, he cannot ethically comment as a prosecutor.""We are looking very carefully at holding everybody accountable who failed to do their duty and fell below the legal requirements of their position, or did something affirmatively that would be in violation of the law,"" Ellison said.""When we are ready, and that won't be long from now, we plan on taking the proper and deliberate action,"" he said.He said earlier in the day that he'd move as ""quickly and effectively"" as possible.""I need to protect this prosecution,"" he told CNN. ""I am not going to create a situation where people can say this was a rush to judgment.""On Sunday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced that Ellison, the former congressman who ran for chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, will take the lead in the case of Floyd's killing.WASHINGTON D.C. — The U.S. Park Police is denying it used tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters outside the White House on Monday night, saying officers instead used smoke canisters and pepper balls to aggressively push back the demonstrators.Protesters scrambled as smoke filled the streets and AP journalists witnessed people reacting to their eyes and throats becoming irritated. Journalists covering the protest reported the crowd was largely peaceful at the time; the Park Police said they were responding to protesters throwing items, including bricks and frozen water bottles at law enforcement.Justice Department officials offered a different explanation, saying officers were carrying out Attorney General William Barr’s order to expand the security perimeter outside the White House.Officers repelled the crowd nearly 30 minutes ahead of a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington. Shortly after the crowd was pushed back, President Donald Trump walked through the park where they had gathered for a photo opportunity at a nearby church.--------------Hundreds of people were gathered peacefully tonight at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. — a mix of black and white, young and old, looked out toward the Washington Monument.Several dozen uniformed guardsmen and women, along with Park Police, were standing on the steps of the monument.There were speakers and prayers and signs, calling for justice and an end to police brutality.“Together we are more,” a speaker said.On a breezy spring evening in Washington, this scene illustrates the peaceful demonstration that is starkly at odds with violent rioting and looting.“Make it quick,” one man said, “curfew is coming up in 30 minutes.”The peaceful demonstration concluded when the 7 p.m. curfew in D.C. went into effect.ATLANTA — Six Atlanta police officers are being charged with using excessive force during an arrest of two college students at a protest on Saturday night, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced Tuesday.The officers were filmed in downtown Atlanta breaking windows of a vehicle, yanking a woman out of the car and tasing a man. The two victims were later identified as college students at Spellman and Morehouse, both historically black schools, and were returning from protests calling for an end to police violence against black citizens.Arrest warrants have been issued for Lonnie Hood, Willie Sauls, Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Armond Jones and Roland Claud. Some of the charges against the officers include aggravated assault of Messiah Young, aggravated assault of Taniyah Pilgrim, simple battery and criminal damage to property, Howard said.Two of the six officers, Streeter and Gardner, were terminated Sunday by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The West Virginia National Guard is pursuing disciplinary action against a guardsman who posted on social media that he would shoot at people protesting the death of George Floyd, officials said Tuesday.The guardsman, Noah Garcelon, has already resigned his position as an officer with the Winfield Police Department after making the comments. In a series of now-deleted posts, Garcelon wrote that he would “start firing live rounds” at protesters and “see how many I can run over before my car breaks down.”Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state’s National Guard, said officials will be taking the appropriate disciplinary action related to Garcelon and any others “who make inflammatory comments related to protests going on across the nation.”Winfield Police Department Chief Ron Arthur said Garcelon acknowledged that he made the comments and stressed that he wasn’t a racist before resigning.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, has urged people to remain peaceful but said he would not hesitate to call in the National Guard if demonstrations in the state became violent.PHILADELPHIA — Joe Biden in a speech on Tuesday condemned President Donald Trump over the use of tear gas against peaceful protesters outside the White House in order to clear a park so that the president could visit a church for a photo opportunity.""The president held up the Bible at St. John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it every once in a while instead of just brandishing it,"" the former vice president and presumptive Democratic 2020 nominee said in Philadelphia.Characterizing the moment as a ""battle for the soul of our nation"" — an echo of Biden's central campaign theme — Biden condemned Trump's actions Monday night, which played out on live television as protesters who had been chanting with their hands in the air were suddenly scattered throughout Washington's streets.""When peaceful protestors are dispersed by the order of the president from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op, a photo op, at one of the most historic churches in the country or at least Washington, DC, we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,"" Biden said.LAS VEGAS — An officer has been shot in Las Vegas and authorities are responding to another shooting as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said.The officer was shot in the area of the Las Vegas Strip and an officer was involved in a shooting in the downtown area, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.The department said both shootings were on Las Vegas Boulevard.Protesters have been rallying for days across the country over the death of Floyd, who was seen on video pleading that he couldn’t breathe with a white police officer pressing his knee into his neck for several minutes before Floyd stopped moving.Police in Las Vegas said Monday that 338 people were arrested during three nights of protests. Police said suspects were jailed despite a local court policy calling for most people accused of misdemeanors to receive court summons to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ST. LOUIS —Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area.The police department tweeted early Tuesday that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. It was unclear who had fired the shots.The chaos in St. Louis followed continued protests Monday in Missouri over the death of George Floyd and police treatment of African Americans, with gatherings also held in Kansas City and Jefferson City.On Monday afternoon, several hundred people rallied peacefully outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protestors later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64.But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire. CICERO, Ill. — Authorities in a Chicago suburb where two people were fatally shot in unrest following George Floyd’s death are issuing fresh safety precautions Tuesday.Cicero officials cautioned residents to “stay home and stay off the streets” a day after violence and destruction erupted in the town of about 84,000 west of Chicago. Police say most of Monday’s chaos stemmed from residents trying to defend businesses. Roughly 60 people were arrested, mostly for burglary and weapons violations.Two men in their 20s were fatally shot around 6 p.m. in separate incidents related to the violent clashes.

I want you to look and the place where so many people are coming to grief. This is the intersection where George Floyd had that horrific encounter with police today. We're expecting his brother, Terrence Floyd, to come out for a prayer to lay some flowers. Theo idea is to focus on George Floyd and not on the violence. It is going to be a day of grieving and an emotional day for this community. It was another night of protest and unrest in cities across the country, with incidents of violence from New York City to Los Angeles. For the boss has been knocked down. The ones who cast that up no more because they don't have a voice anymore, all sparked by the killing of 46 year old George Floyd, who died in police custody pleading for his life as an officer. At least 40 cities have enacted nighttime curfews, and more than a dozen states have deployed the National Guard. But not all demonstrations have been violent. In Minneapolis, demonstrators gathering at the intersection with Floyd encountered police to remember the Minneapolis police chief also took a knee at the site and acknowledged Police needs to do better for community members. Need to know that the men and women that put this badge on that they're doing so in service to them and they should not, and they should not have to doubt. They should not have to doubt thean integrity and if they're gonna be treated in a compassionate and professional weight. And the police chief also saying that all four of those officers bear the same responsibility. It is, of course, a welcome message. But the protesters continue to say and continue to call for all four officers to be criminally charged. Reporting in Minneapolis, I'm Camila Bernau Back to you. Advertisement Officials see extremist groups stoking violence and disinformation during protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy U.S. officials sought to determine Sunday whether extremist groups had infiltrated police brutality protests across the country and deliberately tipped largely peaceful demonstrations toward violence — and if foreign adversaries were behind a burgeoning disinformation campaign on social media.As demonstrations spread from Minneapolis to the White House, New York City and overseas, federal law enforcement officials insisted far-left groups were stoking violence. Meanwhile, experts who track extremist groups also reported seeing evidence of the far-right at work.Investigators were also tracking online interference and looking into whether foreign agents were behind the effort. Officials have seen a surge of social media accounts with fewer than 200 followers created in the last month, a textbook sign of a disinformation effort.The accounts have posted graphic images of the protests, material on police brutality and material on the coronavirus pandemic that appeared designed to inflame tensions across the political divide, according to three administration officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss investigations.The investigations are an attempt to identify the network of forces behind some of the most widespread outbreak of civil unrest in the U.S. in decades. Protests erupted in dozens of cities in recent days, triggered by the death of George Floyd, who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. Pandemic-weary Americans were already angry — about COVID-19 deaths, lockdown orders and tens of millions of people out of work. The pandemic has hit African Americans harder than whites in the U.S., and the killings of black people by police have continued over the years even as the topic faded from the national stage. But there are signs of people with other disparate motives, including anarchist graffiti, arrests of some out-of-state protesters, and images circulating in extremist groups that suggest the involvement of outside groups.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that state authorities were hit with a cyber attack as law enforcement prepared to diffuse protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the epicenter of the unrest. He described it as a ""very sophisticated denial of service attack on all computers."" President Donald Trump, Attorney General William Bar and others have said the left-wing extremist group antifa is to blame. Short for anti-fascists, antifa is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.Barr on Sunday said the FBI would use its regional joint terrorism task forces to ""identify criminal organizers,"" and Trump threatened again to name antifa a terrorist group.The Justice Department is also deploying members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration on Sunday to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, a senior department official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.The addition of the federal agents, who will have armored vehicles, came as Barr warned that prosecutors could seek to use terrorism statutes against ""violent radical agitators"" who attempt to hijack protests to cause destruction. An antifa activist group disseminated a message in a Telegram channel on Saturday that encouraged people to consider Minnesota National Guard troops ""easy targets,"" two Defense Department officials said. The message encouraged activists to steal ""kit,"" meaning the weapons and body armor used by the soldiers. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.As a result, soldiers with the Minnesota National Guard were armed during their mission at protests across the state Sunday, the officials said. The soldiers are sometimes armed but had not been since they moved into parts of the state that had been besieged by riots in the last few days. The troops do not have the authority to make arrests, and are there to act mostly as extra security for police.Others have seen evidence of right-wing extremists. J.J. MacNab, a fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, has been monitoring chatter about the protests among anti-government extremists on social media platforms. She has access to dozens of private Facebook groups for followers of the loosely organized ""Boogaloo"" movement, which uses an '80s movie sequel as a code word for a second civil war.She also has been poring over images from the weekend protests and spotted some ""boogaloo bois"" in the crowds, carrying high-powered rifles and wearing tactical gear.""They want to co-opt them in order to start their war. They see themselves as being on the side of protesters and that the protesters themselves are useful in causing anarchy,"" MacNab said.She also sees signs that the Three Percenters militia movement appears to be taking an interest.Megan Squire, an Elon University computer science professor who tracks online extremism, saw images of at least four members of the far-right Proud Boys group on the periphery of a protest Saturday night in Raleigh, North Carolina.Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time and spoke on condition of anonymity.The Trump administration has largely remained silent on local reports that far-right protesters were also involved. Meanwhile, Democratic mayors said Trump's handling of the crisis was reminiscent of one of the darkest moments of his presidency — when he said there were ""good people on both sides"" of protests in 2017 over white supremacists demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia.America's racial fault lines are a perfect opportunity for foreign adversaries looking to sow discord and portray the U.S. in a negative light, according to James Ludes, director of the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island.""This is a real issue and Americans are legitimately upset about it,"" said Ludes, who studies foreign disinformation tactics. ""That's one of the hallmarks of these campaigns. You don't create new issues, you exploit existing issues.""There's a history of this. In 2016, another black man, Philando Castile, was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb, his death livestreamed on Facebook.Russians used a fake Black Lives Matter page to confuse and stoke anger among the protesters. There were nearly 700,000 followers, but it's not clear how many were real. One debunked example from this week: That Atlanta had deployed a ""child militia."" Floyd was accused of trying to pass a bad bill at a grocery store after he was laid off in the pandemic. Disturbing video showed him prone on the street, while a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck even as he cried he couldn't breathe. He later died. The officers have been fired; Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd in the video, was charged with murder. At first there were peaceful demonstrations, but violence soon erupted. A Minneapolis police station was torched and protests took off around the country, growing increasingly tense. Video showed a police vehicle ramming into demonstrators in New York. Meanwhile, a van with four New York Police Department officers inside was hit with a Molotov cocktail and torched. Hundreds have been arrested nationwide and cities braced for more protests. But booking information from the county jail in Minneapolis, for example, showed that out of 59 protest-related arrests, 47 people had a home address in Minnesota, with the majority coming from the Twin Cities.Before protests began in New York City, organizers of anarchist groups began raising money for bail, recruited medical teams to deploy for violent interactions with police and planned how to target high-end stores, said John Miller, the NYPD's deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Scouts on bicycles would also move ahead of the groups to report where the police would be and then direct small breakaway groups to areas where they could torch police cars or throw Molotov cocktails, Miller said. The NYPD has arrested 786 people related to protests since May 28 and 1 in 7 of them were not from New York City, he said. In Washington, where protesters raged outside the White House, most of the 17 people arrested were from the area. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the groups seemed, at the least, organized to destroy with tools to break windows and distribute materials.",0.0

Cincinnati Enquirer Protesters arrested overnight in Cincinnati took to social media early Monday to complain that they'd been held outside without food, water or access to bathrooms. ""This is scary,"" a young woman said in an Instagram post that appeared to have been recorded from the holding area. ""There are people that are being held outside at the jail. We're being denied basic human rights. Hamilton County sheriff's spokesman David Daugherty disputed the description of conditions at the jail and said everyone who has been detained has been treated well. He said about 100 of the 171 people arrested Sunday night were being held in a sally port at the Justice Center, which is enclosed on all sides but open on top. From there, he said, inmates are being brought into the Justice Center to be booked. [Subscribe now for unlimited access to Cincinnati.com] Although one social media post claimed someone had died while being held at the jail, Daugherty said that's not true. He said one of the protesters was taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure but was not seriously ill. He said everyone being held outside had access to restrooms. A view of the sally port at the Hamilton County Justice Center, where about 100 of those arrested Sunday during protests are bring held, according to county officials (Photo: The Enquirer/ Chris Mayhew) ""We're taking care of them,"" Daugherty said. ""We take care of our inmates."" Those being held had a different view. Video from cell phones showed dozens of people in a crowded area, surrounded by high walls with barbed wire on top. Some can be heard shouting insults at police or asking for help. ""They haven't given us any water, any food, not even a f---ing blanket,"" one man said in a Facebook post. ""I've been in handcuffs the entire time. I can't feel my hands."" ""It's horrifying right now."" The young woman said in her post that some people had vomited and urinated in the holding area because they didn't have access to restrooms. ""It's really wild,"" she said. ""This is unjust."" Multiple protesters who spoke with the Enquirer said that their hands were bound with zip-ties for the entire night. Protesters said they were told to sit on the concrete ground, against a wall and were not given food or water until the next morning. During the night, protesters chanted, ""No food, no water, no shelter."" ""When we were arrested, they told us they didn't know what they were going to do. They might let us go. We didn't know if we were being arrested, or ticketed, or what was going to happen to us,"" said Darrel Glass, a protester who was arrested Sunday night. Police typically confiscate phones and other devices when they arrest someone, so it's unclear how some protesters were able to keep their phones. The videos could not be independently verified, but they do, however, show surroundings similar to the makeup of the Justice Center and, specifically, the sally port area. Most protesters were arrested Sunday night within hours after the city's 9 p.m. curfew took effect and would have been in custody since at least the early morning hours of Monday. Temperatures fell into the high 40s early Monday morning.

Don't pretend there's not a problem in America. Don't turn your back on racism. Don't accept innocent lives being taken from us. Don't make any more excuses. Don't think this doesn't affect you.

Let's all be part of the change.""Nike's message comes four days after George Floyd, 46, died in police custody in Minnesota with his last moments caught on video. While being arrested, Floyd was held down by a Minneapolis police officer's knee. The video shows Floyd pleading that he is in pain and can't breathe. Then, his eyes shut and the pleas stop. He was pronounced dead shortly after. The officer was arrested Friday and charged with murder.This isn't the first time Nike has used their slogan for more than just sports.""Nike has a long history of standing against bigotry, hatred and inequality in all forms,"" Nike said in a statement to CNN Saturday. ""We hope that by sharing this film we can serve as a catalyst to inspire action against a deep issue in our society and encourage people to help shape a better future.""To mark the ""Just Do It"" slogan's 30th anniversary in 2018, Nike released an ad with Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who kneeled in protest during the National Anthem for a preseason NFL game.

(Photo: Phil Didion) After three days of protests, Mayor John Cranley moved the city's curfew to 8 p.m. -- and hour earlier than it had been Sunday night. The point of moving the curfew up is so officers can warn residents to get off the street before nightfall. ""This curfew is not a voluntary curfew,"" Cranley said Monday afternoon at a press conference. ""It is the law. It is dangerous for you to violate the curfew."" Cranley said the decision whether to extend the curfew to Tuesday night will depend on what happens Monday night. The announcement follows a weekend full of protests over the death of George Floyd, an African American man who died last week in Minneapolis when an officer held his knee to Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. The demonstrations began Friday and gave way to vandalism and looting of some downtown stores on Friday night. The police arrested 307 people Sunday night after the 9 p.m curfew, said Police Chief Eliot Isaac. This caused a backlog in processing prisoners, he said. Some sat on buses and the jail's outdoor sallyport for up to five hours, Isaac said. ""We made far more arrests than we had made the prior night,"" Isaac said. ""That did lead to a number of individuals backed up in order to be processed."" Cranley apologized to the protesters but the apology came with a warning. ""We're not suggesting it was a pleasant experience,"" Cranley said. ""It was not. We're sorry about this, but it is the case we will continue to enforce the curfew. To avoid this very unpleasant experience, the best thing you can do is obey the curfew."" Newport, Covington, Cheviot, St. Bernard and Elmwood Place have also established curfews. A vast majority of those arrested live in Cincinnati were young and committed minor infractions, arrest records showed. Cranley on Sunday hadn't been briefed on the arrests but expressed concern outsiders might be playing a role. ""I don't know the answer as to where they are from, from their appearance, but a lot of them have backpacks and I don't know why if you lived in this city, you would need a backpack, if you were intending to go home or if you were traveling long distance, but that is speculation,"" Cranley said. On Monday he said he wasn't suggesting most of the protesters were from out of town. ""I said I didn’t know whether or not they were outsiders,"" Cranley said. ""I did state that the people I witnessed were white. A majority of the arrests both last night and Saturday were, in fact, white. So I did not know, and I don’t really want to answer that question because I didn’t say that."" Isaac said the officer's morale is high. And he said Cincinnati Police officers condemn the death of Floyd. Isaac said he'd be open to marching with the protesters. ""They don’t believe what took place in Minneapolis was right,"" Isaac said. ""They all condemn that as well. They know law enforcement is more professional than that.” Read or Share this story: https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/06/01/cincinnati-protests-george-floyd-mayor-john-cranley-press-conference/5308165002/",0.0

McAtee, the owner of YaYa's BBQ in western Louisville, was known as a ""community pillar,"" said his mother, Odessa Riley. ""He left a great legend behind. He was a good person. Everybody around him would say that,"" she said. ""My son didn't hurt nobody. He didn't do nothing to nobody.""

(Photo: Sam Upshaw Jr./Courier Journal) Who was David McAtee? McAtee, 53, operated a barbecue business at one of the West End's most popular corners, especially on the weekends. “I’ve been doing this for about 30 years, but I’ve been here for two,"" he told West of Ninth, a photo blog by Walt and Marshae Smith, in a February interview. ""This location is the one of the busiest locations in west Louisville. I always wanted to be in this spot, and when the opportunity came, I took it."" McAtee said he hoped to one day buy the lot at 26th and Broadway, and build a brick-and-mortar restaurant. ""I gotta start somewhere, and this is where I’m going to start,"" he said in February. ""It might take another year or two to get to where I’m going, but I’m going to get there."" Those who spoke with The Courier Journal said they knew the chef as someone who would cook at several community events across the area's nine neighborhoods. ""Mr. McAtee would help us with Californian Day for at least 15 years, if not longer,"" Greg Cotton, Jr., who lives in Middletown, said in an interview Monday. ""He was one of the ones who would donate all his time and all his food; everybody could just come up and take it and he wouldn't charge because it was for the neighborhood."" McAtee's mother and his nephew told The Courier Journal that he was known to feed police as well. The two said he would give law enforcement officers free meals. ""He fed them free,"" Riley said. ""He fed the police and didn't charge them nothing. ""My son was a good son. All he did on that barbecue corner is try to make a dollar for himself and his family,"" she added. ""And they come along and they killed my son."" Who was Breonna Taylor?

(Photo: Walt and Marshae Smith/westofninth.com) Metro Council President David James described McAtee as a personal friend who cared about the California neighborhood and all other parts of the West End. He said the local chef was knowledgeable about what was going on in the neighborhood and the city, and always would offer free food to those in need and others. ""He’s just a good, decent person,"" James said. ""He believes in this neighborhood. He loves his city, loves his neighborhood, loves to cook food, loves to keep people happy with his sense of humor. He’s just a great guy."" Councilwoman Jessica Green said she didn't know McAtee personally but called the chef a ""staple in the community"" who was always friendly to people. ""And so, to wake up and see that he was now dead, I honestly for the last week and a half, I’ve had a pit in the bottom of my stomach about all of this,"" she said. ""I’m just very distressed and uneasy right now."" Cotton said the death of a generous working man in the community is going to be another slap as the city is still reeling from the controversial police shooting of Breonna Taylor. ""Mr. McAtee's legacy is something that cannot be duplicated or replaced,"" he said. ""There are only a handful of people who care about the community the way that he did.""

The chef said he had ""been shot and robbed since"" moving back because he was ""living a crazy lifestyle, but I had to give it up."" Riley said her son was always a good cook growing up. She told reporters Monday that when a mother loses a child, ""a piece of you goes along with that child."" ""It's alright to lose a mother or father. You get hurt by that, too.

Riley, McAtee's mother, said Fischer expressed his condolences and said that ""anything that he can do for me, he's there for me and my family.""

Prior to next week's event, separate memorial services in Minnesota and North Carolina will be held. Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will pay the expenses of all three events after the former boxing champion's offer of assistance was accepted by the family. It was another day of protests accross the country. Moments after police in riot gear tried to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters at Lafayette Square across from the White House, President Donald Trump said the civil disturbances that have erupted across the nation since George Floyd's killing on Memorial Day would be quelled. Under heavy protection, Trump and several members of his administration, including Attorney General William Barr, walked across the park to St. John's Church and posed for photos before returning to the White House. Earlier in the day, Floyd's relatives demanded further punishment for those involved in his death after an independent autopsy requested by the family concluded he was killed by asphyxiation from sustained pressure. The Hennepin County medical examiner later ruled the death a homicide. A closer look at some recent developments: George Floyd's funeral will be held on June 9 in Houston, Texas. Attorney General William Barr has deployed federal riot teams to Washington, D.C., and Miami in an attempt to quell violent clashes between protesters and police. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family Sunday, saying that firing Chauvin and the other three officers involved in the Memorial Day confrontation was the right thing to do. What we're reading today: How did we get here? A timeline of events leading up to the nationwide outcry against Floyd's death. Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Floyd's funeral to be held June 9 in Houston Family attorney Benjamin Crump on Monday said funeral services for Floyd will be held June 9 in Houston. There will be a public viewing next Monday in Texas, Crump said. Crump added there will be two separate memorial services for Floyd. One will take place Thursday in Minneapolis at North Central University. The other will be in Clinton, North Carolina on Saturday. Both memorial services will run from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for Floyd's funeral and memorial services after the family accepted his offer of support. The former world champion has not met Floyd's family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. Protesters tear-gassed as Trump vows to end riots Calling himself ""your president of law and order,'' President Donald Trump vowed to put an end to the disturbances that have broken out in many parts of the country following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week ago. ""As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,'' Trump said in a brief late-afternoon statement at the Rose Garden. Before Trump and his aides walked across Lafayette Park, police pushed away a crowd of protesters -- many of them holding up their hands and saying, ""Don't shoot'' -- using shields, horses and tear gas to disperse them. Trump's address came as hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington, D.C. Family autopsy shows Floyd suffocated; death ruled homicide An autopsy conducted Sunday at the request of George Floyd's relatives showed he suffocated to death because of neck and back pressure that cut off blood flow to his brain and kept him from breathing, a statement by the family lawyers said. The family is demanding first-degree murder charges against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is shown on a video pressing his knee against Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, and the arrest of the other three officers at the scene. “What we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death,” Dr. Michael Baden, one of the forensic pathologists hired by the family, said in the statement. “Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true.” Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe. ""The independent examiners found that weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function,'' the statement says. ""From all the evidence, the doctors said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the scene.'' The Hennepin County medical examiner classified the death as a homicide and said Floyd had a ""cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).'' The report also noted ""fentanyl intoxication'' and ""recent methamphetamine use'' detected on Floyd. Two Atlanta police officers have been fired after being accused of excessive use of force during a George Floyd protest. President Donald Trump said he would designate antifa as a terror organization and blamed the group for violence at George Floyd protests. Floyd's brother calls for peaceful protests Wearing a mask that read ""We can't breathe'' on one half and ""Justice for George Floyd'' on the other, his brother Terrence Floyd on Monday exhorted demonstrators in Minneapolis to keep his memory alive but to protest in a peaceful manner. Terrence Floyd chastised those responsible for the violence and looting that have marred many of the protests over his brother's Memorial Day death while in the custody of Minneapolis police, saying those acts didn't accomplish anything positive. ""My family is a peaceful family. My family is God-fearing,'' Terrence Floyd told a crowd, pointing out rioters may be destroying their own communities. ""Let's do this another way.'' Floyd urged those in attendance at a makeshift memorial to learn about the candidates for public office and to get out and vote. ""Educate yourselves. Don't wait for somebody else to tell you who's who,'' Floyd said. ""Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. That's how we're going to help. It's a lot of us! ... Let's switch it up and do this peacefully.'' The crowd, which had earlier chanted, ""Lock them all four!'' in reference to the four police officers at the scene of George Floyd's killing, later changed to a different chant with a similar message: ""One down, three to go.'' Though all four officers have been fired, only Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder. Trump derides governors as 'weak': 'You have to arrest people' President Donald Trump slammed the nation’s governors Monday as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters following another night of violence. Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses. “Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.” More than 4,400 hundred arrests have been made across the nation in sometimes-violent protests since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Disturbing sight: Vehicles ramming protesters The sight of vehicles ramming into crowds of protesters in at least three major cities has added a disturbing element that further stoked tensions during demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In New York, two police vehicles drove into protesters behind a barricade. Demonstrators in Denver chased a black SUV after a woman drove through a crowd and accelerated as a man hopped on the hood. A semi-truck driver was arrested after video showed the truck driving into a crowd of peaceful demonstrators in Minneapolis on Interstate 35, which had been closed to traffic. It's unclear how many vehicles were aimed at demonstrators, but witnesses said that the incidents seemed intentional and that the drivers accelerated as they went through the crowds. -- Ryan W. Miller Louisville police chief fired after another killing Greg Fischer, mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, said Monday that Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad has been fired in the wake of the law-enforcement killing of the owner of a barbecue establishment. Fischer also said a nightly curfew from 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel. The man killed was David McAtee, owner of a barbecue business next to a food mart parking lot where the shooing took place, according to his nephew. Police and National Guard troops, who have been monitoring protests, were breaking up a ""large crowd"" in the food mart's parking lot around 12:15 a.m. local time Monday when someone shot at them, Conrad said. They returned fire, killing McAtee. No one else was injured. -- Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal Protests may lead to coronavirus outbreaks Protests can be ""breeding grounds'' for the coronavirus, said Harvard University epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, among the health experts concerned that the close proximity among demonstrators could lead to more cases of COVID-19. Focus on the disease has diminished lately as media focus has shifted to the widespread riots sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. However, the virus remains a major threat, and it's more likely to spread among people not wearing masks and standing close to each other, as has often been the case at protests. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" Mina said. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Ken Alltucker and Karen Weintraub Chicago mayor: Violence, looting 'spread like a wildfire' Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Monday vehemently denied claims that she protected the city's downtown area at the expense of neighborhoods devastated by looting and vandalism Sunday night. Chicago officials, stung by nights of violence, had shut down most streets and transit headed downtown Sunday. Several city aldermen called on Lightfoot to increase National Guard numbers to 3,000, from the current 375, and to send them into neighborhoods. Chicago Police Supt. David Brown has said his officers are better suited for community duty. Lightfoot said she ""did not stand by and let the South and West sides burn."" “The fact is that the violence that we saw and the looting that we saw spread like a wildfire,"" she said. Police chiefs must hold officers accountable, law enforcement group says George Floyd's death was ""unnecessary, avoidable and criminal,"" the Major Cities Chiefs Association said in a statement Monday. The group, whose members include police executives from the largest cities in the United States and Canada, says it can be honest about its law enforcement history dating back over two centuries ""that has included institutional racism"" including violence against African Americans seeking equal rights. The statement says every major city chief must take every action ""within their legal authority"" to hold officers accountable. ""We need to hear what America is telling us right now,"" the statement said. ""We need to take bold and courageous action to change the narrative of our history as it relates to the disparate impact and outcomes that policing has had – and continues to have – on African Americans, people of color and the disenfranchised."" Federal riot teams sent to Washington after damage near White House Riot teams are being sent to Washington, D.C, and Miami from the federal Bureau of Prisons. The FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help in D.C., a senior Justice Department official said Monday.The federal prison riot team arrived in Miami on Sunday. A weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city where 88 people have been arrested, while dozens of law enforcement officers were injured, including Secret Service agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7 p.m. curfew Monday. She said significant damage was done around the White House on Sunday. There was also a fire at the historic St. John's Church across from the White House. – Kevin Johnson In New York: Police cars burn, no curfew planned, mayor's daughter arrested Setting a curfew in New York City to help curb violent protests would be a pointless exercise doomed to failure, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Monday. Police cars burned and several officers were injured in clashes Sunday night, the fourth consecutive night of violence in the city. Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose daughter Chiara was among almost 1,000 people arrested since Thursday, said NYPD officers ""showed restraint"" amid the mayhem. De Blasio also downplayed the value of a curfew. Shea, speaking on the ""Today"" show, said a curfew would be ignored and extremely difficult to enforce. “The problem is, people need to listen to a curfew and that’s not going to happen,"" Shea said. ""And if people think it will, they don’t understand what’s going on."" More news about the George Floyd protests Journalists attacked by officers, protesters As protests across the nation turn violent, members of the news media have been caught in the crossfire – or targeted. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it is investigating reports of attacks and arrests in Louisville, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. In Iowa on Sunday, police arrested reporter Andrea Sahouri of the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, on charges of failure to disperse while she was covering a demonstration that turned violent. Sahouri said police sprayed her in the face with pepper spray after she identified herself as a member of the media. ""I'm press. I'm press. I'm press,"" she said she told police. Carlos Martínez de la Serna, program director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said targeted attacks on journalists covering the demonstrations ""show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them."" – Lorenzo Reyes 3 dead in confrontations with authorities in Kentucky, Iowa Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear authorized state police to conduct an independent investigation after Louisville Metro Police and National Guard personnel fatally shot a man early Monday. Police Chief Steve Conrad said someone in the group gathered after the 9 p.m. curfew fired at the law enforcement personnel, who returned fire. In Davenport, Iowa, two people were killed in multiple shootings after rioting broke out, the police chief said at a news conference Monday. Chief Paul Sikorski said police responded Sunday night to disturbances near a mall involving 100 vehicles and ""rioters."" Over the next several hours, police responded to dozens of confirmed shots-fired incidents, including one where officers were ambushed and one was shot, Sikorski said. One officer was shot, one officer returned fire and several rounds hit the officers' vehicle. ""They were not like they protests and demonstrations Saturday,"" Sikorski said. ""What we experienced tonight, last night was completely unacceptable and it does not honor the memory of Mr. Floyd."" – Philip Joens, Des Moines Register; Billy Kobin, Louisville Courier Journal 2 Atlanta officers fired, accused of excessive force against protesters Atlanta officials fired two police officers and placed three on desk duty pending review over the alleged use of excessive force against protesters in a clash Saturday night. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she saw a video, which she called ""disturbing,"" of five officers pulling two college students out of a car downtown. Bottoms and police Chief Erika Shields made the announcement at a press conference after reviewing body-camera footage. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,"" Bottoms said. ""But we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable."" – Jessica Flores Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

File. (Photo: Andrew West/news-press.com) The Hamilton County Sheriff's Office flew a ""Thin Blue Line"" flag at the Hamilton County Justice Center, after days of protests and unrest in Cincinnati. When Hamilton County Commissioner Denise Driehaus saw it, she called Sheriff Jim Neil and asked that it be taken down. ""I know I am not alone in my view that flying the flag was provocative and inappropriate, especially in the context this weekend’s events,"" Driehaus said in a statement Monday. The ""Thin Blue Line"" flag was displayed after an American flag was stolen during protests, according to the sheriff's department. The blue flag has since been removed and was replaced with an American flag on Monday. The Thin Blue Line flag was raised by deputies to honor the Cincinnati police officer who was shot, according to a tweet from the sheriff’s office. The company Thin Blue Line USA started making flags, T-shirts and other clothes in 2014, donating a portion of its sales to law enforcement. During the Charlottesville protests in 2017, the symbol appeared among white supremacists. Here is the full statement from Driehaus: I was made aware of the flag flying outside of the Justice Center yesterday afternoon, called the Sheriff to voice my concern, and asked that the flag be taken down. It was taken down shortly thereafter. I know I am not alone in my view that flying the flag was provocative and inappropriate, especially in the context this weekend’s events. I am also not alone in my gratitude for those in law enforcement working overtime and putting themselves in danger to keep our communities safe. We need to find a way forward together that ensures that all community voices are heard and long-term solutions are found. The death of George Floyd is tragic and unacceptable. Justice for the family and friends should be fair and swift. The officers need to be held accountable for their actions. We need to confront the systematic racism that leads to poor health outcomes, economic disparities, violence, and unjustified deaths of black citizens who live in our country.

1622529806,2020-06-01 14:04:19,"Where does Louisville go from here? This is what community leaders, members have to say",http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625786214/0/courierjournal/home~Where-does-Louisville-go-from-here-This-is-what-community-leaders-members-have-to-say/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Where do we go from here? After four nights of protests in response to the death of Breonna Taylor — during which stores were looted and seven people were shot — it's a question that's come to the top of many minds. More: After nights of protest, Louisville is hurting. Where does the city go from here? The Courier Journal spent Sunday speaking with more than a dozen community leaders and members about what they think needs to happen next for the city to move forward. Here's what they said. Neeli Bendapudi, president of the University of Louisville ""We have a long way left to go as a country, commonwealth, city and university. Zip codes cannot dictate education, health and well being, inter-generational wealth transfers — and they do, now. It is important that we use this moment to take an honest, uncomfortable look at the systemic drivers of inequity and address them. At the university, we need to do the same. ""Community leaders need to make sure that the fierce urgency of now is not quickly forgotten."" Rev. Frank Smith, Interdenominational Ministerial Coalition Louisville's protests are ""a consequence of people who have ignored the persistent cries from the black community. “This city rushes to complete the projects and developments that suit its wealthy and its affluent, especially those east of Ninth Street."" Meanwhile, infrastructure is halted and delayed in the West End. Windows are boarded up regularly, he said. Smith called for Louisville to create a government aid program that would be ""singularly focused, priority funding for the development of the black communities of Louisville.” “We have not progressed any further over 400 years because there are policies that continue to put the knee on the neck of the black community,” Smith said. Angela Parsons, principal of the J. Graham Brown School Vandals involved in this weekend's protests made it clear it didn't matter what they were destroying when they spray painted and smashed windows at the Brown School. Sunday, as Jefferson County Public School employees worked to erase the vulgarity and destruction from the property, the school’s leader reassured students, parents and alumni of the value of human life over physical objects. “Our school is not this building, our school is made up of a diverse body of beautiful souls,” Parsons wrote in a Facebook post Sunday morning. “Some of our school family is suffering as are members of our greater community. The suffering of people angers me, not this vandalism.” The Brown School, which teaches kindergarten through 12th grade, is home to 743 students, 30% of whom are African American. “It is my great honor to care for these children for 13 years,” Parsons told the Courier Journal. “From the beginning of their time at this school until they graduate, we teach racial equity. And moving forward, we will continue to adhere to those values and the belief that every life matters and deserves to be heard, respected and valued.” More: Investigation launched into LMPD, National Guard fatal shooting of West End restaurant owner Jecorey Arthur, Metro Council District 4 candidate ""It will be impossible as a city or a state or a country to move forward in the future if we don't address and redress and resolve our past. ""It's going to take a holistic, systematic reset. Not only organizing in the streets, but also organizing in the classroom."" Change won't happen overnight, Arthur said, using the example of a hurt thumb. ""It took less than a second for my thumb to get damaged but days for it to heal. ... Imagine how long it will take after 400 years"" of injustice against black people, he said. ""The work we're doing now, I may have to pass off to my 2-year-old. He might be marching in 50 years like we are this week."" Stephen George, president and general manager of Louisville Public Media George was on the hunt for plywood Saturday after windows at the historic Louisville Public Media building were shattered amid Friday's protest. While plywood was important in the short term, George said he’s more focused on the long-term ramifications of the weekend protests and how his media outlet can work to build a stronger community. “From my perspective as a business leader in the city and as a white person, I think it is very important to listen to what our black friends are saying right now, both on the streets during these protests and in our daily lives,” he said. One way Louisville Public Media has already been working to ensure all voices in Louisville are being heard by tracking the diversity of its sources and how they represent those sources. “It’s just one way that we hold ourselves accountable to our mission,” he said, “the mission of being representative of the voices throughout our entire community and to be equitable in how we report on our community."" Also: Mayor says most protesters arrested at demonstrations live in Louisville Sarah Burbank, MacKenna Williams and Jacob Grant, students at South Oldham High School “We talk about this like the rioting is not American,” said Burbank, 17. “But a police system that's not accountable to anything is not American either… The most un-American thing that we could possibly have is a police system where it was ever allowed that they could just go into someone's house, and then that person could end up dead in the middle of the night.” After attending Saturday's protest, the high school students swept glass from Fourth Street on Sunday. The protests were about peace and unity, they said. They came from a place of hurt and “generations of terrorism.” Williams said her brother, who is Guatemalan, is already scared to go out at night for fear of running into police officers. And Grant said he was always told “don’t go west of nine.” Instead, through his work with the Kentucky YMCA program, he volunteered in the West End. He wanted to understand the separation, he said, and to understand what ""100 years of redlining"" does to a city. “It's really hard to see that and look at like, this is where I live. ... I'm benefiting from (this) system,” he said. Bayley Amburgey, recent graduate of the University of Louisville Ahead of Friday's protest, Amburgey made a call for monetary donations on her Instagram. She gathered $1,000 in less than a few hours, which she spent on water and other supplies for the hundreds of protesters who eventually hit the city's streets. The 21-year-old was overwhelmed by the show of support that the donations provided. But she was also overwhelmed by what she saw as the protest turned chaotic. White men intentionally provoked the police, she said, and refused to stop after she and her friends begged them to. A woman fell to the ground after being hit with a tear gas canister. Amburgey attempted to help by bringing the woman a mix of water and baking soda. But her throat began to close up, and she struggled to breathe. She had to leave. Amburgey's advice now to other young people and everyone who's angry is to educate themselves before marching into the streets. ""Go to things that Black Lives Matter sponsors,"" she said. ""They are adhering to the nonviolent principles. They've been trained by the people before us. ... If we're going to keep protesting, we have to be strategized and be organized. We have to be deliberate and intentional with every action that we do. ""It makes no sense to put black bodies in front of the police with no plan."" Amburgey said she's participated in activist training through Black Lives Matter Louisville, and she encourages others to do the same. Because even after the protests are over, the work won't be done. ""This is also a system that we're trying to take down,"" she said. ""We have to remember, this is a greater scheme."" David Jones Jr., former JCPS board member The turmoil of the late 1960s and the efforts of the Kerner Commission to investigate the causes of the 1967 race riots came to mind for businessman David Jones Jr. “I hear the unheeded warnings of the Kerner Commission that ‘our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white — separate and unequal.’ I hear Langston Hughes’ searing italics telling us that a dream too long deferred will explode,” Jones said. “The only today wisdom I can quote comes from Killer Mike’s plea to Atlanta: ‘It is not time to burn down your own home (but) to plot, plan, strategize, organize and mobilize ... If we burn down Atlanta, what have we got?’ If we burn down Louisville, what have we got?” Louisville councilman: I am 'begging' for officers in Breonna Taylor shooting to resign Christy Brown, philanthropist Brown, who owns the Republic Building on Fifth Street downtown, said she went to the property Saturday morning to meet a crew that was boarding it up. Nearby, the crew built a box around a statue of Mother Catherine Spalding to keep it safe from any damage. “We are a resilient enough community to figure out how to translate what’s happened into methods of learning and transformation,"" Brown said. “We must make sure our whole city understands this pain. We can’t be a city where people don’t feel safe because they are black — or any other reason. It’s important that we all see it and say it out loud. We can’t skip this step and our police must understand deeply that they are an essential part of the solutions.” Reach reporter Bailey Loosemore at bloosemore@courier-journal.com, 502-582-4646 or on Twitter @bloosemore.

1622529803,2020-06-01 14:09:25,Breonna Taylor's mother asks for Louisville cops to be fired and an end to violence,http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625786614/0/courierjournal/home~Breonna-Taylors-mother-asks-for-Louisville-cops-to-be-fired-and-an-end-to-violence/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — As Breonna Taylor's mother called Monday for the firing of the Louisville officers who fatally shot her daughter, Metro Council members pushed for the conclusion of the monthslong investigation into the death. ""I don't think that I'm asking for too much, just justice for her,"" said Tamika Palmer, who stood in Frankfort alongside Gov. Andy Beshear at a press conference. ""Just that people know the truth. What happened, that she didn't deserve this, that people are fired for doing this to her."" Taylor was shot at eight times and died in her hallway after Louisville police used a no-knock search warrant to enter her apartment in the early morning hours of March 13. Taylor's boyfriend said he thought intruders were breaking in and fired a shot that struck an officer. Three officers returned fire, killing Taylor. They have been placed on administrative duty pending an internal investigation, which Metro Council members complain is taking too long. On Monday, several members pressured Mayor Greg Fischer to put the full weight of his office behind the inquiry — demanding he turn over all the results to state officials no later than Friday. ""The fact that Breonna Taylor tragically lost her life in our community on March the 13th, and here we are, June the 1st, and that case has not been completed yet — is unacceptable,"" said Louisville Metro Council President David James, flanked by other members of Metro Council leadership. Councilman: I am 'begging' for officers in Breonna Taylor shooting to resign Tamika Palmer, the mother of Breonna Taylor, speaks at the podium used by Gov. Andy Beshear for daily press briefings on June 1, 2020. Amid continued protests on the streets of Louisville, Palmer and her attorney, Lonita Baker, left, called for the officers involved in Taylor's death to be fired immediately. (Photo: Courtesy of Gov. Andy Beshear's Office) Attorney General Daniel Cameron's office says it has not received all of the investigative information it needs to determine whether criminal charges should be filed against the officers who shot Taylor, a 26-year-old ER technician. ""Without the entire case, the attorney general cannot begin,"" James said. ""It's very simple."" Pressure to speed up the internal investigation comes as protesters continue to take to the streets demanding justice for Taylor, an unarmed black woman. Fischer, in a separate news conference Monday, said his office was committed to a full and thorough investigation, conducted by multiple entities, including Cameron's office, the FBI and the U.S. attorney. ""We might have disagreements on any outcome, but we should all agree that we want the facts on this case,"" he said, adding that he, as mayor, does not have the power to relieve the officers, noting restrictions because of state law and the officers' collective-bargaining contract. Cameron's office said Monday evening that the internal investigation into Taylor's death could be completed soon. ""It is now our understanding that (LMPD's Public Integrity Unit) will be concluding their investigation in the short term,"" spokeswoman Elizabeth Kuhn said. ""We are continuing to determine what investigatory steps we believe need to take place. The FBI continues to conduct an independent investigation to determine if the officers’ actions violated federal law, and our office is determining if any state laws were violated."" Palmer's call for the immediate termination of the officers involved in her daughter's death come as Louisville braces for a potential fifth night of protests — demonstrations that have been both peaceful and have included violent clashes with the police. See also: Website bearing Taylor's name takes users to police donation page In her plea, Palmer said continued violence would distract from her family's desire to see those involved in her daughter's death held accountable. ""We can't get justice with violence,"" Palmer said. ""It doesn't make sense. It doesn't help."" Beshear said he hoped giving Palmer the microphone would ""help people feel that their voice, and their message is being heard, including right here at the highest levels in Frankfort."" ""And I believe that what you heard today was that, yes, she wants justice,"" Beshear said. ""… But she does not want violence as things move forward."" Louisville protesters have repeatedly called for the firing of Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly and officers Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove — the three officers Louisville Metro Police officials have said fired their weapons the night Taylor was killed. Asked by a reporter Monday whether he agreed the officers should be fired immediately, Beshear did not provide a direct answer. ""I think I was one of the first that called for an independent review of the whole situation by multiple law enforcement agencies including the commonwealth attorney, the attorney general, and the FBI and the U.S. attorney,"" Beshear said. ""And I think they all ought to look at it. ""… And at least in one officer's conduct and shooting through a window, I think that there are some major concerns there."" Voices of the protests: What Breonna Taylor demonstrators are telling our reporters Beshear said Monday he did not join a morning conference call for the nation's governors with President Donald Trump because he was meeting with the Taylor family. In the call, Trump criticized governors' handling of recent protests and urged state leaders to ""use the military"" to quell the unrest. ""Even knowing that there was a White House called right then, my job at that moment, and generally, is to listen,"" Beshear said. ""I believe one of the biggest issues,"" Beshear told reporters, ""is that the family feels like they haven't gotten all the information right, that they haven't been communicated with and things took too long."" Prosecutors have dismissed charges against Kenneth Walker, Taylor's boyfriend, who was at her apartment the night of the incident. Walker said he fired his gun at what he believed to be intruders, one of those shots allegedly wounding Mattingly, the sergeant. Lonita Baker, a local attorney representing Taylor's family, also spoke at the morning press conference. The family wants to see the officers fired and ultimately charged, she said. ""There's no reason that they are still on LMPD payroll, as we sit here today,"" Baker said, adding that other jurisdictions facing unrest, including Minnesota and Georgia, have seen officials take ""swift actions against police officers for misconduct,"" ""But here, all we keep hearing about is due process,"" Baker said. ""However, Breonna Taylor did not get her due process."" Shortly after Palmer spoke publicly, Louisville Metro Councilman Brandon Coan, D-8th District, wrote a post on Twitter calling for the officers to resign. ""If (Fischer) won't fire the officers who killed Breonna Taylor, then I am begging them: JUST RESIGN,"" Coan said. ""Do it for Breonna and Kenneth Walker and their families. Do it for our city. And do it for your own souls."" Coan was joined Monday by Metro Council members Jessica Green, D-1st, and Barbara Sexton Smith, D-4th, in calling for the officers' employment terminations. Green additionally called for them to be ""arrested, indicted and convicted."" ""I think it's a problem that they've remained a paid part of our police force,"" Coan said. ""I can't fire them, but I can ask them to resign. I think it's the right thing for them to do. And I think it could be a first step on the long road to justice.""

1622545603,2020-06-01 06:56:30,Beshear: KSP Will Investigate Shooting Death After Sunday Demonstrations In Louisville,https://wfpl.org/one-dead-following-sunday-night-protests-in-louisville/,en,False,,93009,wfpl.org,http://wfpl.org/#spider,"Gov. Andy Beshear has authorized the Kentucky State Police to independently investigate the killing of a man in the early hours of Monday morning in Louisville. Law enforcement officers were clearing the parking lot of a convenience store at 26th and Broadway when shots were fired around 12:15 Monday morning. Both LMPD and the National Guard returned fire, and one man was pronounced dead at the scene. “It’s been a very difficult four days in Louisville,” LMPD Chief Steve Conrad said in a statement. “What is clear from what we’ve seen – from peaceful protestors to those who have shot at and assaulted officers – is that many people in our community do not trust the police. That’s an issue that’s going to take us a long time to work through. Once again tonight we saw peaceful protest turn to destruction. We moved quickly to disperse crowds.” In an updated statement sent later Monday morning, Conrad said this crowd was one of the last ones left at that point in the evening. He added that LMPD was interviewing several people of interest and officers will be reviewing “many hours” of body cam video. The coroner has not yet identified the victim. LMPD is expected to provide updates later Monday. This story has been updated.",0.0

Andy Beshear has called on Louisville officials to release body camera footage as quickly as possible. David McAtee was killed early Monday after Louisville police and National Guard opened fire at a gas station at 26th and Broadway. There was no protest there Sunday night; most of the activity was 20 blocks away, downtown. But the National Guard and Louisville Metro Police were called into the West End to respond to a large gathering and enforce the 9 p.m. curfew, Beshear said. Beshear: I hope people have seen that I'm willing to admit when the wrong things happen. But people shouldn't have to just believe me. They should be able to see it for themselves. — 89.3 WFPL News (@WFPLNews) June 1, 2020 Beshear said he knows he is adding to the pressure to get the footage out to the public, and he intends to. “I’m not asking people to trust our account,” Beshear said. Beshear led his press conference by inviting Tamika Palmer, mother of Breonna Taylor, to speak. Taylor was killed March 13 by LMPD officers executing a “no-knock” warrant at her home. Her boyfriend said he believed the apartment was being broken into by the plain-clothes officers and he fired one shot that struck an officer in the leg. Police returned fire, killing Taylor, 26. The protests that began Thursday in Louisville were largely in her honor, with the crowd chanting, “Say her name: Breonna Taylor.” When the protesters grew larger and property destruction began, the state called in the National Guard and enforced a curfew. Beshear said he prays that was the right choice. Palmer rekindled her demand: that the officers who shot her daughter be fired and prosecuted. “I don’t think I’m asking too much,” Palmer said. “Just justice for her.” David McAtee Sold Barbeque, Remembered As Generous According to LMPD, their officers and National Guard responded just after midnight to the West End gas station. Chief Steve Conrad said the officers were shot at and they shot back, striking and killing McAtee. Carolyn Wilder said she is like family with McAtee. She said he was always giving away free food to anyone at his barbecue stand — even LMPD officers. “Why are they downtown with rubber bullets and here with real bullets?” she asked. Just before 11:30 a.m., when he was scheduled to speak at a live “day of reflection” ceremony, Mayor Greg Fischer arrived at Dino’s. Surrounded by police, he spoke with and hugged McAtee’s mother. Fischer didn’t speak to the assembled crowd. Sadiqa Reynolds of the Urban League came through after Fischer and passed out masks to the crowd. Mayor: ‘The country is in flames’ Fischer did appear, albeit late, at his virtual ceremony for reflection, where he gave a short briefing on Facebook to address the chaos that’s engulfed the city, from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent protests that have erupted to denounce police violence and systemic racism. He held a moment of silence, and then read from prepared remarks and said the nation is “grieving on many levels.” Fischer did not directly address the shooting, and he only briefly discussed the recent protests that have erupted across the city in response to the March police killing of Taylor. “On the streets of our city I saw a diverse group of people gathered to honor Breonna Taylor and condemn racial injustice,” he said. “People who recognize that this was never about Black versus white, but right versus wrong.” He also questioned how the city moves forward amid the current unrest. “What do we do now?” he asked. “The country is in flames, what city will be the first city to put out those flames?” He offered no specific plan, but said he prays “our city can be the city to find the strength to put out that flame.” A Crowd Mourns, Waits At 26th and Broadway, where McAtee owned and operated a barbecue stand, more than 100 people were congregated, and the crowd was growing. Organizers on the scene with a microphone and speaker spoke to the crowd, and urged nonviolence. Metro Council candidate Jecorey Arthur said 100 organizers would be joining him to call for Fischer’s resignation. Arthur was armed with a rifle. Some gave speeches, but people at Dino’s were mostly grieving and talking to each other about how angry they are. A man brought in water and passed out bottles to the crowd. At the center of many of their conversations: that they knew this was going to happen, and it did. At the center of their anger: that McAtee’s body was still on the scene, nearly 12 hours after he was killed. U.S. Senate Candidate and State Rep. Charles Booker said in a statement that he was devastated by the killing — a mile from his home — that he said was “absolutely avoidable.” “The decision to send an armed military force into the West End of Louisville is a clear escalation of an already tense situation,” Booker said. “I have not heard a reasonable explanation for why the National Guard was deployed to 26th and Broadway, or how their presence was intended to make our city any safer.” Booker, a Democrat, called on leadership to stop using the National Guard, immediately release body camera footage, appoint a citizen review panel with subpoena power to investigate this killing — and to start that review immediately. His opponent in the Senate primary, Amy McGrath, tweeted condolences and that she supports Beshear’s call to release video footage and order an independent investigation. Booker arrived at 26th and Broadway shortly before 12:30 p.m., as local officials appeared to be preparing to remove McAtee’s body from the scene. He asked the crowd to stay peaceful on the sidewalk and not run across the street as police prepare to remove body from the scene. “But if you guys run,” he said, “I’m running with you. I’m with you.” As the family was given a chance to see the body before it was removed from the scene, the crowd stood quietly, fists raised, and held a moment of silence, except for a woman singing “Amazing Grace.”",0.0

1622592205,2020-06-01 15:36:19,"Breonna Taylor shooting investigation could take 2 to 3 more months, attorney says",http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625793306/0/courierjournal/home~Breonna-Taylor-shooting-investigation-could-take-to-more-months-attorney-says/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — An attorney for Breonna Taylor's family said Monday he was told that the investigation into the Louisville Metro Police officers' conduct in her March 13 shooting could take two to three more months. That timeline could create a significant delay in the attorney general's ability to review the complete investigatory file and decide whether criminal charges should be filed against the officers who shot her. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said last month that the department's Public Integrity Unit investigators turned over its investigation to Attorney General Daniel Cameron's office, along with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney. But Louisville attorney Sam Aguiar told The Courier Journal on Monday that Cameron's office was told by PIU investigators they wouldn't be able to turn over all the records from the internal police investigation for another few months. Council President David James said, too, that the attorney general's office informed him last week of the same time frame for a completed PIU investigation. He's scheduled to have a 4 p.m. press conference on the subject. Also: Investigation launched into LMPD, National Guard fatal shooting of West End restaurant owner Cameron's office said in a Friday statement that his office doesn't have the full police investigation into Taylor's shooting, contrary to what's been stated publicly. His office declined to comment further or to respond to Courier Journal question about what had been provided to the office and what records were still being compiled or reviewed. ""Despite reports, my office does not have the full LMPD investigation, which we understand remains ongoing,"" Cameron wrote. ""Such an investigation, to be done correctly, takes time."" 'We are reviewing what has been provided and will await the completion of LMPD's report."" ""We're furious,"" Aguiar said. ""We're not being given any sort of inventory as to what's been done or any explanation as to why this stuff hasn't already been done. Things take time, but we're going on three months post-shooting right now. Now we're being told they're only halfway done? Come on."" Aguiar said the public was led to believe that the investigation was done. ""That's not the case at all,"" he said. Taylor was shot to death by Louisville officers as they attempted to execute a ""no-knock"" search warrant at her apartment. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, has said he fired a shot as officers entered, not realizing they were police, which struck Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly in the femoral artery. 'My son didn't hurt nobody': David McAtee, Louisville business owner, killed by authorities The officers returned fire, striking Taylor eight times and killing her in her hallway. The three officers who fired their weapons — Mattingly and officers Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove — have been placed on administrative reassignment pending an internal investigation. Calls have grown for the officers to resign or be fired, including Taylor's mother, who called for their termination in a press conference with Gov. Andy Beshear Monday morning. Several Louisville Metro Council members also said the officers should go, with one saying he is ""begging"" the officers to resign if Fischer won't fire them. Aguiar added Monday ""it would be nice"" if there was transparency about the status of the police investigation, including ""what we have to date and what's pending."" ""That's transparent,"" he said. ""They won't even say that."" Fischer said on May 20 that the findings of an internal investigation had been turned over to Cameron's office. Today the Public Integrity Unit (PIU) of the @LMPD provided the Breonna Taylor investigation file to the Office of Attorney General Daniel Cameron, and is in the process of providing the same materials to the FBI and the US Attorney. 1/2 — Mayor Greg Fischer (@louisvillemayor) May 20, 2020 He wrote in a Tweet that the LMPD Public Integrity Unit had provided the ""Breonna Taylor investigation file"" to the attorney general, and was in the process of sending the same documents to the FBI and U.S. Attorney's office. He's said the Public Integrity Unit is available to follow up on additional requests, as needed, and that the investigation remains ongoing. In a statement following Fischer's announcement, Cameron didn't say what his next steps would be. He will be responsible for any decisions about whether to bring charges against the officers in the shooting. ""Because the matter remains pending, no further comment,"" a Cameron spokeswoman said. Where does Louisville go from here?: This is what community leaders, members have to say In his Friday statement, he said his office is in the ""process of determining what investigatory steps we believe need to take place."" The FBI's independent investigation into the shooting, which they previously announced, is being conducted through the Kentucky Public Corruption and Civil Rights Task Force, he said, which is a partnership between the FBI and the attorney general's office. Fischer said Friday that the local U.S. Attorney had recused himself, meaning the DOJ Civil Rights Division would determine if officers' actions violated federal law at the investigation's conclusion. ""Our office will determine if any state laws were violated,"" he said. ""we will continue to work with our federal colleagues in our effort to find the truth."" Cameron, a Louisville native, also noted that Louisville is his home and his ""heart is heavy"" concerning the ""fear and unrest"" in the city. ""It weighs on me, as I know it does for many of my fellow Kentuckians who are grappling with the tragic events here and in other cities across the country,"" Cameron wrote.

Protestors set fires in the Metro Courthouse, broke windows, graffitied buildings and vandalized business along Lower Broadway. Nashville Mayor John Cooper declared a state of emergency and imposed an 8 p.m. curfew Sunday night. The curfew will be in effect until 6 a.m. Monday. Police used flash bangs and tear gas to disperse demonstrators Saturday night, clearing downtown streets by 11 p.m. According to Metro Police, those arrested range in age from 17 to 61 years old — most were 30 or younger. Nearly all live in Middle Tennessee, though some individuals came from as far away Chicago; Arlington, Texas; and Buffalo, N.Y. Metro police later announced they’d arrested another man, 25-year-old Wesley Somers of Madison, on suspicion of setting fire to the Metro Courthouse. Somers is being charged with felony arson, vandalism and disorderly conduct. Police say he was identified with help from the community. Photos and video of a shirtless white man reaching into the fire at the courthouse circulated widely on social media Sunday. People linked the picture to Somers by noting distinctive tattoos. Police tell The Tennessean that they’re uncertain what motivated a group of demonstrators to riot in the downtown. They suspect antifa or white supremacists could have infiltrated the initial rally held Saturday afternoon, in a bid to stoke unrest. The “I Will Breathe” rally drew about 1,000 people to War Memorial Plaza. After it wound down around 5 p.m. on Saturday, some protesters began a mile-long march through the downtown. Police say a total of 30 buildings and businesses were damaged in its wake and six patrol cars were damaged. No officers were injured. Tenn. Gov. Bill Lee said the National Guard had been mobilized and could assist local police in enforcing the curfew, if asked. Lee also said the state would investigate the incidents, saying there’s “reason to believe that many of those involved in unlawful acts are not Tennesseans.” “The right to peaceful protest is foundational to our country,” Lee said, “but the violence and vandalism that occurred in Nashville last night was unlawful and tears at the fabric of our community.” ‘Testament to disenchantment’ It wasn’t immediately clear how the destruction started. The afternoon began with a rally that had little unrest. Participants at one point chanted for peace and escorted an agitator away. Organizers objected to the turn of events. Keith Caldwell is president of the Nashville NAACP. “I don’t think it reflects on the tone of the rally today. But it does reflect on the unrest that is here, and about how policing is done in this city. So, it’s just as much a testament to people’s disenchantment as the nonviolent rally was today.” One protestor, Lamont Lockridge, had come to Nashville from Murfreesboro for the rally. He’s a senior at MTSU and president of its Black Student Union. Lockridge says the chaos and violence wasn’t planned, and from what he saw, those setting fire to city hall were white and not part of the original group of protestors. Still, he understands why this rally felt so different from those past. “I want to make sure people understand that it’s not just about a name. It’s not just about a George Floyd, or it’s not just about a Trayvon Martin or a Sandra Bland,” he said. “It’s about all of the times where there is police brutality and we don’t hear about it. … That’s where that aggression comes from.” Lockridge says isolation from the pandemic — and how it is disproportionately impacting communities of color — is also fueling the anger felt by protestors. Broken windows and fires Demonstrators toppled a statue on the Tennessee State Capitol grounds of Edward Carmack. The segregationist newspaper publisher and state lawmaker is often remembered today for writing editorials attacking the Memphis journalist Ida B. Wells, who tried to draw attention to lynchings. Ryman Auditorium, Bridgestone Arena and the Music City Center were vandalized, along with a number of businesses along Lower Broadway. Protesters also clashed with police in front of the Central Precinct. Six patrol cars were damaged, but no officers were injured. This morning, Cooper said he surveyed the damage.

1622629810,2020-06-01 12:20:59,"Bishops ‘sickened’ by Floyd’s death, urge racism be met ‘head-on’",https://therecordnewspaper.org/bishops-sickened-by-floyds-death-urge-racism-be-met-head-on/,en,False,,655001,Record - United States (Louisville),https://therecordnewspaper.org/,"By Julie Asher Catholic News Service WASHINGTON (CNS) — The U.S. Catholic bishops said May 29 they “are broken-hearted, sickened and outraged to watch another video of an African American man being killed before our very eyes.” “What’s more astounding is that this is happening within mere weeks of several other such occurrences. This is the latest wake-up call that needs to be answered by each of us in a spirit of determined conversion,” they said in a statement about the May 25 death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis. In recent weeks, Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed 25-year-old African American man in Georgia, was fatally shot ,and three white men were arrested and are facing murder charges in his death. In March, Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American woman, died at the hands of white police officers when they entered her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky. “Racism is not a thing of the past or simply a throwaway political issue to be bandied about when convenient,” the bishops said. “It is a real and present danger that must be met head-on.” “As members of the church, we must stand for the more difficult right and just actions instead of the easy wrongs of indifference,” they said. “We cannot turn a blind eye to these atrocities and yet still try to profess to respect every human life. We serve a God of love, mercy and justice.” “Indifference is not an option,” they emphasized and stated “unequivocally” that “racism is a life issue.” The statement was issued by the chairmen of seven committees of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops: Bishop Shelton J. Fabre of Houma-Thibodaux, Louisiana, Ad Hoc Committee Against Racism; Archbishop Nelson J. Perez of Philadelphia, Committee on Cultural Diversity in the Church; Archbishop Paul S. Coakley of Oklahoma City, Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development; Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, Committee on Pro-Life Activities; Bishop Joseph C. Bambera of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs; Auxiliary Bishop David G. O’Connell of Los Angeles, Subcommittee on the Catholic Campaign for Human Development; and Auxiliary Bishop Joseph N. Perry of Chicago, Subcommittee on African American Affairs. Floyd, 46, was arrested by police on suspicion of forgery. Once he was handcuffed, a white officer pinned him down on the street, putting his knee on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes. A now widely circulated video shows Floyd repeatedly saying, “I can’t breathe.” He appears to lose consciousness or die and was later declared dead at the hospital. The next day, hundreds of people protested at the intersection where police officers subdued Floyd, demanding justice for him and the arrest of the four officers involved. The officers were fired May 26 and as of midday May 29, local prosecutors filed criminal charges against at least one of the now former officers: The one seen putting his knee on Floyd’s neck, identified as Derek Chauvin, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The federal Justice Department promised a “robust” investigation into the circumstances surrounding Floyd’s death. Protests in Minneapolis have turned to violent demonstrations and lasted several days, prompting Gov. Tim Walz to bring in the National Guard May 29. The protests sparked similar rioting in at least a dozen U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Phoenix, Denver, New York, Louisville, and Columbus, Ohio. The bishops in their statement pointed to their “Open Wide Our Hearts” pastoral against racism approved by the body of bishops in 2018. In it, they said: “For people of color some interactions with police can be fraught with fear and even danger. People of good conscience must never turn a blind eye when citizens are being deprived of their human dignity and even their lives.” In their May 29 statement, the committee chairmen called for an end to the violence taking place in the wake of the tragedy in Minneapolis but also said they “stand in passionate support of communities that are understandably outraged.” They joined with Archbishop Bernard A. Hebda of St. Paul and Minneapolis in praying for the repose of the soul of Floyd “and all others who have lost their lives in a similar manner.” In anticipation of the feast of Pentecost, May 31, they called on all Catholics “to pray and work toward a new outpouring of the Holy Spirit” and pray to “to rid ourselves of the harm that bias and prejudice cause.” “We call upon Catholics to pray to the Holy Spirit for the spirit of truth to touch the hearts of all in the United States and to come down upon our criminal justice and law enforcement systems,” the bishops said urged every Catholic, regardless of ethnicity, to “beg God to heal our deeply broken view of each other, as well as our deeply broken society.” Here is the full text of their statement: We are broken-hearted, sickened and outraged to watch another video of an African American man being killed before our very eyes. What’s more astounding is that this is happening within mere weeks of several other such occurrences. This is the latest wake-up call that needs to be answered by each of us in a spirit of determined conversion. Racism is not a thing of the past or simply a throwaway political issue to be bandied about when convenient. It is a real and present danger that must be met head-on. As members of the Church, we must stand for the more difficult right and just actions instead of the easy wrongs of indifference. We cannot turn a blind eye to these atrocities and yet still try to profess to respect every human life. We serve a God of love, mercy, and justice. While it is expected that we will plead for peaceful nonviolent protests, and we certainly do, we also stand in passionate support of communities that are understandably outraged. Too many communities around this country feel their voices are not being heard, their complaints about racist treatment are unheeded, and we are not doing enough to point out that this deadly treatment is antithetical to the Gospel of Life. As we said eighteen months ago in our most recent pastoral letter against racism, “Open Wide Our Hearts,” for people of color some interactions with police can be fraught with fear and even danger. People of good conscience must never turn a blind eye when citizens are being deprived of their human dignity and even their lives. Indifference is not an option. As bishops, we unequivocally state that racism is a life issue.” We join Archbishop Bernard A. Hebda of St. Paul and Minneapolis in praying for the repose of the soul of Mr. George Floyd and all others who have lost their lives in a similar manner. We plead for an end to the violence in the wake of this tragedy and for the victims of the rioting. We pray for comfort for grieving families and friends. We pray for peace across the United States, particularly in Minnesota, while the legal process moves forward. We also anticipate a full investigation that results in rightful accountability and actual justice. We join our brother bishops to challenge everyone to come together, particularly with those who are from different cultural backgrounds. In this encounter, let us all seek greater understanding amongst God’s people. So many people who historically have been disenfranchised continue to experience sadness and pain, yet they endeavor to persevere and remain people of great faith. We encourage our pastors to encounter and more authentically accompany them, listen to their stories, and learn from them, finding substantive ways to enact systemic change. Such encounters will start to bring about the needed transformation of our understanding of true life, charity, and justice in the United States. Hopefully, then there will be many voices speaking out and seeking healing against the evil of racism in our land. As we anticipate the Solemnity of Pentecost this weekend, we call upon all Catholics to pray and work toward a new outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Let us pray for a supernatural desire to rid ourselves of the harm that bias and prejudice cause. We call upon Catholics to pray to the Holy Spirit for the spirit of truth to touch the hearts of all in the United States and to come down upon our criminal justice and law enforcement systems. Finally, let each and every Catholic, regardless of their ethnicity, beg God to heal our deeply broken view of each other, as well as our deeply broken society.",0.0
1622631518,2020-06-01 16:36:16,Gunshot victim from Thursday's Breonna Taylor protest wants answers from LMPD,http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625797082/0/courierjournal/home~Gunshot-victim-from-Thursdays-Breonna-Taylor-protest-wants-answers-from-LMPD/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"William Clark didn’t know there was a protest happening in Louisville on Thursday night. The New Albany, Indiana, resident was enjoying a night out at his friend’s house in Louisville that evening. As he was leaving the house with a friend around 8:40 p.m., he saw protesters with signs, heard commotion and realized what was happening. The 36-year-old admitted he had not heard about the Breonna Taylor incident until that night, though he knew of George Floyd’s death. He gathered what happened to Taylor from the signs and speeches and decided to join in. Outside of Louisville Metro Hall, Clark said protesters started pushing a police car and he realized things were only going to escalate. “I was telling my friend, 'Let’s go,'” Clark said. “Right as I put that conclusion in my head, I heard the first gunshot go off.” Clark immediately got down on the ground, while still thinking he needed to escape from the scene. Then, more shots were fired. “As it went off again, I was running and I fell to my face. As I fell, I looked down at my leg and that’s when I saw the blood and I knew then that I was shot,” he said. “I didn’t know how bad. I just know I was losing a lot of blood.” Background: 7 people shot amid downtown Louisville protests for Breonna Taylor Clark was one of the seven people shot Thursday, the first of nights of protests that have been both peaceful and raucous. He limped to one of the cars at the scene, with a bullet pierced in his left ankle, and asked a stranger for help. “I said ‘I’m dying. Could you give me a ride to the hospital? I’ve been shot.’” The driver obliged and tried to leave the scene, although many protesters didn’t let the car through initially. Clark said the driver, Damon Candler, had to beg them that a gunshot victim was in his backseat. They eventually let them through. Clark was taken to University of Louisville Hospital, where he said police took his clothes to run some tests. He has not heard back from the police since, he said. His friend, Chas Reid, who was with Clark on Thursday night, lost him once the shots were fired. Reid frantically searched for Clark through tear gas but didn’t spot him. “For him to vanish in air or where I couldn’t find him, I was scared,” Reid said. “I didn’t know if he was alive or wounded or anything. I just immediately got worried.” Clark had surgery to remove the bullet and was discharged Friday around 2 p.m. He believes it was the police who shot him. LMPD said after Thursday’s protest that seven people were shot “by other members of the crowd” and that its officers did not fire their guns. On Friday morning, Lt. Colonel LaVita Chavous said that LMPD had “no leads on the shooters,” but the department’s Homicide Unit is continuing to investigate. The latest: Breonna Taylor investigation could take 2-3 more months, attorney says William Clark (front) was shot Thursday night in Louisville in front of city hall. He left the hospital Friday with Damon Candler, who drove him to the hospital. (Photo: Courtesy of William Clark) “I got shot directly in front of the police and I just find it hard to believe that seven to eight shots can go off right in front of the police,"" Clark said. ""It made me believe that the way the shot came, it came from their end. I honestly believe the police did it.” Sgt. Lamont Washington said Monday “we did not fire any shots” and that it is an open investigation. Clark has hired attorney Larry Wilder to help get some answers. “What we want to know is what did they take from him, what kind of bullet entered his foot and how did they rule out that he wasn’t shot by a Louisville Metro Police officer,” Wilder said. “It seems like they haven’t done an investigation and it seems like that is always scary when in this environment, the failure to investigate sometimes points to the desire to keep the real answer to the question hidden.” Wilder has requested that the hospital and Louisville Metro Police maintain all information and evidence related to the shooting, specifically body cameras. He is also determining whether any security cameras around the area might provide some view or any evidence of where the gunshot came from. Both Wilder and Clark also wondered why the names of the other gunshot victims have not been released. Clark said he would like to meet the people who went through his experience. “Other set of circumstances, their names would have been immediately released to the press,” Wilder said, “and the police would have been immediately asking questions about help from the community to catch the criminal that shot them.” While Wilder said he understands there’s a lot going on, transparency is even more critical these days. Councilman: I am 'begging' for officers in Breonna Taylor shooting to resign “If someone shot you, would you expect the police to do the investigation?” he said. “If the police came (and) took everything that was evidence of the shooting, would you expect they were doing an investigation? If you expect that they were doing an investigation, wouldn’t you think they would talk to you? “None of that happened and none of it’s happened.” Clark, a technician at Electro-Tech Services in Louisville, said it will be at least six weeks before his wound is healed. His family is grateful that the injury is nothing more serious than what it is. He’s also been in touch with Candler, his “life saver.” When Clark found out that he was going to “live through it” at the hospital Thursday, his first thought was Candler and his car. “I called him and told him I’d be willing to do anything to clean and help with the backseat,” Clark said. “He said, 'Don’t worry about it. You just owe me friendship.'” Given his condition, Clark will not be able to join future protests but said he will be there in spirit. “People are protesting about the wrongdoing of the law enforcement,” Clark said, “and Breonna Taylor and George Floyd are what we are bringing to light and LMPD showed no effort to deal with violence mainly because they are the problem.""

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — After a weekend of unrest, one man was killed early Monday morning during a incident between the Louisville Metro Police Department, Kentucky National Guard and a crowd at Dino's Food Mart in the Russell neighborhood. David McAtee was well-known in the community, running Yaya's BBQ in the corner where the incident occurred. ""David's been here a long time before me,"" said Tony Martin, head cook at Dorothy's Kitchen. ""David never bothers a soul. That's like a neighbor, that man did not deserve what happened to him."" Witnesses said he was an innocent bystander during the incident, telling WHAS11 he was trying to save his niece from being hit in the crossfire when shots rang out. ""That was his life right there,"" his nephew Marvin McAtee said. ""He lived slept and lived out there, you ain't gone catch him too far off base."" McAtee's family said he was hoping to expand his business, always trying to feed and help others in need. ""He was a gentleman,"" his cousin Daryl Teague said. ""He fed the police when they came over...he was a giving man. This is what he gets after all this?"" In an interview with Walt and Marshae Smith of West of Ninth, McAtee talked about leaving for Atlanta before returning to Louisville and opening up shop. ""I’m just thankful for being here,"" he said. ""When I wake up, I gotta give thanks. Sometimes, you have to bless somebody because you were blessed. I’m just thankful for the opportunity to bless others."" McAtee said his location was one of the busiest in West Louisville, saying he wanted to be the spot everyone went to. ""If I go, somebody else will snatch it,"" McAtee said. ""I’ve already built my clientele, and I’m not trying to give up my clientele. I’m here for a reason."" He also spoke about helping people in need, saying it was important to not be selfish in life. ""If you pass it down, a lot of people might be in a better place than before,"" McAtee said. Police said they fired after someone in the crowd shot at them. Gov. Andy Beshear has asked for body camera footage from the scene to be released. His body sat at 26th and Broadway for hours as officials continue investigating his death. This story will be updated. Make it easy to keep up-to-date with more stories like this.

Fischer also said Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad, who previously announced his resignation in May, had been dismissed, according to the Courier Journal. A nightly curfew from 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. will be extended through June 8, he added. Gov. Andy Beshear (D) has ordered the state police to investigate the fatal shooting of David McAtee in the early hours of Monday morning and the release of any applicable body camera and video footage “before nightfall.” ADVERTISEMENT Police and National Guard have claimed they were shot at while breaking up a “large crowd” in the Dino's Food Mart parking lot and that they killed McAtee when they returned fire, although it is unclear whether McAtee fired the shot. Officials have not yet formally identified McAtee as the shooting victim, nor have they specified whether multiple officers or guardsmen shot McAtee. Local activists have questioned whether the gathering being broken up was a protest or simply a gathering of customers for McAtee’s barbecue, according to the newspaper.

On Monday night in Cincinnati, the curfew came and went and the crowds remained – until they were detained. A SWAT vehicle drove behind a group of demonstrators who had ignored the curfew and marched through the city since 1 p.m. An officer shouted through a megaphone: ""You're in violation of curfew. You will be arrested."" At about 8:15 p.m., dozens of officers with riot shields marched down the street and began making arrests. Some protesters ran. Others put their hands up. They all seemed to end up on the ground. Protests in Cincinnati, Monday June 1, 2020. (Photo: Kareem Elgazzar / The Enquirer) ""Get back. Go home,"" a female officer shouted at anyone in front of her. ""Get back. Go home."" On Monday, the arrests happened in daylight. The curfew had been moved up an hour, and it seemed to help. There were no reports of tear gas or pepper balls used by police. Any confrontations appeared to be over quickly, as those arrested waited to be bussed to the county jail. It was tense, and then it was over. Around 9 p.m., Cincinnati police reported between 40 and 50 arrests had been made. More than 300 were made the previous night. Protests and civil unrest have unfolded each night across the country since a white police officer kneeled on George Floyd’s neck a week ago in Minneapolis, asphyxiating him. The officer was fired and charged with murder, but that has not been enough to quell the unrest across the nation. At 10 p.m. on Monday, the streets of downtown Cincinnati seemed largely empty. But one night without violence does not heal a city and a country on edge. And even this was not a night without incident.

Cincinnati City Councilman Chris Seelbach shared video of a television journalist being pushed out of the way on Twitter. ""This is NOT OK,"" Seelbach wrote. As curfew approached, demonstrators threw firecrackers on the ground. Some in the crowd jumped. People in their cars honked as they drove by. Police said they were having rocks thrown at them while they tried to clear the street. It had been relatively calm up until then. Earlier in the day, outside police headquarters, a man played saxophone in the street while a crowd of protesters chanted at officers lined up with riot shields. The city’s police chief rested his hand on the guard rail separating the two groups and took a knee. Then, Chief Eliot Isaac bumped fists with a few people. Others asked for hugs and tried to take photos. There was applause, and then there were shouts for everyone in the department to kneel. Some did, some didn’t.

Demonstrators took to the streets to protest the death of George Floyd, a black man who died on Monday, May 25, 2020, in Minneapolis after a white police officer kneeled on his neck, ignoring Floyd's pleas that he could not breathe. (Photo: Kareem Elgazzar/The Enquirer) The day started with protesters who had been arrested Sunday night complaining about the conditions of their incarceration. Some were kept outside throughout the night because the jail’s intake room was too small to fit them all. One woman posted a Facebook Live video saying falsely that someone had died. A spokesman for the sheriff's office said one person was taken to the hospital, but suffered only minor injures. Those arrested began to be released on Monday morning. The 1 p.m. planned protest went as planned, peaceful but with purpose. Around 7 p.m., protesters moved to Fountain Square. A man with a bullhorn urged demonstrators to observe curfew. “We can’t be going to jail,” he said. “We got to be smart.” Around the same time, President Donald Trump urged states to deploy the military to stop violent protests, calling them “acts of domestic terror.” Cincinnati Police Officers arrest protesters on McMicken Street in Over-the-Rhine after the 8 p.m. curfew on Monday, June 1, 2020.

Prior to that, there was Timothy Thomas, a black man who was shot and killed in 2001 by a white police officer in Over-the-Rhine. Thomas’ death sparked days of civil unrest and a declaration of martial law. “I’m sick and tired of it,” one protester told The Enquirer outside the courthouse Monday. “There’s not justice,” said another. “There’s no justice at all."" Around 1 p.m., hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Hamilton County Courthouse, spilling out into the road and blocking Main Street to traffic. Facing a line of sheriff’s deputies in riot gear who were guarding the entrance to the courthouse, the protesters waved signs and chanted. “Who do you protect?” “Who do you serve?” “Black lives matter!” “I can’t breathe!” Protesters walk on Main Street past an armored police vehicle outside the Hamilton County Courthouse in downtown Cincinnati on Monday, June 1, 2020. This is the fourth night of protests in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. (Photo: Meg Vogel/ The Enquirer) The crowd repeatedly shouted for deputies to take a knee with them to honor Floyd. Shortly before 2 p.m., Sheriff Jim Neil and a few deputies did just that. Around 2:45 p.m., protesters left the courthouse, with some marching to City Hall and others heading toward the Hamilton County Justice Center. Organizers reiterated their wish for a peaceful march, but City Hall was still evacuated. At each location, protesters were met by a line of officers in riot gear. Just before curfew on Monday, four people were arrested. Police said one man pointed a gun – painted red, white and blue – at a security guard. Officials searched his car and seized a 100-round magazine. ""It's not even dark yet,"" Chief Isaac told a TV reporter.

Marchers displayed 'Black Lives Matter' signs, although the event was not organized by that group. Other displays had the names of black people who have died in police custody. Throughout the marching, protestors remained peaceful, and there was no police presence during the event. Protestors in downtown Bowling Green were led in chants calling for racial equality and changes to policing. The speeches contained a theme of anger towards the police. “I know it’s a common theme at these protests to say not all cops are bad, but I disagree.

""In the beginning of the week, I was trying to find MMA fights, trying to find events. And now, a week later, I'm out here marching, and I love that. It's a good thing,"" Overstreet said. ""It feels like I'm on the right side of history."" Overstreet said increasing positive communication between communities, the working class, and law enforcement will help the country heal. Outside the Bowling Green police station, Overstreet drew comparisons between how someone that only sees violent representations of recent protests would have a negative view of demonstrators, and how someone who only has negative experiences with police would think poorly of law enforcement. ""It's not a thing of all cops being bad personally. But if the system they represent and the people they work for has been consistantly based throughout its history on oppression, then what they stand for is bad. What they represent is bad,"" Overstreet said. A common theme of Monday's protest was the morality behind non-black individuals coming together to support causes like Black Lives Matter. An individual who went by Guero, who Overstreet nicknamed ""Street Jesus,"" co-led the crowd of around 100 people while wearing a rosary and carrying a megaphone. ""I'm tired of our people being demonized. Our people, as in, the people who have more melanin than normal. Whether black or dark brown, or whatever, we're often demonized,"" Guero said, ""I'm tired of it. I felt the need to show up and be like, 'We can have change that's peaceful. We don't have to be demonized and be seen as a problem. We can be the solution."" The demonstrators first marched from the Warren County Justice Center to the Bowling Green Police Department, where on Friday, a motorist appeared to intentionally bump into a protester with his truck. The crowd then continued to Circus Square Park before finally coming to a stop on the corner of 13th St and College St. Protests have erupted globally in the wake of recent deaths of multiple unarmed black individuals at the hands of police, including a Louisville Emergency Medical Technician.",0.0
1622670073,2020-06-01 17:19:34,5 takeaways: What Beshear said about fatal shooting of David McAtee in Louisville,http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625800240/0/courierjournal/home~takeaways-What-Beshear-said-about-fatal-shooting-of-David-McAtee-in-Louisville/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"CLOSE People say they're ""angry"" and ""want justice"" after popular a barbecue restaurant owner, David McAtee, was shot and killed Monday by law enforcement. Louisville Courier Journal Gov. Andy Beshear spoke with frustration about the fatal shooting of a black man in the West End on Monday morning, calling it ""unacceptable"" that Louisville police officers involved did not have their body cameras turned on during the interaction. ""After everything that's happened, this can't happen,"" Beshear said Monday afternoon. ""It shouldn't have."" The man who was killed was David McAtee, the popular owner of a barbecue business next to the Dino's Food Mart parking lot, McAtee's nephew told The Courier Journal. The shooting occurred around 12:15 a.m. at the site, which is near 26th and Broadway. Here are five key takeaways from what Beshear said over the course of his two press conferences, which were held on the same day McAtee died. 'My son didn't hurt nobody': David McAtee, business owner, killed by authorities Beshear wants all body camera footage to be reviewed In his first press conference, Beshear called for Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and LMPD to publicly release video of Monday's shooting ""as soon as possible."" But Fischer said in a Monday afternoon press conference that the officers involved did not have their body cameras activated — which led to Fischer firing Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad, who planned to step down by the end of June. Fischer showed video footage from nearby pole cameras as well as police radio transmissions during his briefing. Beshear subsequently said he wants the Kentucky State Police to review the body cameras of all officers on the scene. ""It is unacceptable that the officers that responded last night did not have body cameras on and recording,"" Beshear said late Monday afternoon. ""This is the entire reason that we have those cameras, and every other officer's camera should be reviewed and if they captured any part of the scene, it ought to be released."" Related: Investigation launched into fatal shooting of West End restaurant owner State police team is investigating Beshear indicated he quickly pushed for the Kentucky State Police to investigate Monday's shooting and said a team from that agency is doing so. ""I've been in the office since 4:15 this morning reaching out to different groups involved and calling for the Kentucky State Police to be involved with either an independent investigation or direct oversight of this investigation,"" he said Monday morning. ""The group that is on the ground from the Kentucky State Police is the group that investigates shootings in other police units across the state,"" he continued. ""They are the independent group that does this and they are the only independent group that I have to directly call on to investigate."" Beshear promised a ""swift investigation"" Monday afternoon and said that the KSP team that's handling it will ""let people know the truth"" and ""truly seek justice."" Beshear says Fischer 'needs to look really hard' at Breonna Taylor case On top of expressing anger over the lack of body camera footage in the shooting of McAtee, Beshear also said it is ""unacceptable"" how long it is taking the Louisville Metro Police Department to investigate the officers who shot and killed Breonna Taylor in her own home. An attorney for Taylor's family said Monday he was told that the investigation into the LMPD officers' conduct in her March 13 shooting could take two to three more months. ""It's unacceptable that Breonna Taylor's family has been apparently told it would take months to finish the rest of the investigation,"" Beshear said. When asked about Fischer's handling of the matter, Beshear said the Louisville mayor ""needs to look really hard"" at the case. ""I have not seen that file, or that investigation but I think it requires a very close look,"" Beshear said. Attorney: Breonna Taylor shooting investigation could take 2 to 3 more months CLOSE David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue business in western Louisville, was known as a ""community pillar,"" said his mother, Odessa Riley. Louisville Courier Journal Officers were responding to curfew violation Beshear provided details Monday morning about the information he has received so far about the McAtee case, although he stressed that the facts are still being determined. Beshear said it appears the authorities were responding to a violation of the curfew public officials instituted in Louisville but that it doesn't appear the people at 26th and Broadway were part of the protests. ""At least what I'm told, I don't think it was even a demonstration. I think it was a gathering,"" he said. ""And again, we want to get to all the facts, but my understanding is that the conversations weren't even tense once people arrived. ""But that's when at least a shot, if not multiple shots, were fired on LMPD and the National Guard,"" he continued. ""At least what we believe happened is that the National Guard, the police and the crowd that was still with them, in part, were all fired upon."" After that happened, he said it's his understanding that shots were fired by LMPD and a couple of members of the National Guard. Those Guard members both were ""pulled off of that direct duty while we are determining what happened."" National Guard not recalled Beshear said the plan is to maintain a similar presence of the National Guard in Louisville to ""ensure that we keep order."" He also said new guidelines will be instituted for the Guard but declined to say whether those will include restricting or prohibiting them from deploying to the West End. He acknowledged he's responsible for sending the National Guard to the city to assist the police during the protests. ""And I don't want anybody hurt in all of this, and that's why we've got to look really carefully at what happened last night because someone was hurt,"" he said. ""There was obviously a shooting and we have a death, and we've got to know all the facts about it.""

In a statement, the executive director of the Louisville Metro Police Foundation said they had nothing to do with the website and had temporarily shut down their page until they could determine who did it. ""We would NEVER do something so inappropriate and are doing our best to track down who put our link on this page,"" said Tracie Texas Shifflett, the group's director.

Taylor, 26, was fatally shot while Louisville police officers were executing a no-knock search warrant at her southwest Louisville apartment as part of a narcotics investigation just before 1 a.m. on March 13. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he did not hear officers announce themselves and fired a single shot. Taylor was killed in the return fire. Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly was struck in the femoral artery by Walker's shot and has survived. No drugs were found at the apartment. Walker was charged with attempted murder after the shooting. Jefferson Commonwealth's Attorney Tom Wine announced last month that all charges against him were being dismissed. Also: Police officer left out key facts in obtaining indictment of Breonna Taylor's boyfriend The shooting has captured national attention along with other controversial shootings of African Americans across the country.

The group left Jefferson Square Park at around 8:15 p.m. They're headed toward the University of Louisville via Sixth Street, according to Courier Journal reporter Sarah Ladd, and plan to return to the park by midnight. • 7:45 p.m. — Protesters at Jefferson Square Park are preparing to march through downtown Louisville again Sunday night to recognize Breonna Taylor. Hundreds have been gathered peacefully throughout the afternoon at Sixth and Jefferson streets, after a prayer walk took place earlier in the day at Central Park. James Johnson, just 17 years old, is leading Sunday's march, according to The Courier Journal's Sarah Ladd. He led a march on Monday, he said, and the continued vigor of the crowd has inspired him to keep coming back. “Everybody keeps showing up, and me being a young black man and knowing that I have a future, that’s a lot of motivation right there,"" Johnson said. • 6:30 p.m. — Terry Willis had some company in his walk through Louisville. Willis is from Huntsville, Alabama, and has vowed to walk to Minneapolis, Minnesota, ""in silent protest of the current social injustices faced by Black people in America."" He made his way through Louisville on Sunday, turning off of 26th Street onto Jefferson Street at 5:30 p.m., as a driver behind him livestreamed the walk on Facebook. About a dozen people came off the streets to join him at times as he made his way through the city. Willis made it to the courthouse around 6 p.m. and thanked those who had continued to encourage him, after a moment of silence for Breonna Taylor. • 5 p.m. — The prayer service concluded at Central Park at 5 p.m. after two hours of addresses from local faith leaders and other performances by Louisville musicians. Organizers handed out voter registration cards to the 200 or so people in attendance and held a moment of silence at one point in honor of George Floyd for eight minutes and 46 seconds.

A number of pastors were among those in attendance, as well as a group of high school coaches from around the city. Meanwhile, a separate protest was taking place in Jeffersontown. Chandra Goforth Irvin, one of the speakers, encouraged the crowd to fight for a better future in a number of ways — vote, speak up against injustices and ""demonstrate privately and publicly that black lives matter.""

Saturday • 10 p.m. — As the sun set and darkness crept over the lawn of Metro Hall, the face of Breonna Taylor became ever clearer on the government building. For a second night in a row, the painting by Louisville artist Jaylin Stewart was projected onto the large building in memory of Taylor before of crowd of hundreds. The group took a knee for a moment of silence at dusk, then chanted Breonna’s name before heading out for another march on Louisville’s streets. Hundreds of people remained at Jefferson Square Park, singing and dancing to Michael Jackson's ""They Don't Care About Us."" In the crowd was Stewart, who said seeing so many people interact with her artwork on such a large scale was overwhelming and liberating. “It's just beautiful to see people out here still celebrating her life with my artwork,” she said. “My intention was to make sure that you see her face all over Louisville. I'm from Louisville. I was born and raised here. And I feel like what happened to her could have easily been me.” Stewart — who for years has created portraits of people killed by gun violence — gifted the actual painting to Taylor’s family on Friday. “I was just so blessed to be able to do that and make her family happy,” Stewart said. “I just wanted to make sure that the picture got to them and they knew that I’m fighting for her and this entire city is fighting for her.” • 9 p.m. — Protesters returned to downtown Louisville as the sun went down, chanting ""Black Lives Matter"" and holding signs that said ""White Silence Is Violence"" and ""Black Lives Matter More than White Feeling.""

After some music, speakers reminded the crowd that Kentucky's primary elections are on June 23. The crowd broke out in a ""We gonna vote"" chant. • 8 p.m. — Louisville native Jamayka Spriggs returned to Jefferson Square on Saturday and saw a much different scene than a week before. The crowd she saw gathered for the vigil and balloon release was beautiful, she said. “There’s so many different types of people out here,” she said. “All colors, of all different types of scenes coming together for one common goal, which is to bring justice, because we do have the power to do that.” A week earlier, Spriggs was downtown for one of the first days of protests. Instead of music, tear gas filled the air. The last two weeks have been an emotional roller coaster, she said. There’s been days when she’ll log into Facebook or check the news and can’t help but cry. Other times, she’s so angry she needs to shut her computer. “There’s a lot of people who still don’t get it,” she said. “They’re still focus on looting stores. That’s not even a part of the protests.” She showed up Saturday to speak out against injustice, she said. She wants police officers held accountable when they kill civilians and funding shifted from police departments to building up African American communities and investing in public health. “There are some African Americans out there who don’t think their voices have ever been felt or heard,” she said. “And right now, they’re feeling heard for once in their lives.” Meanwhle, after spending a few hours at Jefferson Square Park, a group of walked to Norton Hospital, one of two hospitals where Breonna Taylor worked as an ER technician. Chants included ""no justice, no peace"" and ""say her name."" • 7 p.m. — As the afternoon went on, hundreds remained at Jefferson Square Park, undeterred by the beaming sun and 91-degree temperature.

Speakers included rapper Jack Harlow, NBA player D'Angelo Russell and state Rep. and Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Charles Booker. ""This is a sustainable protest right now,"" said Russell, who attended Central High School in Louisville. ""This is peaceful. Everybody wants to be here and ... see change from this day on."" • 4 p.m. — Nearly 100 people gathered in Louisville's West End — roughly a block away from where law enforcement fatally shot David McAtee less than a week ago — to march to Jefferson Square Park in a prayer walk. The walk marks the 10th-consecutive day of demonstrations in Louisville. Cherrie Vaughn, the 42-year-old from Louisville who organized the prayer walk, said she will continue marching until there is substantive change. For Vaughn, prayer can help with that goal. ""Nothing has changed. People are not locked up. And so we won't stop,"" she said. ""...I just believe that if we keep praying and trusting God, things have to change."" Friday • 10:15 p.m. — Many demonstrators gathered in front of the federal courthouse in downtown Louisville as the 10 p.m. hour approached.

Broadway. • 9 p.m. — A portrait of Breonna Taylor was projected onto the side of Metro Hall as fireworks went off and people chanted ""Happy Birthday Breonna Taylor."" Jaylin Stewart, a 24-year-old artist, activist and teacher in Louisville, stayed up all night creating the portrait after coming up with the idea Friday. She said it was ""time for me to respond"" and ""I couldn't just sit back."" ""This is just a reminder the city will not be silent until she gets the justice that she deserves,"" Stewart said. Beforehand, hundreds of people took a knee for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, or the amount of time a Minneapolis police officer kneed on the neck of George Floyd, killying him. Several chanted Floyd's last words: ""They're going to kill me."" • 8:30 p.m. — Hundreds of protesters began marching downtown on Sixth Street, turning right on Main Street and heading east. Chants of ""say her name, Breonna Taylor"" and ""no justice, no police, prosecute the police"" rang throughout the crowd. • 8:15 p.m. — Protesters stood in Jefferson Square Park with fists raised in the air as a woman sang a rendition of ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" by Sam Cooke. • 7:15 p.m. — State Rep. Charles Booker, who represents Louisville and is a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, told the crowd ""don't ever be quiet again."" ""We're not alone. Look at this crowd — it's a whole lot of us,"" Booker said. ""We can change the world with just these people right here. So know if you lead, you're not by yourself, because you've gotta lead right now."" Brandon McCormack, an assistant professor in the Department of Pan-African Studies at the University of Louisville, said he attended the protest to support his students.

McCormack asked educators in downtown Louisville, or will we dismantle systems of racism to help Black students. • 6:30 p.m. — On the steps of Metro Hall, speakers addressed the crowd of more than 1,000 young people gathered in downtown Louisville.

Quintez Brown, a rising junior at the University of Louisville and Courier Journal intern, said “black women are still the most disrespected people in our society.” “I think it's past time we celebrate black women,"" Brown said ""It's time we listen to black women. It's time we heal black women, it's time we uplift black women!” • 4 p.m. — A youth-led march kicked off at Waterfront Park. Jalo Morton, 18, said she and other youth were marching in honor Breonna Taylor's memory but also for change. The Male High School graduate said, ""This is our future. 'Are we next' is... 'Are we next to die? Are we next to take office and take the torch that our generation has passed down for years and educate our peers on what should have been taught to everybody else."" Meanwhile, a group of teachers began their own march at Sixth and Cedar. Many wore shirts that said, ""JCPS teachers stand up for Black students."" All three groups met up at Jefferson Square Park for Louisville's eigth night of protests. • 2 p.m. — A crowd of youth gathered at Cardinal Stadium with balloons and signs to mark Taylor's birthday.

Heavy rains are pushing through Louisville this evening, though The Courier Journal's Alfred Miller reports several hundred demonstrators have still packed the downtown park for the eighth night in a row. A few LMPD officers are out among the crowd, including Rachel Arroyo, who passed out pamphlets encouraging people to join the police force and help be a part of a systematic change.

""Obviously, we need your buy-in, as citizens here, in lifting this curfew,"" Fischer said, warning that he could reinstate it if he sees violent behavior arise. At the same press conference, Assistant Chief of Louisville Metro Police Joshua Judah said protests have been peaceful over the past few years. However, he said after demonstrators disperse, ""violent and destructive"" looting has taken place, with several officers coming under gunfire. • 11 a.m. — Louisville Metro Council President David James criticized Mayor Greg Fischer's administration and several police department tactics to state representatives Thursday morning. Speaking to the interim joint committee on judiciary, James expressed frustration over the police department's decision to deploy tear gas on what appeared to be a peaceful crowd in Jefferson Square Park gathered before the city's curfew. City officials have said the protest, in part, was broken up due to the presence of leaf blowers. Assistant Chief of Police LaVita Chavous has said they can be used to ""block back chemicals into police's faces or blow back the gas, chemicals that we may use in an effort so that they can continue to be out there protesting and causing problems."" James said Thursday he did not like that explanation, and that police officers should have approached people with leaf blowers, not fire tear gas on the crowd. Overall, James said that the police department's lack of leadership has led to a public distrust in the law enforcement officers. He also said the lack of body cameras and answers from police in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in her own home on March 13 has been especially frustrating. Wednesday • 11:10 p.m — Protesters marched down Broadway once again Wednesday night after 11 p.m. to express anger over the Breonna Taylor and David McAtee, who were shot and killed by law enforcement officials in Louisville. Another group of protesters had marched through the Highlands. Their caravan followed an afternoon that saw several other protests pop up around the city. One group of a couple hundred people rallied in the afternoon in St. Matthews, blocking traffic on Shelbyville Road at one point as police looked on, and other demonstrations in Shively and along Bardstown Road near Douglass Boulevard. • 10:30 p.m — The caravan of protesters that had marched again through the Highlands Wednesday night had reached Highland Avenue and Bardstown Road as 10:30 p.m. approached. That same corner was the site of a notable incident Saturday night in which police broke up protesters with tear gas and pepper balls. But no law enforcement personnel had been seen trailing the protesters Wednesday night, Krauth said. The scene at 26th Street and Broadway, meanwhile, was quiet Wednesday night, The Courier Journal's Matt Glowicki reported, after two nights of large crowds. • 9:30 p.m — Protesters who have been marching through the city for the seventh night in a row have moved through the Highlands onto Cherokee Road, with those at the front of the pack turning onto Grinstead Drive at around 9:30 p.m. The Courier Journal's Olivia Krauth is traveling with the group and said a growing number of cars are joining the demonstrators in a caravan behind them, with some hanging out of windows and sunroofs to chant with those walking. Some of the cars have young children in them, Krauth said, joining in with chants of their own. The group followed a similar route last night, starting downtown and snaking through the Highlands before eventually heading back down Broadway and into the West End. Many were out with that group into the early hours of the morning.

The protest in St. Matthews broke up a little after 8 p.m., but around 1,000 people marching through downtown were still going strong as the sun set Wednesday night. They started at Jefferson Square Park, The Courier Journal's Olivia Krauth reported, before heading north up Sixth Street to River Road and circling back on Third Street. As 9 p.m. approached, the group had made its way to the corner of Chestnut and Shelby streets, heading toward Baxter Avenue. Some stopped along the way to pass out supplies to homeless people they had passed, as four helicopters hovered overhead. By 9 p.m., the group had reached Broadway, heading east.

Several were carrying burning sage sticks, The Courier Journal's Olivia Krauth reported, as a cleansing gesture. They were among the more than 1,000 people who walked from Jefferson Square Park down Sixth Street to River Road, where they turned around and headed back up Third Street just after 8 p.m. They had just passed Muhammad Ali Boulevard as 8:30 p.m. approached. I'm not a good judge of crowd size, but probably over 1,000 folks marching through downtown #Louisville protesting against police brutality. pic.twitter.com/kRvJpLzjjr — Olivia Krauth (@oliviakrauth) June 4, 2020 There wasn't much of a police presence, Krauth said, other than a few officers who had mingled with protesters by the Hall of Justice. Earlier in the evening, the crowd had a cathartic session where the mic was passed around to anyone who wanted to say their piece, as protesters ate donated pizza and sandwiches and listened. The protest in St. Matthews, The Courier Journal's Sarah Ladd reported, broke up a little after 8 p.m., after a couple hundred demonstrators hit the streets earlier in the evening along Shelbyville Road. Others had gathered in Shively. And at the Kroger 28th Street and Broadway, near the site of David McAtee's business, The Courier Journal's Matt Glowicki reported a large LMPD vehicle had been clearing the mostly empty parking lot. That grocery store was closed Tuesday after being targeted by looters. • 8 p.m — Protesters in St. Matthews took a minute to kneel in a moment of silent on Shelbyville Road to recognize Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed by police in March. They didn't have to ask, organizers told The Courier Journal's Sarah Ladd. St. Matthews Police officials at the scene approached the protesters and offered to hold the road open for them. The St. Matthews Police just held traffic back so these protesters could kneel in the street for a moment of silence @courierjournalpic.twitter.com/TLoCNwcmbe — Sarah Ladd (@ladd_sarah) June 3, 2020 The protesters at Jefferson Square Park, Courier Journal reporter Olivia Krauth said, had taken to the streets just before 8 p.m. and were walking downtown to River Road before turning around at Fourth Street. The park at Sixth and Jefferson streets has been the site of nightly protests throughout the week that have often spilled into nearby streets with marches. • 7:40 p.m — Hundreds have remained at Jefferson Square Park to rally in honor of Breonna Taylor and David McAtee. The Courier Journal's Olivia Krauth said the scene was peaceful, with the crowd in a healing mood. Plans were being made to walk through downtown, one organizer said. #LouisvilleProtests: Several hundred at Jefferson Square, peacefully discussing oppression, accountability, the police.  Very much a healing vibe for a breezy golden hour tonight. pic.twitter.com/snpZLAWTiI — Olivia Krauth (@oliviakrauth) June 3, 2020 Protesters in St. Matthews, meanwhile, briefly took to Shelbyville Road, chanting and holding up signs as they walked down the streets against traffic, before being moved back to the sidewalk by police. The scene has been peaceful, The Courier Journal's Sarah Ladd reported. Organizers at the scene like Montez Jones said they were pleased that the rally had remained peaceful but that they intended to keep at it until those officers who shot and killed Taylor in March faced consequences. • 7 p.m — The protest in St. Matthews has grown. Courier Journal reporter Sarah Ladd estimated there were around 200 people at the corner of Shelbyville and Breckinridge roads as of 7 p.m., with cars honking at them as they passed along the busy intersection. Someone delivered pizzas and smoothies to the crowd and another man offered the protesters masks as the group chanted Breonna Taylor's name and laid out its demands, including an end to no-knock warrants and more transparent investigations into officers accused of wrongdoing. Here in St. Matthews, a crowd is out to join other groups around the city that are protesting the death of #BreonnaTaylor#LouisvilleProtests#ICantBreathe#SayHerName#NoJusticeNoPeacepic.twitter.com/E1aqEY22DZ — Sarah Ladd (@ladd_sarah) June 3, 2020 Camille Hurt, leading one of the chants, told Ladd that the protesters were out there to ""demand that we be seen and heard."" Hurt added that she was wary of officers who had walked with protesters in the past few nights, saying she hoped their intentions were good but was concerned that the walks were more about optics. • 6:30 p.m — Dr. Sarah Moyer doesn't want those in the crowd at protests this week to forget about the coronavirus. Moyer, Louisville's director of the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness, reminded the city in a release that COVID-19 tests are free, and those who plan to attend demonstrations that bring out a lot of people should still exercise precautions, such as using face masks and hand sanitizer and stay in a small group. “We encourage those who have been participating in the demonstrations since last Thursday to get a free COVID-19 test,” Moyer's statemen. “They can get tested through their healthcare providers or at other locations that are posted on our website.” • 6:15 p.m — Another evening, another batch of protests around Louisville. Demonstrations to remember Breonna Taylor and David McAtee have popped up around the city once again Wednesday evening, the seventh night since the protests began downtown last Thursday. A crowd has gathered in St. Matthews near the malls, gesturing at cars driving along Shelbyville Road. And in the Highlands, The Courier Journal's Bobby Shipman reported, peaceful protesters lined up along the road near Douglass Loop with signs and cheers as cars driving along honked back at them. Families and other groups stood on all four corners of the intersection of Bardstown Road and Douglass Boulevard, with the sun still high. Protesters have hit Bardstown Road more than once during the week of demonstrations, including notable demonstrations on Saturday and Tuesday. A group was gathered once again at Jefferson Square Park as well. Jules, one of the speakers at the protest, said she is an Arab-American who passes as white. Black people, she said, ""are the people of color who need our hope the most."" ""They're the house that's burning on fire in a neighborhood full of oppressed people,"" she said. ""And we're not going to ignore the fire just because everyone else, just because all the other houses matter."" • 6 p.m — Russell resident Haven Harrington didn’t know McAtee well himself but he was well aware of his standing in the neighborhood, he told Courier Journal reporter Matt Glowicki on Wednesday as he returned to the scene of the early Monday shooting. Harrington came to the gathering outside of David McAtee’s business Tuesday trying to make sense of what had happened. He's watched the video released by police but questioned the lack of body camera footage and said it didn't seem like McAtee -- ""The man fed the cops for free,"" Harrington said. He was taken by surprise at the size and consistency of the groups who have gathered on Louisville’s streets over the past week. “It’s patently obvious to everybody locally, nationally and internationally that the way our criminal justice system interacts with black communities is broken,” he said. “And personally I think it’s by design. It’s designed to overcriminalize, to overpolice black communities. And you can only overpolice, harass people to a point. There comes a breaking point.” Sporting a 2007 Russel neighborhood Jazz Festival T-shirt, Harrington pointed to the Kroger across the street. Damage the store took in a Tuesday looting was troubling, he said. “But I understand where the anger is coming from, and I understand why people are lashing out,” he added. • 5:30 p.m — A group of law enforcement officers helped protesters in downtown Louisville load packs of water bottles in their cars. On Saturday, Louisville law enforcement officers smashed milk jugs and cases of water protesters had stockpiled on corners. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said at the time that Mason jars full of flammable materials were included in the protesters' pile of supplies, along with other materials he could not yet identify that could have harmed protesters as well as police. Meanwhile, one of the protesters downtown, Tasha West, a 33-year-old licensed practical nurse from Louisville, spoke out against no-knock warrants — which was used to enter Breonna Taylor's home. ""Not only are you putting the people at jeopardy, you're putting your officers at jeopardy as well,"" she said of the warrants. Kenneth Walker, Taylor's boyfriend, fired at officers when he thought the home was being invaded. Officers returned fire, killing Taylor. • 4:45 p.m — Humana has committed $11.5 million staff volunteer hours to “advance healing and equity,"" according to Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who said the Louisville-based health care provider planned to make this investment before the demonstrations, but that the protests may have impacted the amount. Beshear gave a brief update on the Kentucky State Police investigation into the fatal shooting of David McAtee. He said he has been ""impressed"" by the team investigating and that ""we're going to get it right."" Kentucky Executive Cabinet Secretary J. Michael Brown said the Kentucky State Police believes that one bullet struck McAtee in the chest. They are running tests on the bullet fragments. Brown said all of the Louisville Metro Police officers and National Guard members not involved in the shooting but at the scene have been interviewed. • 4:30 p.m. — Two university presidents joined protesters at Jefferson Square Park to show their support: Neeli Bendapudi, of the University of Louisville, and Tori Murden McClure, of Spalding University. Meanwhile, Charles Booker, a state representative from Louisville and Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, held a press conference with protesters at Jefferson Square Park. Booker said David McAtee, who was shot and killed by law enforcement Monday morning, was an ""anchor"" of the community, but that recent video released by Louisville Metro Police pose more questions. Booker also said he reached out to Beshear about the National Guard taking a ""step back"" and how they should not come to the West End. • 4 p.m. — Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said that the Kentucky State Police does not have an update to the investigation of the fatal shooting of David McAtee from Monday morning. Meanwhile, protesters returned to Jefferson Square Park to demand justice for Breonna Taylor. Another group gathered outside of City Hall Wednesday afternoon, where Metro Council's public safety committee is discussing no-knock warrant legislation • 11 a.m. — Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer urged protesters to vote in order to create substantive change. He also announced that the city is submitting a request for proposal for a comprehensive, ""top-to-bottom"" review of the Louisville Metro Police Department by an outside agency. The review will focus on training, bias and accountability, among other things. The Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization, will conduct Louisville's search for a new police chief. Interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Robert Schroeder said during the press briefing about 20 people were arrested in Louisville last night. He also said shots were fired at a SWAT armored vehicle, and no officers were hurt. Tuesday • Midnight — Law enforcement personnel in military police gear hugged, shook hands and fist-bumped with peaceful protesters walking down Broadway as midnight approached. The group, being filmed by Courier Journal visual journalist Jeff Faughender and reporter Mandy McLaren, was walking back downtown from the Highlands with a caravan of cars when they encountered police lined along the side of the street under an overpass. It was a tense scene for a moment. The crowd stopped, protesters held their hands up and chanted. But the police didn't lift their guns, and as some in the crowd approached, the two sides came to an embrace.

Bailey that they did not plan to leave for a while – but others left to go home or to other spots around town. A large number of protesters, meanwhile, have gathered once again in the Highlands, which was the site of a major demonstration on Saturday. • 9:45 p.m. — A candlelight vigil began at around 9:30 p.m. Tuesday night by Dino's Food Mart, where David McAtee was shot and killed by law enforcement personnel early Monday morning.

Some came out of their residences to show support for the crowd, while others in the group of protesters shot off fireworks and chanted. • 9:15 p.m. — A brief panic overtook protesters marching through downtown Louisville, The Courier Journal's Mandy McLaren reported, when someone on an Omni Louisville Hotel balcony threw ice down toward those walking down the street. The woman was later evicted as a result of the incident on Wednesday. The crowd, wary of police, started to sprint backwards before seeing that it was only ice, and not worse. • 9 p.m. — Curfew has fallen once again in Louisville, and protesters are still in the streets. A group downtown had gathered at Jefferson Square Park, according to The Courier Journal's Mandy McLaren, where earlier Tuesday evening Mayor Greg Fischer made an appearance, after marching through the streets of downtown, at one point kneeling on Broadway. . Police did not have a major presence at the scene at that time, McLaren said. At the corner of 26th Street and Broadway, meanwhile, a group was sill congregated to remember the life of David McAtee. The scene was more of a celebration of McAtee's life, The Courier Journal's Phillip M. Bailey said, than an organized protest. • 8:40 p.m. — Yaya's BBQ isn't going anywhere, David McAtee's nephew told The Courier Journal on Tuesday. Marvin McAtee, in a conversation with The Courier Journal's Phillip M. Bailey, said he intends to keep the corner barbecue shop running in the aftermath of David McAtee's Monday killing by law enforcement. The scene at the corner Tuesday night resembled a block party -- those at the scene were mourning, Bailey and correspondent Johnathan Bullington said, but also seemed to be celebrating McAtee's life.

Bailey said. Music was blaring at 8:15 p.m., though the scene was calm, Bailey said. Those at the corner plan to light candles when the sun goes down and remember the life of the 53-year-old West End ""community pillar."" Check out the video. Meanwhile, protesters knelt at First Street and Broadway while a crowd continued its demonstration in downtown Louisville. • 7:50 p.m. — Jefferson Square Park has filled up with protesters once again, their numbers growing as the city inches toward curfew. Meanwhile, you can smell the barbecue in the air at Dino's Food Mart, according to Courier Journal reporter Johnathan Bullington. Dozens were still gathered at the site of Monday's shooting. Lynnell Blakemore was in that crowd. She met McAtee more than two years ago and had become friends with the local business owner and didn't have it in her to go to the scene on the day he was killed.

It smells like really good barbecue pic.twitter.com/vDb53jfpAC — Jonathan Bullington (@jrbullington) June 2, 2020 Other protests have taken place today across town, including one in the evening on the University of Louisville's campus. The protests have spread to some smaller Kentucky towns as well. Protesters lined up in Harlan, according to the Ohio Valley ReSource, and the Bowling Green Daily News reported a demonstration was taking place in Glasgow. • 7:10 p.m. — In a media teleconference, Louisville Metro Police Chief of Public Safety said 125 people have been arrested at protests since they began in the city last week. Of those arrested, 116 had been released as of Tuesday evening. Most arrests, The Courier Journal's Darcy Costello reported, were for unlawful assembly, public intoxication or mischief, although there have been a smaller number of arrests for curfew violation. • 6:30 p.m. — Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Robert Schroeder showed up downtown around 6 p.m., and Fischer took the mic and gave a brief address to the crowd about systematic changes he believed were necessary before fielding some questions from those gathered at Jefferson Square Park. ""If this isn't a wake up call for the United States of America, then we need a gut check on what our country is,"" Fischer said. ""Because this is what our country is."" Those in the crowd asked about the Breonna Taylor case as well as where the city goes from here. Fischer took heat for his answer about why the officers who killed Taylor have not been arrested – that the investigation is still ongoing and he's following state law. The mayor also called for police to act as community guardians, not warriors. • 4 p.m. — Gov. Andy Beshear said the National Guard will reduce its presence in Louisville. The recommendation came from the Guard itself, Beshear said. He said he would not disclose the numbers of men and women on duty in Louisville for public safety reasons. • 1 p.m. — LMPD released additional footage they allege shows McAtee shooting a gun before officers returned fire. ""The video appears to show Mr. McAtee firing a gun outside of his business door as officers who are using pepper balls to clear the Dino's lot were approaching,"" Schroeder said. ""The video does not provide all the answers, but we are releasing it to provide transparency."" The morning after: What happened at Monday's David McAtee and Breonna Taylor protests Monday • 11:30 p.m. — Two subjects fired shots during Monday night's protest, LMPD acting Chief Robert Schroeder said at a Monday night press briefing, but no one was injured. Three arrests were made, he said. At the same press briefing, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer apologized that David McAtee's body was left at the scene of his fatal shooting into the afternoon on Monday but praised the crowd who gathered at the scene. McAtee was shot just after midnight on Monday, but his body remained at the scene at Dino's Food Mart in the West End until after noon. Fischer said his initial reaction was ""incredulous,"" but it was explained to him that a normal homicide investigation takes seven or eight hours, and this case was being dealt with by just six investigators who needed to speak to around 100 witnesses. The crowd, though, was ""incredible."" The people were respectful, he said, given the difficult circumstances. • 11 p.m. — A fire started at Dino's Food Mart, the site of the overnight law enforcement shooting of David McAtee, but fire crews got it under control. It was later reported that the fire was caused by a Molotov cocktail. • 10:40 p.m. — The scene has quieted in downtown Louisville after police broke up a protest at Jefferson Square Park. In the meantime, a crowd remained at 26th Street and Broadway, the site where law enforcement personnel shot and killed local barbecue business owner David McAtee overnight. Back at Dino's Food Mart, where Courier Journal reporter Sarah Ladd has remained throughout the evening, an estimated crowd of around 100 was still holding its ground, with no law enforcement around, other than a helicopter overhead and a lone police cruiser that kept moving as it passed the parking lot. • 10:10 p.m. — Police moved in on protesters who remained on the street at Seventh and Jefferson streets, dispersing the crowd with flash bangs and tear gas just after 10 p.m. Dozens initially stuck around as police blocked off the end of the street and advanced. But the law enforcement personnel flooded the streets with tear gas, flushing out protesters into the surrounding region. Police hit protesters at Jefferson Square Park with tear gas before the 9 p.m. curfew on Sunday, in a tactic some city officials questions. Later in the evening. Loud bangs continued to be heard in the region after 10:10 p.m. Monday night as police continued to clear the area, and one person was shown on WDRB being dragged off by police. • 10 p.m. — Police in SWAT gear have arrived at the ongoing protest at Jefferson Square Park. • 9:50 p.m. — As cars honking at protesters blare into the night, law enforcement personnel still haven't made their presence known at the ongoing protest in downtown Louisville, The Courier Journal's Sarah Ladd and Alton Strupp report. But some in the crowd are uneasy. The crowd thinned out a bit after 9 p.m., Ladd said, as organizers warned those in attendance that they may be confronted as the curfew had expired. • 9:30 p.m. — A large crowd of protesters is gathered at Jefferson Square Park in downtown Louisville 30 minutes past curfew, and many appear to have no intention of leaving. A group of speakers, shown in a live Courier Journal video, used a megaphone to address the crowd approaching 9:30 p.m. The speakers told those in the crowd that if they wanted to avoid a potential clash with the police, they should leave now, as one speaker referenced President Donald Trump's vow earlier Monday to deploy military to cities dealing with unruly protests. Courier Journal photojournalist Alton Strupp did not see any law enforcement personnel at the scene but described it as a ""waiting game"" to see what happens next. And one protester he spoke with, Taylin Moore, described the situation as a chess game – the police and protesters, she said, are thinking over their next moves. ""Just because they are quiet doesn’t mean they will stay quiet. And neither will we,” said Moore, who also described the firing of LMPD Chief Steve Conrad earlier in the day as ""scapegoat tactics."" • 8:50 p.m. — One of the LMPD officers who marched with protesters down Broadway toward the site of Monday morning's shooting said he came out because ""I want to be with the people."" ""I’m from this area, and when I came here, I made an oath in 2013 to protect and serve the people. I take that to heart,"" Officer Isaac Sowells told The Courier Journal's Mandy McLaren. ""I love these people down here. I never forget where I came from. Every one of these people – I’m with them.” Sowells is from Louisville's West End, which has been rocked by Monday morning's fatal shooting by law enforcement of local barbecue business owner David McAtee. He was one of at least three LMPD officers to march with protesters on Broadway from downtown to the site of the shooting on 26th Street on Monday evening. The officers stayed at the scene for a bit and talked to protesters. Many of the protesters who had marched down Broadway had turned around and headed back toward downtown by 8:45 p.m., McLaren said. Louisville's curfew goes into effect at 9 p.m. • 8:30 p.m. — Around 1,000 people have congregated at 26th Street and Broadway, where law enforcement personnel shot and killed David McAtee overnight. One group has been stationed at the business, Dino's Food Mart, all day, including while police were in the area Monday morning and early afternoon. The other group marched up Sixth Street in downtown Louisville to Broadway, where they blocked traffic as they chanted. Some walked arm-in-arm with at least three LMPD officers with the crowd. Many of the protesters in that group stayed at the corner for some time before turning around and heading back downtown. • 7:30 p.m. — Protests continued downtown and at the site where David McAtee was killed. At least three LMPD officers marched arm-in-arm with several hundred protesters down Sixth Street, according to Courier Journal reporter Mandy McLaren, chanting the names of Breonna Taylor and David McAtee, and ""No justice, no peace, prosecute the police"" as a helicopter hovered overheard. Watch McLaren's video from the scene here. Some cars honked in solidarity and drivers threw up their fists out of their windows as the group hit Broadway and cut off traffic as it made its way toward 18th Street and beyond. • 6:20 p.m. — The FBI Louisville has initiated an investigation into David McAtee's death, spokesman Nicholas Storm said, alongside Kentucky State Police and the U.S. Attorney's Office. ""We understand this community’s need for answers and we will assess all the information, and will take any appropriate action that is warranted by the facts and the law,"" Storm said in a statement. • 5:30 p.m. — Protesters have remained at Dino's Food Mart throughout the day in a protest following David McAtee's overnight shooting. Gov. Andy Beshear spoke to reporters in Frankfort at 5:30 p.m. The governor earlier Monday said he expected body camera footage from McAtee's shooting to tell more of the story as to what happened overnight. It was announced later in the day that the footage would not be available. In his afternoon address, Beshear said he was alerted to the shooting just after 3 a.m. Monday and he's been following the case all day, in search of the truth. Every other officer at the scene should have their body camera reviewed, he continued, because what happened early Monday was ""not OK."" ""It is unacceptable that the officers that responded last night did not have body cameras on and recording,"" Beshear said. • 4:30 p.m. — Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer fired Steve Conrad in a press briefing at 4 p.m. and announced a couple other important notes. Louisville's 9 p.m curfew has been extended to June 8. And acting Chief Rob Schroeder said the failure to record what happened was a department policy violation and a review of the incident will reveal whether any other violations occurred. The department will review the incident to determine whether any other policy violations occurred, and there ""will be discipline"" for failing to use cameras, Schroeder said. Louisville's 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. curfew will also remain in effect until June 8, Fischer said.

On Monday afternoon, Mayor Greg Fischer fired Conrad, effective immediately, after learning that officers at the fatal shooting of popular eatery owner David McAtee did not have their body cameras turned on. ""This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,"" said Fischer, who later added that ""an immediate change in leadership is required."" Both LMPD officers and National Guard soldiers fired their weapons early Monday morning, killing McAtee, the owner of YaYa's BBQ in western Louisville, after officials said someone shot at LMPD officers from a parking lot at 26th and Broadway. The incident is under state, federal and local police investigation. Conrad, who served as chief for eight years, had said last month he would retire at the end of June amid increasing pressure in the wake of a different fatal police shooting: that of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old ER technician who was killed March 13 in her apartment. But Fischer said it had become clear in recent days that the city could not wait for a change in leadership. Read more: Investigation launched into fatal shooting of West End restaurant owner CLOSE People say they're ""angry"" and ""want justice"" after popular a barbecue restaurant owner, David McAtee, was shot and killed Monday by law enforcement. Louisville Courier Journal He relieved Conrad of his duties and put Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder in charge as interim police chief after finding out that the officers had not activated their body cameras at the McAtee shooting, violating policy that has been the subject of much scrutiny in recent weeks. There is no body camera footage of the fatal shooting of McAtee or Taylor. The officers in the Taylor case were not required to wear body cameras because they were in the Criminal Interdiction Unit. The city has since revised that policy. Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that Conrad's firing ""had to happen."" ""Two incidences of this significance, no body cameras — it had to happen,"" Beshear said. ""It was the right move."" Council President David James, D-6th District, a frequent critic of the chief, said he was saddened ""that it took this much calamity in our city to remove the chief of police."" Fischer's decision to remove Conrad from office brings to an end several turbulent years for the former chief, who led a department through scandals and a skyrocketing homicide rate. His retirement announcement in mid-May said it had been the ""highlight of my professional career to be Louisville's police chief."" A spokeswoman for the department had said at the time that the mayor had not asked Conrad to resign. 'My son didn't hurt nobody': David McAtee, business owner, killed by authorities On Monday, however, Fischer made clear that he had immediately removed Conrad of his duties. Despite the firing, Conrad will still receive payment for any days earned and will still have his pension, Fischer said. Earlier in the day, Beshear had called for camera footage — ""body camera and otherwise"" — from the incident to be released so that Kentuckians could ""see for themselves"" whether the actions taken by law enforcement were justified or cause for more concern. It's not clear when he was made aware that Louisville Metro Police officers on scene were not recording body camera footage. In an evening press briefing, Beshear said he hopes that Louisville protesters see that ""steps are being taken"" and that they know he recognizes some of the facts that have come out about McAtee's fatal shooting were ""not acceptable."" ""Before people can have trust that we will work for change, they've got to see that things make you mad, too,"" he said. ""… People need to know that you care, that you're vested, that you're committed to doing what's right. ""Now is a chance to get things right. And I hope those tonight can believe in that sincerity and can give us that opportunity."" Ryan Nichols, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police representing Louisville Metro Police officers, said he didn't know all of Fischer's specific reasons for firing Conrad but said he doubts it will be a ""magic bullet"" to quell protesters. ""If it helps in any way, then that's good,"" Nichols said. Outcry over the fatal police shooting of Taylor has rocked Louisville in recent weeks and, since Thursday, has led to nightly protests with hundreds of people flocking to downtown streets to demand justice. Scrutiny on city leaders and police has led to several policy changes, including expanded body camera requirements and the suspension of no-knock warrants.

Louisville Courier Journal Criminal charges against Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were dismissed, pending further investigation. And Fischer has called for a civilian review board of the police department to have subpoena powers. But apparent violations of policy in yet another fatal police shooting proved a bridge too far for Fischer's loyalty to Conrad, who weathered several high-profile scandals. The Louisville native began with the Louisville Police Department as a patrol officer in 1980, rising to assistant chief in what later became Louisville Metro Police, before leaving to head the police force in Glendale, Arizona. He took over as chief of Louisville Metro Police in 2012. During his tenure, he was praised for some transparency efforts, but support eroded amid a spiking murder rate. The Fraternal Order of Police and Louisville Metro Council cast no-confidence votes in his leadership in 2016 and 2017, respectively. On top of the homicides, the department faced scandals that included the revelation that officers had sexually assaulted teens in the department's youth Explorer Scout program. A report by a former U.S. attorney found ""violations of police and mistakes in judgment, some significant"" by department leaders. It also reported that Conrad aborted an investigation into one of the officers, allowing him to resign instead of be fired. More recently, amid the nationwide attention on the fatal police shooting of Taylor, Fischer's support of his chief flagged and he declined to say he had faith in Conrad's leadership. Before his firing, Conrad had planned to stay on as head of the agency through the end of the budget cycle. Under a restructuring, Schroeder will report to Amy Hess, the chief of public safety, rather than directly to Fischer.

The medical examiner's report released Monday listed ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression"" as the cause of death. It came hours after Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump held a press conference to announce the findings of a family-commissioned autopsy. The family autopsy stated ""asphyxiation from sustained pressure was the cause"" of Floyd's death. Dr. Michael Baden and Dr. Allecia Wilson performed the autopsy and said there was ""neck and back compression that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain,"" Crump said Monday. They added that ""weight on the back, handcuffs and positioning were contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to function."" Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes while he was handcuffed on the ground, crying that he couldn't breathe and pleading for help. The incident has galvanized outrage, sparking protests and violence throughout the U.S. Monday's medical examiner's report indicates that its finding ""is not a legal determination of culpability or intent, and should not be used to usurp the judicial process."" That autopsy found ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,"" according to the document, which suggests Floyd’s existing health conditions – coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease – combined with being restrained by police and any ""potential intoxicants in his system"" contributed to his death. Baden and Wilson said it appeared that Floyd died at the scene. Follow this story:For more on the investigation, protests and more, sign up to get the Daily Briefing ""What we found is consistent with what people saw,"" Baden said. ""There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death. Police have this false impression that if you can talk, you can breathe. That’s not true."" Crump had strong words on Floyd's death. ""For George Floyd, the ambulance was his hearse,"" he said. ""Beyond question, he would be alive today if not for the pressure applied to his neck by fired officer Derek Chauvin and the strain on his body from two additional officers kneeling on him. Mr. Floyd’s death was a homicide by officers who taunted him while holding him down for more than eight minutes. And the officer who stood by doing nothing was a physical blue shield – a living symbol of the code of silence."" Bystanders, who begged officers on the scene to intervene, recorded Floyd's death on video and shared the images on social media. After they went viral, Floyd's death sparked a week of protests in Minneapolis and most major U.S. cities. Floyd was arrested on suspicion of trying to use a forged $20 bill. Latest developments:George Floyd protests continue nationwide, 4,400 arrests reported; St. John's Church in DC set on fire Inside the criminal complaint:8 minutes, 46 seconds and 'inherently dangerous': What's in the criminal complaint in the George Floyd case Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. He is in custody in a state prison. Three other officers who were on the scene have not been detained or charged with any crimes. All four officers were fired the day after Floyd's death. Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that Attorney General Keith Ellison would lead prosecutions in Floyd’s death. ""We are going to bring to bear all the resources necessary to achieve justice in this case,"" Ellison said at a news conference. Activists have pressed Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to charge the other three officers and have demonstrated outside his house. Crump called for Chauvin's charge to be elevated to first-degree murder and for the other three officers involved at the scene to be arrested. ""What we must have is equal justice for the United States of America,"" Crump said. ""The family implores Attorney General Ellison to make equal justice real for black people in 2020 with getting those officers arrested immediately and charged to the fullest extent of the law so that we can believe that there is one justice system in America."" The city, like others across the nation, has been roiled by demonstrations. Arrests were made after an 8 p.m. curfew Sunday, but they were a tiny proportion of the thousands who peacefully marched around the city and across the Mississippi River bridges Sunday afternoon. Just south of downtown Minneapolis on Monday afternoon, art student Simone Alexa and three friends were busy painting a mural on a boarded-up storefront, an effort to bring a little beauty to a troubled city. They were happy that the results of a second autopsy were made public, believing the initial one felt like the beginning of a potential coverup. “I was surprised that we were able to get a coherent autopsy. So that’s good news,” said Andrew Hinrichs, a 26-year-old native of the Twin Cities. “I think it’s a step toward truth. I think it’s communication in the line of justice. The fact that we can now say for a fact that officer Chauvin’s actions asphyxiating (Floyd) killed him.” Alexa’s vision for the mural was to show the passing of the baton from 1960s-era civil rights leaders to today’s Black Lives Matter movement. It will list the names of victims of those struggles, 64 in all. Taylor Kaiser and Calvin Berg were also helping, a process that stretched on for four hours. Atop her mural, Alexa planned to have the names George Floyd and Martin Luther King Jr. in the largest lettering, side by side. She was hoping that the second autopsy is a sign that justice will happen in Minneapolis. “The protests aren’t going to stop until it does,” she said. The homicide declaration did nothing to placate Sharon Tomlinson of Minneapolis, standing feet from where Floyd died last Monday. “Will we get first-degree murder?” she asked. “We don’t want no third-degree murder because that only carries 12 1/2 years. I need a life sentence so that (Floyd’s) mother, his father, his kids will understand why we did this.” Tomlinson said she was arrested Sunday night while protesting on Interstate 35. She was released from jail at 4:30 a.m. Monday and planned to be back out that evening, confident that the demonstrators will get the outcome they seek. “If we stand together and we stand strong and we keep locking arms, we’ll have justice. I know it,” she said. Contributing: The Associated Press",0.0

Residents have taken to the streets of Louisville, like thousands of Americans around the country, to protest the killings of black people at the hands of police — specifically, George Floyd, who died after being pinned by the neck by a Minneapolis police officer, and Breonna Taylor, who was shot in her Louisville apartment in March by officers who were looking for someone else. At many protests across America, police have attacked protesters, beating them with batons, shooting them with rubber bullets, and driving cars into crowds. In downtown Louisville on Sunday night, police and the National Guard were sent to break up a crowd that had gathered in a parking lot, Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad said in a statement, according to NBC. Officers “were shot at,” Conrad said, and they “returned fire.” Now, a man is dead. On Monday, his family publicly identified him as David McAtee, the owner of a local restaurant. “He left a great legend behind,” his mother, Odessa Riley, told the Louisville Courier-Journal. “He was a good person.” Officials have not yet confirmed who fired the fatal shot. McAtee’s family has called for body camera footage from the incident to be released, but on Monday, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced that officers at the scene had their body cameras turned off, according to WFPL. The mayor also announced that Conrad had been fired from his position as police chief. While investigations are ongoing, here is what we know about the incident on Sunday that ended in McAtee’s death. What we know Police and the National Guard were sent to a parking lot at 26th and Broadway in Louisville on Sunday at about 12:15 am, according to NBC. Like many cities around the country in recent days, Louisville has imposed a curfew, which began at 9 pm. Police say they began shooting after being fired on by the crowd. “Officers and soldiers began to clear the lot and at some point were shot at,” Conrad said in his statement. “Both LMPD and national guard members returned fire.” David McAtee, 53, was fatally shot. McAtee owned a barbecue restaurant on the corner where the crowd had gathered. Riley, his mother, says he was a “community pillar,” known for giving free meals to police officers. “All he did on that barbecue corner is try to make a dollar for himself and his family,” she told the Courier-Journal. “And they come along and they killed my son.” Several sources say the crowd in the parking lot was not actually protesting when police arrived. One bystander told reporters they were not engaged in protest and were merely out past the city’s curfew. And McAtee’s sister told WAVE 3 News that McAtee and others meet in the area every Sunday night for food and music, and that her brother was serving food. What we don’t know According to NBC, Conrad did not specify who shot the man. However, the Louisville news station WLKY is reporting that he was shot by law enforcement. Police say they are collecting video and investigating the killing. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has ordered an independent investigation by state police. “Given the seriousness of the situation, I have authorized the Kentucky State Police to independently investigate the event,” he said in a statement Monday.

Fischer said Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad, who announced his resignation in May, has been fired, and a nightly 9 p.m.-to-6:30 a.m. curfew has been extended to June 8. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the fatal shooting by police and National Guard personnel.

About 100 people lined the sidewalk across the street from the LMPD line. Many lived in the neighborhood, and some said they'd been at other protests over the weekend. Monday afternoon, the Rev.

Declaring himself ""the president of law and order,"" Trump said during a Rose Garden address that he is dispatching “thousands and thousands” of military personnel and law enforcement personnel to Washington, D.C., to stop rioting, looting, vandalism and destruction of property. Trump also urged governors to use as many National Guard troops as possible to control violence and warned if they didn't, he would deploy the U.S. military ""and quickly solve the problem for them."" ""These are not acts of peaceful protest,"" Trump said of the unrest. ""These are acts of domestic terror."" Immediately after his remarks, Trump walked across nearby Lafayette Park and visited St. John's Church, which was set on fire by protesters Sunday night. Trump held up a Bible in front of the boarded-up church, which is referred to as the ""church of presidents."" St. John's was built in 1815 and has been attended at least once by every president since James Madison. Trump's actions come after six days of protests and riots in cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died last week while in police custody. Police officer Derrick Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Just minutes before Trump spoke in the Rose Garden and headed to St. John's, law enforcement officers cleared Lafayette Park with tear gas, rubber bullets, shields and horses. Though the Rose Garden was not within view of the protesters, reporters awaiting Trump’s speech reported hearing a series of loud booms. Critics suggested the decision to clear the park was linked to Trump's visit to the church. ""Were thousands of peaceful protestors just tear gassed so Trump could have a photo op?"" tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, a communications director for former President Barack Obama. Rabbi Jack Moline, president of Interfaith Alliance, also slammed Trump's visit to St. John's as a ""photo opp."" ""Seeing President Trump stand in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice – right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters out of the area – is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen,"" he said. ""This only underscores the president’s complete lack of compassion for black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism."" Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump developed a plan to provide more federal help to cities dealing with the unrest during meetings with Attorney General William Barr, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley. ""There will be additional federal assets deployed across the nation,"" she said. ""There will be a central command center in conjunction with the state and local governments."" Trump is also considering invoking the Insurrection Act, an 1807 federal law that would allow him to deploy active-duty U.S. troops to respond to protests in cities. It was last invoked in 1992 for the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. Trump made the announcement hours after urging governors to accept federal help. The president told the state executives that most of them have been ""weak"" in failing to confront violent demonstrators. ""You have to dominate,"" he said, according to audio of the meeting obtained by CBS News. ""If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate."" McEnany later said the focus of the call ""was the National Guard, encouraging deployment far more than the 17,000 out there and utilizing them this evening certainly."" More:'Most of you are weak': Trump rails at the nation's governors, urges crackdown on violence More:'Nowhere to be found': Governors blast Trump after he tells them they are 'weak' on phone call Some governors criticized Trump's criticism, with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, describing his comments as ""deeply disturbing."" ""The president repeatedly and viciously attacked governors, who are doing everything they can to keep the peace while fighting a once-in-a-generation global pandemic,"" Whitmer said in a statement. “The president’s dangerous comments should be gravely concerning to all Americans, because they send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division.""",0.0

Attica Scott insisted it is past time for the mayor and governor to make an appearance to back demonstrators. LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Many are looking to voices of their leaders to guide them through these uncertain times, but one leader says they should not be telling people how to feel during a time of hurt and pain. State rep. Attica Scott was at the scene of Monday morning's fatal shooting, questioning the decision made in recent days and wondering where we as a community go from this point. ""I am listening to people, rather than me trying to come and tell them how they should be in pain...how they should respond to hurt and anger and frustration,"" Scott said. ""That would be extremely inappropriate."" The Democrat representing Kentucky's 41st District Scott said she and her teenage daughter were hit by tear gas while participating in a peaceful protest this weekend. She has not heard from Gov. Andy Beshear after tweeting out what happened. Scott insisted it is past time for the mayor and governor to make an appearance to back demonstrators. The mayor spent moments at the shooting scene Monday before the crowd verbally turned on him and he left. During his Day of Reflection, Fischer discussed the weekend's protests. ""On the streets of our city, I saw a diverse group of people gather to honor Breonna Taylor and condemn racial injustice,"" Fischer said. ""People who recognize that this was never about black versus white, but right versus wrong."" Beshear called in the National Guard, something Rep. Scott said she felt was a mistake. When asked if he though the decision allowed things to escalate, he said the guard followed the lead of LMPD to disperse the crowd. The governor said that he wanted to let those who question his decision that he is aware and listening. He said not having body camera footage is completely unacceptable, and has asked Kentucky State Police to independently investigate. ""I do want those that are concerned about last night and the decision to know that we're listening,"" Beshear said. ""We're listening."" U.S. Senate candidate Charles Booker called the death of David McAtee a ""travesty,"" and said it was ""absolutely avoidable."" ""The decision to send an armed military force into the West End of Louisville is a clear escalation of an already tense situation,"" Booker said. ""I have not heard a reasonable explanation for why the National Guard was deployed to 26th and Broadway, or how their presence was intended to make our city any safer."" Booker said he spoke to both the mayor and governor, appearing in the mayor's press conference where he announced the release of LMPD Chief Steve Conrad. In a separate press conference, members of Metro Council joined together to call on Fischer to put resources toward completing Breonna Taylor's case by Friday. ""Enough is enough,"" council member Jessica Green said. ""We are just tired."" Council member Donna Purvis, who represents the district McAtee died in, asked why the shooting took place. “Why did we lose another life? I don’t understand it,"" Purvis said.

Why National Guard Was Armed",https://wfpl.org/pepper-balls-downtown-live-rounds-in-west-end-why-national-guard-was-armed/,en,False,,93009,wfpl.org,http://wfpl.org/#spider,"On Monday morning, in the wake of law enforcement fatally shooting David McAtee, there was a common refrain among mourners: why are they using pepper balls downtown and real bullets in the West End? Officials said the 400 Kentucky National Guard members deployed to Louisville are authorized to fire lethal weapons, like the ones that were fired upon David McAtee early Monday morning, when faced with an immediate threat. Though the CAR-15 carried by guardsmen are generally not loaded, members do carry ammunition. “Weapons that the Guardsmen are carrying are in self defense of imminent danger of life, limb or eyesight,” Maj. Stephen Martin, the director of the Kentucky National Guard’s Public Affairs Office said. Martin said he would need to confirm whether the Guard members are also equipped with the non-lethal weapons carried and utilized by other law enforcement in Louisville. The mayor extended the city’s curfew through June 8, raising the possibility the National Guard may be in the city through the week. Until Sunday night, non-lethal weapons such as teargas and pepper balls were used in response to protesters throughout the city, though LMPD officers are armed as usual. On Saturday night, when several shots were fired at LMPD officers during a protest at Ninth Street and Broadway, the officers did not return fire and used non-lethal weapons. That changed when members of the Louisville Metro Police Department and Kentucky National Guard shot and killed David McAtee outside a gas station at 26th and Broadway. Two Louisville officers and two National Guard members fired.  Officials including Gov. Andy Beshear and LMPD have said that law enforcement was fired on first. It’s unclear who might have fired, but no officials have suggested it had anything to do with McAtee, 53, who sold barbecue at the intersection. Mayor Greg Fischer described McAtee as a person who “got caught up” in the shooting. LMPD’s body cameras were not turned on, a realization that led Fischer to fire the police chief and the acting chief to promise discipline, and that means no official footage is available showing exactly what occurred. Facebook live footage from the scene and audio show a single shot fired before LMPD and National Guard open fire. “My understanding, at least by protocol is that showing up at the scene, they are not loaded and after the shooting occurred in order to protect themselves and address the situation, that’s the point when that happened,” Beshear said in a press conference on June 1. Brigadier General Hal Lamberton, Adjutant General of the Kentucky National Guard, said in the same press conference that most of the members of the guard currently deployed to Louisville are part of the National Guard Reaction Force, which undergoes training and weapons requirements specific to the assignment of dealing with civil unrest. KyCIR has asked for more details on those training requirements, but the National Guard has not yet responded. About 17,000 national guard troops have been deployed to 23 states and the District of Columbia in response to this weekend’s unrest, according to the Military Times. In Minnesota, the Adjutant General for Minnesota’s National Guard told reporters troops were carrying rifles, sidearms and ammunition after the FBI reported a “credible threat” made directly towards Guard members. This story has been corrected to note the number of National Guard members who fired their weapons.",0.0

Police said they were responding to gunfire from a crowd.The U.S. attorney said federal authorities will join state police in investigating the fatal shooting.Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer revealed that authorities lacked body camera video for the investigation just hours after Kentucky's governor demanded the release of police video.“This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,"" Fischer said. “Accordingly, I have relieved Steve Conrad of his duties as chief of Louisville Metro Police Department.”Gov. Andy Beshear later said the lack of body camera footage was unacceptable.“This is the entire reason that we have those cameras,"" the Democratic governor said at the state Capitol in Frankfort. “And every other officers’ cameras should be reviewed, and if they captured any part of the scene it ought to be released.”Beshear authorized state police to independently investigate the shooting. He pledged the probe will be conducted in an, “honest and transparent way that will not take months.”U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman announced that federal authorities will be part of the investigation.“We understand this community’s need for answers and we will assess all the information, and will take any appropriate action that is warranted by the facts and the law.” Coleman's office said.The governor said he had counted on body camera footage to help determine “the truth in a way that spoke for itself, at a time when trust is difficult and people deserve to be able to see and evaluate.""The shakeup at the top of the city's police department came a month earlier than expected. Conrad had previously announced his resignation, which was to take effect at the end of June. Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder will step in immediately as chief, Fischer said.The mayor also said the city's curfew was being extended until June 8.Police did retrieve video from crime center cameras that showed how the shooting unfolded, Schroeder said.“It is taken from a distance, but it gives an overview of the scene and clearly shows the officers reacting to gunfire,” he said.Two Louisville officers and two Guard soldiers returned fire, he said. The two officers violated policy by not wearing or activating body cameras, Schroeder said, adding they have been placed on administrative leave.McAtee, whose YaYa's BBQ Shack is near where the shooting occurred, was mourned by hundreds of people who returned to the site hours afterward.Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist and executive director of the group Game Changers, said McAtee was well-liked.“I’ve never known him to be aggressive in any kind of way,” he said.Schroeder agreed that McAtee was friendly to police officers. “Over the years he’s been a good friend to the police officers ... frequently making sure our officers had a good meal on their shifts,"" he said.Before his dismissal, Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. Monday outside a food market on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a group of people violating the city's curfew.Someone fired a shot at law enforcement officials, and both soldiers and officers returned fire, he said. Several “persons of interest” were being interviewed, he said.News outlets showed video taken by someone in a car parked at a gas station. It recorded the sound of bullets being fired as groups of police and Guard soldiers crouched behind cars.Kris Smith said he was at a restaurant — “just outside having a good time, having drinks, eating barbecue” — when the soldiers arrived.“As soon as I walk to my car they jump out with the sticks, the police jump out with their sticks and their shields and stuff on,"" Smith said. “It looked like something out of a movie. It looked like a freaking war zone.”He heard a loud noise, and a few minutes later gunfire, he said.Smith, who is black, said the group had nothing to do with the protests.“Never thought I would experience that here in America,” he said.Last week, before the National Guard was mobilized, seven people were wounded when gunshots erupted during a protest in downtown Louisville. Police said none of the seven, who are recovering, were shot by police. They have not announced any arrests.Protesters have been demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home.After Taylor's death, the mayor said Louisville police would be required to wear body cameras. Fischer said recently that officers in plainclothes units like the one that served a warrant at Taylor’s home would now wear the cameras during search warrants.Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, renewed her plea for peace Monday while demanding justice for her daughter.",0.0

At about 6:45 p.m. and without warning, law enforcement sent canisters of tear gas and smoke bombs hissing and spinning down the concrete, creating ear-rattling explosions and fireworks that caused panic in the streets and sent the crowd of hundreds stampeding for safety. The skirmish near the White House, which started at least 15 minutes before a citywide curfew took effect, came as Trump addressed the nation from the Rose Garden, where he promised to dispatch “thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting vandalism and the wanton destruction of property.” ADVERTISEMENT The high-decibel explosions were audible from the Rose Garden as the president spoke. Hundreds of protesters had flooded the streets around the White House as the clock ticked toward a 7 p.m. curfew that had been announced earlier in the day by Mayor Muriel Bowser (D). The streets around the White House were filled with with scores of police cars, armored vehicles and heavily armed military personnel squaring off with angry protesters, who were concentrated at the corner of 16th Street and H Street along Lafayette Square, which faces the White House. Law enforcement in riot gear carried shields and long guns as they guarded the perimeter of the park, standing face to face with jeering demonstrators, who were peaceful but verbally taunting toward law enforcement. On H Street, police on horseback and National Guardsmen held the line, pushing protesters west toward 17th Street. The multiracial crowd, most of them wearing face masks, buzzed with anger and chants of “black lives matter” and “these are our streets.” ADVERTISEMENT Many held signs honoring Floyd, the unarmed black man whose death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer has sparked national outrage and protests across the country. As the curfew neared, the crowd suddenly broke into a blind panic, running westbound on H Street as the sound of several loud booms echoed through the street. The police had unexpectedly fired tear gas and smoke bombs at the demonstrators without warning. The National Guard had been instructed to clear the area around the White House so the president could walk across the street to St. John’s Church, which had been set on fire by vandals the night before. Protesters collided as they tried to escape the smoke and gas, pleading with one another to stay orderly through the chaos to avoid a deadly stampede. Some retreated to the side of the road to pour water over their burning eyes as the streets filled with smoke and gas, making it difficult to breathe. The police would march for about 30 yards before stopping to create a new perimeter further down H Street. The crowd would stop too, returning to the front lines to chant at the police. Then again, without warning, the military would go on the march, shooting tear gas and smoke bombs into the crowd and igniting another panic among the demonstrators, who frantically sought a way out from the maze of downtown street closures. The crowd was eventually pushed back to 17th street, which was blocked by National Guardsmen from the north side, forcing protesters to flee southbound toward the Eisenhower Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House. The offensive from the police intensified, with tear gas and smoke bombs popping left and right as protesters sprinted away. By 7 p.m., the police had cleared all the streets surrounding the White House, creating a full perimeter that allowed the president to walk to the church across from Lafayette Square. At his speech in the Rose Garden, as chaos broke out around the White House, Trump demanded that state and local officials turn back the violent protests that have swept the nation. ADVERTISEMENT “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the U.S. military and quickly solve the problem for them.” Monday’s unrest marks the fourth night of violent demonstrations across dozens of cities in the U.S. As midnight approached protesters remained in the streets of D.C., skirmishing with a heavy law enforcement presence throughout the city. Helicopters swooped overhead and sirens could be heard. Floyd’s death has provoked roiling anger at law enforcement, igniting one of the most intense periods of civil unrest in modern times. Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin was arrested for murder after video emerged of him restraining Floyd by kneeling on his neck. Floyd died at the scene. The president has demanded that state and local officials crack down on incidents of arson, looting and vandalism that have taken place. ADVERTISEMENT There has been significant damage done to downtown Washington, with several landmarks defaced, including the Lincoln Memorial, the World War II Memorial and a statue of Brig. Gen. Casimir Pulaski. Trump briefly retreated to an underground bunker as the protests swelled around the White House on Friday night. Washington Police Chief Peter Newsham said 88 people were arrested on Sunday night. Half of those were charged with “felony rioting.”",0.0

Amid racial unrest across the nation, President Donald Trump on Monday declared himself “the president of law and order” and threatened to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the White House's idyllic Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Trump said he would mobilize “thousands and thousands"" of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park. The escalation came just after Attorney General William Barr came to the park to to survey the demonstrators. Minutes after his speech, Trump made a brief visit outside the 200-year-old church near the White House that was set on fire over the weeekend. Law enforcement cleared protesters out of the area with tear gas before Trump’s visit. Tear gas canisters could be heard exploding as Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. He then walked over to the church. The protesters appeared to be acting peacefully before they were dispersed by force. According to senior defense officials, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were being sent to Washington to provide assistance. Those troops were either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people. In extreme cases, however, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, also from the Civil War, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement. The officials said that some of the National Guard in D.C. will be armed and others will not. They said that the D.C. guard members do not have non-lethal weapons. The military police that are visible in the city are members of the Guard. The country has been beset by angry demonstrations for the past week in some of the most widespread racial unrest in the U.S. since the 1960s. Spurred in part by Floyd's death, protesters have taken to the streets to decry the killings of black people by police. In a conference call Monday with the nation's governors. Trump berated most of them as “weak” for not cracking down harder on the lawlessness that has convulsed cities from coast to coast. A medical examiner on Monday classified George Floyd’s death as a homicide, saying his heart stopped as police restrained him and suppressed his neck, in a widely seen video that has sparked protests across the nation. An autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said Monday. A Minneapolis police officer has been charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, and three other officers were fired. Bystander video showed the officer, Derek Chauvin, holding his knee on Floyd’s neck despite the man's cries that he couldn't breathe until he eventually stopped moving.",0.0

(Photo: AP file photo) CORRECTION: A jury found Officer Patrick Caton not guilty of a misdemeanor assault charge in 2001. As Roger Owensby Sr. watched the video of George Floyd take his last breath while pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis police officer, he could think of only one thing. “I feel like I’m watching my son die again.” Owensby's son, Roger Owensby Jr., died 20 years ago in Cincinnati in much the same way. Two Cincinnati police officers were charged: One was found not guilty; the other had a trial that ended with the jury deadlocked. For Owensby and many others, Floyd’s death - which has led to days of protests in cities nationwide - is a reminder of how much work the nation still must do to protect the lives and civil rights of minorities. “Nothing has changed in 20 years,” Owensby told The Enquirer by phone from his North Carolina home. But for some, it’s a reminder that progress, though often painfully slow, has been made in Cincinnati. Following the city’s unrest and riots in 2001 – which were fueled by anger over the deaths of Roger Owensby Jr. and 11 other black men who died at the hands of police – Cincinnati undertook a long, difficult effort to reform its police department. The city’s use-of-force policy is now one of the most progressive in the country because of changes after Owensby’s death and the death of Nathaniel Jones, who died in 2003 while handcuffed, after attacking officers. The department has banned restraining techniques like choke holds – except in situations where an officer's life is in danger – and more officers began using Tasers. The city’s Collaborative Agreement followed, which encouraged police to use problem-solving strategies like engaging with the community. It recently underwent a major review and work to update it is ongoing. In Cincinnati, 'good policing' today Minneapolis could learn a few things from Cincinnati, local leaders and experts told The Enquirer. Scott Greenwood, a police oversight attorney who helped draw up the Colloborative Agreement, said watching the Floyd video takes him back to troubled times in Cincinnati. ""This reminded me so much of the Owensby case and (Jones') death,"" Greenwood said. He said most major city police departments consider choke holds and neck restraints deadly force equivalents and are either banned outright or only are allowed in situations where an officer would use their gun. As a result of the deaths of Jones and Owensby, Cincinnati police ""retrained everybody and highly regulated any sort of use of positional restraints,"" Greenwood said. ""They just don’t do it."" Cincinnati Vice Mayor Christopher Smitherman, chairman of the Law and Public Safety Committee, said talking about what's happening in Minneapolis is ""like talking about where we used to be. That was 17 years ago. That is not where this police department is today."" State Rep. Cecil Thomas was Downtown during the protests Friday night, where bottles and rocks were thrown at police officers. Thomas, a former police officer, was heartened by the restraint shown by police. ""That wasn't happening in 2001,"" he said. ""There's good direction coming from the top. Officers are using good policing."" After a second night of protests Saturday that saw a police officer shot, but saved by his helmet from injury, Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac said the department ""has come a long way."" ""We’ve done a tremendous amount of reform,"" Isaac said. ""We recognize there’s more to be done by our department; by our profession. We learned lessons from what happened in 2001. Today we do training on implicit bias, on fair and impartial policing. We’re continuing to look for things. We want to continue to stay on the front end."" Charlie Luken, who was the city's mayor during the 2001 riots, said the response by police to the weekend's protests ""was one of the most professional demonstrations of police work, ever."" ""All of our community was able to watch the teamwork, training and sensitivity of our police. Almost 20 years of work,"" he said. ""Worth every courtroom, meeting – every argument."" The 'asphyxiation' of Roger Owensby Jr. Owensby died Nov. 7, 2000 after officers pinned him, face down, on the pavement outside a convenience store in Roselawn. The coroner determined Owensby’s death resulted from “asphyxiation during restraint attempts.” Former Cincinnati police officer Robert Blaine Jorg stood trial on an involuntary manslaughter charge, but the jury deadlocked, and prosecutors decided not to pursue a second trial. Officer Patrick Caton was charged with misdemeanor assault, but at a trial, a jury found him not guilty. Caton remains with the department. According to deposition testimony in a lawsuit that led to a $6.5 million settlement, the largest ever for the city: Owensby may have been targeted by the officers. Essie Owensby, grandmother of Roger Owensby, Jr. (foreground photograph), reacts to the indictment of two Cincinnati police officers in her grandson's death while in police custody. (Photo: Enquirer file) The evening of Nov. 7, Officer Alexander Hasse and another officer were at a Seymour Avenue shopping plaza, arresting someone on a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge. Hasse said they broadcast a request for a ticket book so they could issue a citation. Jorg and another officer, Patrick Caton, responded in one vehicle. Officer David Hunter responded in another. They said they happened to notice Owensby, a man who had run from Hunter several weeks before. It was dark, and court documents say Owensby would have been about 50 yards away. Caton and Hunter began walking to the store and Jorg retrieved his baton from his cruiser. Owensby went into the store, bought an energy drink and two cigars. As he walked out of the store, Jorg confronted him. Owensby was an Army veteran who had served during the Persian Gulf war. His criminal record involved a few arrests for misdemeanor drug crimes and a misdemeanor assault, records show. He ultimately was taken face down in the parking lot, and a struggle ensued as the officers tried to handcuff Owensby, whose arms and hands were under his body. Caton straddled Owensby’s thighs and buttocks. Jorg placed Owensby in a “head wrap” – lying across Owensby’s shoulders and placing his left arm around Owensby’s head. Cincinnati Police Officer David Hunter demonstrates how he saw fellow police officer Patrick Caton straddle a handcuffed Roger Owensby Jr. and repeatedly punch him while he was on the ground, during the 2001 trial of Officer Robert Jorg. (Photo: Enquirer file) Jorg also placed a knee near Owensby’s left shoulder. At 7:48 p.m., Caton put out an “officer needs assistance” call, and several other officers responded. One, Darren Sellers, said at his deposition that it was impossible to know whether the difficulty officers were having getting Owensby’s arms out was a result of resistance or the combined weight of the officers and Owensby. After the handcuffs were on, Caton allegedly said, “Mace this motherf-----.” “Hunter instructed Jorg to lift Owensby’s head so that he could mace him directly in the face,” a federal judge, Arthur Spiegel, wrote in a 2004 order that allowed the lawsuit to proceed. Jorg then lifted Owensby’s head, turned his own head away “and drove his knees into Owensby’s back.” Spiegel wrote. Five officers picked up Owensby, whose face was cut and bleeding, and put him in the back of a police cruiser. There was a dispute about whether he was unconscious. Spiegel said none of the officers tried to provide Owensby with medical care. Officer Brian Brazile, who arrived after the struggle, used his flashlight to see Owensby in the backseat of the cruiser. “This looks f---ed up. Can he breathe?” Brazile said. “It don’t look like he can from the way he’s laying.” In response, two officers “shrugged their shoulders in indifference,” Spiegel wrote. Brazile walked away. A total of 13 officers responded to the scene, documents say. A sergeant finally asked an officer to roll down the cruiser’s window so he could check on Owensby. The sergeant reached in to check for a pulse and realized he wasn’t breathing. Owensby was pronounced dead at 8:47 p.m. Another 'positional asphyxiation' Three years later, in November 2003, Nathaniel Jones died while handcuffed. But his death had many contributing factors besides being unable to breath while face down on the ground. Jones had PCP and cocaine in his system when he attacked officers in front of the White Castle on West Mitchell Avenue. It took six officers, using three sets of handcuffs, to restrain him.

(Photo: AP Photo/Released by the Cincinnati Police via WCPO-TV) The county coroner attributed Jones’ death to heart problems related to a violent struggle and positional asphyxia. The officers were cleared of wrongdoing. In 2004, after Jones' family filed a federal lawsuit, two of the officers sued Jones’ estate in Hamilton County. They were awarded $13,000 each for injuries they suffered while arresting him. The department's use of body restraint tactics changed after Jones' death, said Cincinnati Fraternal Order of Police President Dan Hils. There was an understanding that they were not effective. ""We got trained on positional asphyxiation because of it,"" Hils said. The Cincinnati Police Department's use of force policy classifies choke holds as a form of deadly force. Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac reminded his officers Friday: ""Any type of choke hold is not appropriate or necessary."" 'There are some good ones out there' Owensby,'s father, Roger Owensby Sr., follows the news. Every time there is a death of a black man in police custody he reaches out to the family to offer his support. “Over the last 20 years, I have contacted 63 different families this has happened to,” he said. Each death-in-custody makes Owensby Sr. think of his son. He thinks about the time they served in the U.S. Army together, both stationed in Bosnia. He thinks about the times they would go fishing. He thinks about family outings. Owensby Jr. had a daughter at the time he died. She was 9. Roger Owensby, Sr. and his wife, Brenda, listen to the clerk read the verdict in the 2001 trial of Cincinnati police Officer Robert Jorg. (Photo: Enquirer file) Owensby took his wife, younger son, and Owensby's daughter away to North Carolina to get away from everything. They come back to visit Owensby Jr.'s grave in Crown Hill Memorial Park. One of those times was in 2009. The family was driving on Reading Road when they were pulled over by a Cincinnati police officer. When the officer came up to the car he asked, “Are you the Roger Owensby,” Owensby Sr. recalled. “I said yes. This is a white officer. He apologized for what happened. He said when he was in the academy they used my son’s death as the training. A tear came out of his eye.

My fellow Americans, my first and highest duty as president, is to defend our great country and the American people. I sworn oath to uphold the laws of our nation, and that is exactly what I will do. All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that for George and his family justice will be served. He will not have died in vain, but we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protesters to be drown out by an angry mob. The biggest victims off the rioting are peace loving citizens in our poorest communities. And is there President? I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you. I am your president of Law and Order and an ally of all peaceful protesters. But in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, riders, antifa and others. A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents. Innocent people have been savagely beaten, like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street or the woman in upstate New York viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed. New York's finest have been hit in the face with bricks. Brave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct has been overrun. Here in the nation's capital, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War Two Memorial has been vandalized. One of our most historic churches was set ablaze. A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero, was shot and killed. These air not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against God. America needs creation, not destruction. Cooperation, not contempt. Security, not anarchy. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos. This is our mission, and we will succeed 100%. We will succeed. Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America. I am mobilizing all available Federal resource is civilian and military to stop the rioting and looting to end the destruction and arson and to protect the rights of law abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights. Therefore, the following measures air going into effect immediately. First, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now. Today. I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard insufficient numbers that we dominate the streets. Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington, D. C. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement offices to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property. We're putting everybody on warning are seven oclock curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I want the organizer's of this terror to be unnoticed, that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail. This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence. One law and order and that is what it is. One law. We have one beautiful law and once that is restored and fully restored, we will help you. We will help your business and we will help your family. America is founded upon the rule of law. It is the foundation of our prosperity, our freedom and our very way of life. But where there is no law, there is no opportunity where there is no justice, there is no liberty. Where there is no safety, there is no future. We must never given to anger or hatred. If malice or violence reigns that none of us is free. I take these actions today with firm resolve and with a true and passionate love for our country. By far our greatest days. Lie ahead. Thank you very much. And now I'm going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. Thank you very much. Advertisement GOP senators critical of President Trump's response to unrest following Floyd's death Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: President Trump vows to deploy U.S. military if states can't control violent protestsTop GOP senators are calling on President Donald Trump to take a far more compassionate approach amid the deep unrest following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, raising concerns that the president's handling of the crisis so far threatens to divide a badly bruised nation further.""I think the country is definitely looking for healing and for calm, and I think that's the tone the president needs to project when talking about what is happening around the country,"" Senate Majority Whip John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, told CNN. ""I think he needs to strike a tone that fits the level of frustration country's experiencing right now, and I hope in the future, he'll do that.""Thune added that Trump's tweets about the situation have been ""not helpful.""Sen. John Cornyn, also a member of Senate GOP leadership, told CNN that ""I think it's important"" for Trump to offer more of a unifying message in the midst of the deep unrest across the county.""I presume at some point he will address the nation,"" said Cornyn of Texas. ""If I were advising him I would say we need it sooner rather than later.""At a time when Trump could be consoling the nation, Republicans — who rarely break from Trump — are voicing their disapproval that the president has offered little in the way of condolences and instead taken to Twitter to incite divisions and cast blame.""Some of his tweets have not been helpful,"" Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said at a news conference Monday. ""It would be helpful if he would change the tone of his message.""The message from his own party comes as protests have grown and spread throughout the country from Los Angeles to Washington.""We are obviously in a divisive situation right now that is escalating. ... He needs to make more unifying comments,"" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia.Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, speaking on the Senate floor, called on Trump ""to help heal the racial division.""""The president should help to heal the racial divisions in this country,"" Collins said. ""It is at times like this that a president needs to speak to the nation, to pledge to right wrongs and to calm inflamed passions.""Asked later if she thinks the president needs to offer a unifying message, Collins said: ""I do.""Sen. Cory Gardner, who like Collins is facing reelection next year, didn't criticize Trump directly but added: ""We all have to do better every day — we have to.""On Friday, the president's handling of the situation came under more scrutiny after he tweeted, ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" a phrase that originated from controversial Miami police chief Walter Headley at the height of the civil rights movement. Headley, who defended practices like using police dogs and force, said at news conference ""We don't mind being accused of police brutality,"" according to an article from the period in The New York Times.""Those are not constructive tweets without any question,"" Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate, told Fox on Sunday. ""I will say this, I spoke with the president (Saturday) morning, and he and I had a good conversation about the next steps. I told him, what I am going to tell you. I told him 'Mr. President, it helps us when you focus on the death, the unjustified in my opinion, the criminal death of George Floyd.'""On Monday during a private call with governors, the president continued to blast others for what has unfolded, accusing some states of being weak and arguing that law enforcement needed to ""dominate"" protestors in order to contain the demonstrations in cities across the country.""You have to dominate or you'll look like a bunch of jerks, you have to arrest and try people,"" the president told the governors in a call from the basement White House Situation Room, according to an audio recording of the call obtained by CNN.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn't answer questions Monday about whether he believed Trump had struck the appropriate tone in his handling of the unrest. Others also declined to comment about Trump's tweets, including Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, who faces voters in the fall.""Well, obviously this is an evolving situation — I think this is a difficult position the president is in,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida when asked if Trump should shift his tone to emphasize unity. On Monday, McConnell demonstrated a starkly different tone from the president from the floor of the Senate.""In no world, whatsoever, should arresting a man for an alleged minor infraction involve a police officer putting his knee on a man's neck for nine minutes while he cries out 'I can't breathe' and then goes silent,"" McConnell said. ""To me, to a great many of my fellow Kentuckians and to many outraged Americans, these disturbing events do not look like three isolated incidents, they look more like the latest chapter in our national struggle to make equal justice and equal protection of the law into facts of life for all Americans.""",0.0

Across the country, protesters are expressing outrage after the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. Cincinnati Enquirer Several people who were arrested during Sunday night's police round-up said they were met with aggression from officers and were not read their Miranda rights before being hauled off to the Hamilton County Justice Center. Angela Beamon, 37, said her group was peaceful when they came upon a wall of officers on Court Street in downtown Cincinnati. She told officers they would comply with Mayor John Cranley's 9 p.m. curfew order Sunday and attempted to retreat from the area. Before they could go anywhere, they were arrested. [Support local journalism: Subscribe now for unlimited access to Cincinnati.com] ""The officers began to advance (on) the group,"" Beamon told the Enquirer on Monday outside Courtroom A. ""We did not advance (on) them. Herding us in here like cattle is not the solution to the problem."" Over two hundred people were arrested over the weekend on a variety of charges stemming from the protests in downtown Cincinnati and the Clifton area. Most were for curfew violations. The protests were sparked after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis over Memorial Day Weekend. (Photo: Liz Dufour/The Enquirer) Cincinnati Police spokesman Lt. Steve Saunders said there were 307 arrests related to the protest and curfew violations on Sunday. More than 100 people, including Beamon, waited their turn Monday morning to see Municipal Court Judge Alan Triggs for their arraignment. Triggs cleared half the docket since many of the protesters had already bonded out. Individuals will have to come back at a later date for their hearing. More than half of the arrest paperwork available for Sunday was for arrests that occurred in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood. Charges include misconduct at an emergency, which is the curfew violation, failure to disperse, disorderly conduct, and obstruction of official business. Beamon said the goal of the protest was to address social and racial injustices, not destroy property or harm police. ""We're not all out here trying to tear things down,"" she said. ""This is our city. We don't want our city in flames, but we also don't want our brothers and sisters to die either. We're fighting fights that our grandparents and our great grandparents fought. We're doing it so our kids and their kids won't have to."" Angela Beamon, of Bond Hill, talks about being arrested Sunday night for a curfew violation. Beamon said she was one of the leaders of the protests that were sparked after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis over Memorial Day Weekend (Photo: Liz Dufour/The Enquirer) David Daugherty, the spokesman for the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office, said about 100 of the people arrested Sunday night were held overnight in a sally port at the Justice Center, which is enclosed on all sides but open on top. What happened Sunday North Avondale resident Michelle Rice, 28, said she and her friend ran from rubber bullets and tear gas on Sunday night. She said multiple officers were telling them different things to do. ""They unloaded on us without warning,"" Rice said. ""As we were running away from the (rubber) bullets, we realized police had completely boxed us in on all sides. There was nowhere to go. They created chaos and weren't even on the same page as far as managing the chaos. They didn't even read us our Miranda rights."" Saunders said officers don't typically read Miranda Rights for curfew violations or when gathering basic information. Officers usually read people their rights if they're asking questions pertaining to an investigation, he said. Shawntina Huntley, of Carthage, gets choked up talking about the ordeal of being arrested for breaking curfew Sunday night during the protests. Protests across the country were sparked after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis over Memorial Day Weekend. The police officer has been charged in the case. She talked after her court appearance in the Justice Center Monday, June 1, 2020. (Photo: Liz Dufour/The Enquirer) Shawntina Huntley, 29, from Carthage, said she was arrested on Saturday on Vine and Liberty streets. She said police treated the group like animals during the arrest, fired beanbags at the crowd, and closed in on the group near Alabama Fishbar. She said they were not read their Miranda rights. ""A lot of young people were arrested that didn't even have records,"" Huntley said at the Justice Center on Monday. ""People are getting fired because of this. The crowd I was in was peaceful and not destroying anything. I thought my city was better than this."" One of those arrested said he was not protesting but simply leaving a friend's house in OTR and got caught up in the arrest. Terrance Brown, 34, said police arrested him, brought him to the jail, and recited his rights before letting him go. He did not get booked. ""I was coming outside and I didn't know what was going on,"" Brown explained. ""I was about to get in my car when they stopped me for a curfew violation. I wasn't protesting or anything.""

Roat said he was about to walk to his car when police approached him. ""An officer approached me and put me in handcuffs before I was able to run away,"" he said. ""I feel a little bit sore for being in handcuffs for more than three hours before they took them off."" Saunders said he couldn't speak directly to the incidents described in the article, but said all officers were encouraged to advise and warn people that they were violating the curfew and could be subject to arrest if they did not leave.

Protesters lingered in the Lafayette Square area well past the 7 p.m. citywide curfew. Several of the demonstrators were seen being taken into custody, waiting for further processing. By 9 p.m., there were reports of arrests happening throughout the city as some protesters started working their way back to the White House. The arrests and military show of force occurred in the hours after law enforcement officers used shields and tear gas to clear protesters from a park across the street from the White House as Trump prepared to make comments in the Rose Garden. His address came as hundreds of protesters surrounded the White House grounds for the fourth day of protests in Washington. The Department of Justice later issued a statement saying Trump directed Attorney General Wiliam Barr ""assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia."" The statement went on to say that several federal agencies, including the FBI, ATF and DEA, were coordinating to ""maximize federal security presence"" in DC. Monday's demonstrations marked a week after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis set off protests and riots in that city and dozens of others across the nation. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged in Floyd's death. More:George Floyd protests: How did we get here? At about 6:30 p.m., law enforcement officers cleared Lafayette Park with tear gas, rubber bullets, shields and horses. Trump had yet to appear for his comments as the protesters, who at the time were peaceful, were being pushed back. At 6:44 p.m., Trump began his comments by pledging to be a ""law and order"" president as officers continued to push protesters blocks away from where he was standing, using some form of projectile. Trump announced his plan to ""mobilize"" federal resources to ""stop the rioting and looting."" He said the goal was to ""dominate the streets."" As Trump promised to stop the protests and specifically said the D.C. protests would be controlled, protesters nearby continued to be pushed back as law enforcement officials cleared the way for Trump to visit the nearby St. John's Church, where he stood holding a bible. Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU's National Security Project, said Trump's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act and dispatch the military to America's streets would be ""irresponsible and dangerous."" ""No level-headed governor is asking for an even more militarized response to civilian protests against police brutality and systemic racism — for good reason. There are already many reports of civilian police and some state National Guard forces engaging in serious abuses, and the deployment of military personnel, who are generally not trained for civilian law enforcement, only escalates the risks. This president must not cause the country and its people even more harm."" Monday's protests came after a weekend of rioting in the nation’s capital left deep scars in the shadow of the White House and across the city, where 88 people were arrested and dozens of law enforcement officers, including Secret Service agents, were injured. The smoldering aftermath resembled ugly scenes in cities across the country following Floyd's death. Sunrise yielded smashed storefronts, heaps of shattered glass and iconic national monuments stained by graffiti. George Floyd protest live updates:Prison riot teams deployed to DC; in Minneapolis, 'chaos is the soundtrack of the city' D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a curfew Monday beginning at 7 p.m. and continuing for two days. Protesters returned that afternoon to the White House to chant against both Trump and police brutality. Some were handing out water and others were selling masks that read ""I can't breathe,"" a reference to what Floyd was telling the arresting officers as he was dying. Lafayette Park, a primary protesting site through the weekend, was closed off Monday. Still, several hundreds of protesters gathered in the area to chant ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Don't shoot"" while facing officers guarding the park. Monday marks the fourth day that the White House has been the focal point of the protesters, prompting an increased response from law enforcement agencies. In response, Barr deployed federal riot teams to D.C. Riot teams are being sent from the federal Bureau of Prisons, while the FBI also has directed its elite Hostage Rescue Unit to help, a senior Justice Department official said Monday. More:George Floyd died from 'asphyxiation from sustained pressure,' family autopsy finds To safeguard the White House complex, the Secret Service said it was working with both federal and local law enforcement agencies, including the National Guard, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, U.S. Park Police and Arlington County Police. ""The Secret Service respects the right to assemble,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Throughout these demonstrations, no individuals have crossed the White House fence line and no Secret Service protectees have been in danger."" Through Saturday and early Sunday, more than 60 Secret Service Uniformed Division Officers and special agents suffered multiple injuries from bricks, rocks, bottles, fireworks and other items hurled at them. ""Secret Service personnel were also directly physically assaulted as they were kicked, punched, and exposed to bodily fluids,"" the agency said. A total of 11 injured personnel were transported to a local hospital and treated for non-life threatening injuries. Contributing: Bart Jansen, Kristine Phillips.",0.0

For four days and nights, they have been shoving, gassing, corralling and arresting people who are protesting the police brutality against Black people that led to the shooting death of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor in her home in March. Someone marching on the streets was going to get shot. Instead, it was a man who sells barbecue. On Monday morning, police and soldiers showed up at 26th Street and Broadway to disperse a group of people who not protesting but rather were hanging out, listening to music and eating food as they did routinely there. Their crime: They were out after curfew. Police say someone fired a shot at them, so, of course, the right thing to do was for officers and soldiers to shoot toward a crowd. When the shooting ended, David McAtee, a well-known and liked West End purveyor of barbecue Yaya’s BBQ was found dead. And on Tuesday, police released a video that they say shows McAtee firing a gun before he was struck and killed. The officers’ body cameras were not on, conveniently for them. The police chief (before the mayor fired him Monday) initially implied that law enforcement had killed McAtee, but later authorities clarified that they were still investigating. In February, McAtee had told West of Ninth documentarians that he chose that spot on Broadway because it “is one of the busiest locations in West Louisville.” He said he focuses on his cooking: “I have always been blessed with the skills to cook. I didn’t need anything else. People have to eat every single day, and all I need is my skills.” Reportedly, he would give meals to officers. Meanwhile, in Lexington, protesters marched Sunday for the third night in a row, bring out the largest crowd yet, standing face-to-face with a line of police, The Lexington Herald-Leader reported. And what did Lexington police do? “The protesters chanted for police to kneel with them. After a number of officers kneeled, protesters moved forward to embrace them. Several protesters thanked the officers or fist-bumped them,” the paper wrote. The Lexington protest began to break up by 10:45 p.m. Some protesters stayed and chanted at police past midnight. “But a group of protesters also prayed with Lexington officers. As of 1 a.m., Lexington police said they had made no arrests in relation to the protest.” Two cities. Two outcomes. Advertisement Louisville and Lexington are not the same in many ways. How police conduct themselves should not be one of them. What is so ingrained in the Louisville Metro Police Department that it felt it could use overwhelming force to beat back protest against overwhelming force by police. Don’t they see the irony? They cannot abide by even their own rules. Since the first protest last Thursday, the police and Mayor Greg Fischer have urged protesters to express themselves peacefully. Fischer thanked them for protesting peacefully. Police Lt. Col. Lavita Chavous tried to sound empathetic. “Our goal will be to allow for the peaceful expression of protest. We value the right to free speech and understand this community has a lot to say right now. We hear you. We will not tolerate violence that leads to people being hurt. We will not tolerate destruction of our beautiful city. We are prepared to take whatever action we must to try to ensure no one else is injured during this time of unrest,” she said. Yet, before the dusk-to-dawn curfew was set to take place Sunday, police were deploying tear gas. When asked about this, Chavous said this action was taken so early because the protest was an “unlawful assembly” for lack of permits. “We have allowed the no-street access simply to be accommodating to people and allow them to voice their opinions and views in a positive and peaceful way,” she said. “But I want you to know that LMPD could have legally taken those steps a lot earlier than we did. And it wasn’t until we became concerned for the safety of the community and the safety of our officers that we declared it to be an unlawful gathering.” She talked about leaf blowers used to blow back tear gas. Problem solved: Don’t throw tear gas! Metro Council member Bill Hollander questioned Chavous’ comments. “We can’t tell people to protest peacefully and, after the fact, say we can gas you anytime if you don’t have a permit,” Hollander tweeted. “The public deserves an investigation and report from an independent oversight system it can trust.” That is all fine. But what Louisvillians really deserve are leaders who would not allow the police to overreact and would not allow armed weekend soldiers march on civilians (think: Kent State).

1622855381,2020-06-01 19:24:05,From peaceful protest to tragedy: Notes from Sunday in Louisville,https://www.leoweekly.com/2020/06/peaceful-protest-tragedy-notes-sunday-louisville/,en,False,,114483,leoweekly.com,http://leoweekly.com/,"Forty minutes before the 9 p.m. curfew Sunday, police dispensed tear gas, dispersing a crowd of hundreds in Jefferson Square Park downtown. Early Monday morning, the LMPD and the National Guard moved in to clear a group of people from a parking lot at 26th Street and Broadway, more than 20 blocks from where the protests initially occurred. They claim someone fired a shot, so they returned fire. David McAtee, owner of Yaya’s BBQ Shack, was killed — someone known for commonly giving local police free food. On Tuesday, police released a video from surveillance cameras that they say showed McAtee firing a gun outside of his business, but the footage is unclear, as it partially loses sight of him as he exits his restaurant. Police had their body cameras turned off, so an angle from the officers isn’t available. Earlier, Sunday didn’t seem like it was spiraling toward tragedy, as the fourth day of protest was tense but largely peaceful, with waves of people downtown who seemed local, nonaggressive and focused only on protesting Breonna Taylor’s death and other instances of police violence. Firing tear gas at a calm crowd or letting the military loose in the West End in no way seems like a reasonable reaction to what we witnessed yesterday. And now a beloved member of the community is dead. LEO followed the protesters for several hours. Here is an approximated timeline of what we experienced. 3:30 p.m. — Black Lives Matter Louisville held a healing ceremony in front of the KFC Yum Center. Speakers included Democratic state Rep. Charles Booker, who is also running to unseat Sen. Mitch McConnell; ACLU organizer Keturah Herron; and Jecorey Arthur, who is running for Metro Council District 4. “We want peace,” Booker said. “We’re standing because we deserve peace. This is about our humanity. No matter how the sun has kissed your skin, you know if someone hurts your Black brother or sister, it hurts you too.” Booker went on talk about how structural racism has endangered people of color. “You may be seen as a deadly weapon, before being seen as a human being,” he said. “It ain’t right. And it’s hurting all of us.” After the speakers finished, the vast majority of the crowd left, many of them walking East toward cars parked in the Nulu area. 4 p.m. — We walked through Fourth Street Live. Every window was boarded up with the exception of those at the Fifth Third Bank, which I assume invests in the strongest windows money can buy. Only a few other people were there checking out the damage, most of which was cleaned up. It was almost silent, extremely strange and felt walking through a ghost town. 4:30 p.m. — Two groups formed at Jefferson Square Park. One appeared to be a church group and was holding a small service. The other group was organizing a march. Shortly thereafter, about 100 to 200 people marched east down Jefferson Street, with the LMPD and the National Guard following behind. The group took a left on Second Street and another left on Main Street. Most of the group stuck together and kept moving, but about 20 people turned to face the police. Each time the police got near them, the protesters eventually moved back. A member of the police department was on a bullhorn, calling the situation an unlawful gathering and saying that if people didn’t disperse, they would release chemical agents. By the time the police reached Sixth Street, most of the crowd had already had continued to the Muhammad Ali Center. A small group stayed at Sixth and Main streets, but at that point there were more members of the police and the National Guard then there were protesters. It eventually deescalated. Advertisement 5:30 p.m. — Speeches were delivered in the amphitheater outside of the Muhammad Ali Center. People sat calmly, cheered and handed out water to each other. The police didn’t follow them, instead moving back to Jefferson Square Park. The tension evaporated. Moments like this tend to understandably get buried or untold, because there are more critical and tragic elements to report and discuss, but this was a powerful part of the day from a gentle group of people, who were clearly there to pursue justice, not to create any sort of violence. 7 p.m. — Back at Jefferson Square, there were only a few protesters, but the park was covered in police officers and National Guard members. 7:30 p.m. — A large group of protesters marched down Liberty Street, stopping at the park. They formed a few lines, one facing the police and one that went across Liberty, facing East. The crowd mostly just chanted, remaining peaceful. A police drone hovered above the crowd. 8 p.m. — A few members of the crowd told people to consider going home, especially if they were with children, and a couple hundred people left, walking down Sixth toward Broadway. The people who stayed remained collected. I walked through the entire crowd and there didn’t seem to be groups of people trying to ignite any sort of violence. Most people appeared to be with a significant other or a small group of friends. If anything, for at least a moment, it seemed to be possibly winding down. 8:20 p.m. — Tear gas was released. When asked why the police released tear gas before the curfew, police Col. LaVita Chavous, assistant chief of the police, said at a 10:45 p.m. media briefing that it had turned into an “unlawful gathering” because protesters were blocking the road and didn’t have a permit. She said protesters had leaf blowers and umbrellas, which she said can be used to “blow back chemicals into the police face.” Many questioned the decision, including Louisville Metro Council member Bill Hollander.",0.0

[Editor’s Note: On Tuesday, The Louisville Metropolitan Police Department released footage that they said showed David McAtee firing first at police and the National Guard before being shot. You can watch the video here. Based on the footage, LEO cannot confirm if McAtee fired and, if he did, whether he fired first.] Why were Louisville police and the National Guard in The West End after midnight on Monday when the protests that evening had occurred mostly downtown? Why, 11 hours later, was David McAtee’s body still where he was found dead, after police and the Guard fired in his direction? And, the question that is behind the protests and why police and Guard were on the streets: Why are Black people constantly losing their lives during encounters with law enforcement? These are the questions that the crowd at 26th Street and Broadway was asking as they gathered at 11:30 a.m. Monday to talk about and mourn McAtee’s death. McAtee had owned a barbecue business at the intersection. “I have no information on what took place, but I do know that a trained professional fired rounds toward an unarmed Black man. At the end of the day, there’s a Black man dead and a trained professional living,” said Jerron Thomas, a Kentucky State University student and West Louisville resident. “I’m down here because that could have been me.” Several hours after the gathering, Mayor Greg Fischer fired police Chief Steve Conrad, who was under withering criticism in the Breonna Taylor case and had agreed to retire by June 30. Fischer said the officers at 26th Street and Broadway had not used their body cameras, a violation that demanded Conrad’s firing, calling it “an especially grievous error at a time of such heightened focus on police activities.” At a press conference, Conrad’s replacement, interim Police Chief Rob Schroeder, said he did not know yet who shot McAtee, but two National Guard members and two Louisville police officers fired their weapons in the incident that ended in McAtee’s death. They were returning fire after an unidentified suspect or suspects shot at them, according to Schroeder. “At this point in the investigation after last night’s events, we do not know actually who shot him,” Schroeder said. “We do not know if it was related to a separate incident, if it was due to the shots by our officers and the National Guardsman and soldiers that accompanied them.” The police and the National Guard were called to 26th Street and Broadway to disperse a crowd at the nearby Dino’s Food Mart, which had gathered after curfew. Several community members at Monday morning’s gathering said that people often hang out at Dino’s, so this late-Sunday night crowd was not unusual. Advertisement As the public calls for Fischer to leave office, too, he attended the gathering and spoke with McAtee’s mother, expressing at the press conference “deep sorrow” at McAtee’s death and vowing to “get to the truth” of what happened. “We had a horrible tragedy last night at 26th and Broadway,” he said. “We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee. David was a friend to many, well known, a barbecue man that nurtured so many people in their bellies, in their hearts. And for him to be caught up in this and for him to not be with us today is a tragedy.” Several people at 26th Street and Broadway Monday said that McAtee was a familiar sight to many in the community. “I come here a lot, and I eat food. And he was a nice gentleman, never threatening, aggressive, anything,” said Joshua Smith. “Like, he sold food to the neighborhood. So, for him to get, wrong place, wrong time by the police, that’s like, why?” The crowd stood across the street from Dino’s, facing a line of police officers who were guarding the crime scene. They occasionally pushed out into the road but organizers with megaphones guided them back, saying, “Do not cross the shooting line.” The organizers paced in front of the crowd, preaching their grievances to a receptive audience. “They treat [n-word]s like dogs,” said one Black man in response. “No, they don’t,” replied one woman. “They treat dogs better than us.” Frank Smith, the president of the Interdenominational Ministerial Coalition, who stood at the front of the group, told LEO that he came to 26th Street and Broadway to learn more about what happened to McAtee. He was not surprised by the mood of the crowd he found there. “This is indicative of years of neglect, years of unjust acts, years of mistrust given that there have been people who have been shot by police, and they’ve been exonerated,” he said. “We just have to get this resolved and get the policies in place that let the civilians know that we are serious, and they are serious together with us about taking sure that we are treated in a equitable fashion.” Schroeder said the reason police left McAtee’s body where he was shot was because police needed to gather evidence. After the small group of officers swathed in riot gear left around 3 p.m., the crowd cheered.",0.0

It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke.Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. Biden also said he'd be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital"" and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month. “I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.”Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid March.His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.”Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice. “He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.”Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer.Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans' memorial near his Wilmington home, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd.In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke.“The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer.Biden's standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden's flailing primary campaign, but it's unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November. “I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,"" Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.”Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media. “To see the president of the United States say that he's going to send the military into our communities but hadn't mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Much of Biden's campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump's handling of moments of racial tension. In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in.Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now.“I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That's not who he is,"" said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”",0.0

First pastor, Of course. Thank you for joining us tonight. Earlier today you were pro testing in ST Mathews. It was peaceful there. Walk us through. What happened? Paint the picture of what happened to you. Absolutely. Well, we started protesting in ST Mathews because we understand that if we're going to see change and we're going to get the attention of the people that need to see it, we need to go outside of the areas that they're expecting. We got there, we were peacefully protest, and we were walk walking in the street. We were approached by the police department and I experienced what a lot of black people are experiencing today. Excessive force screaming in my face to resist arrest with stop resisting, which I was not doing. And then I was told that you're a big guy. What's happening and I think this is happening everywhere is that the police departments are police scene, uh, not behavior, but they're policing color, and they're but they're policing out of fear. And I think this has to stop because we continue to see these instances. We're seeing this picture now of what happened. There's video on the Internet on social media. Tell us again. You said you were pro testing. What exactly were you doing in that moment when things escalated to this situation? Well, he gave me a particular instruction. I disregarded the instruction. He wanted me to stand in a particular place. He then screamed out, Arrest him. They grabbed me on both arms immediately. When they grabbed me on both arms, they said to stop resisting. From that point forward, things escalated. And again, thinking about Briana Taylor thinking about Mr Makati were not given any sort of benefit of the doubt. And this will continue to happen, and we'll continue to show up in places that are not expected until there are structural and policy changes. What happened after this picture? Were you taken to jail where you cited? No, I had the benefit that many people don't have. I was in the back of the police car, and apparently they found out that I wasn't, um, just a regular citizen. And then I got apologies. They referred to me as Reverend Finley. Um, and the issue is there are many, many people in this city that don't have a name that don't have what I have and they don't get that benefit of the doubt. And I don't want this to be about me. I want this to be about Briana Taylor. I want this to be about amount are very. I want this to be about Mr Makati. What is your hope, pastor, for these protests? Because a lot of people don't understand why you're out there. What is your hope? Um, again, I want to see the way. The way that police department polices black people. I want to see that change. There is no reason to have a knee on my neck. There's no reason to have ah, high powered weapon on the back of my head. I'm obviously their protest ing. And I'm not looking for violence. They know that. But there is no reason for that. That is a knee jerk reaction that too many black people in Louisville and across the country deal with every single day. All right, Pastor, we do appreciate you taking time out of your night on coming by. We're glad that you're ok. Ah, hopefully it will continue tonight to be peaceful and we appreciate what you're doing. Thank you. SIGN UP FOR BREAKING NEWS Get local stories sent straight to your inbox as news breaks.

More than a thousand protesters gathered at Jefferson Square Park to demonstrate in the wake of the deaths of Breonna Taylor, who was killed by Louisville Metro Police in March, and David McAtee, who died at the hands of LMPD and the National Guard early Monday morning. Maybe thousands walking down sixth toward broadway near federal court pic.twitter.com/bpZ8PQQMQO — Ryan Van Velzer (@RyanVanVelzer) June 1, 2020 Protesters knelt in a moment of solidarity before marching down Sixth Street to Broadway, where they turned west and headed for Yaya’s BBQ, the site where he was gunned down by authorities less than 24 hours earlier. Cynthia Ganote, a white woman, says she was marching to show solidarity with people of color. She said she feels her place is to show up, listen and act. “It is not up to those who are constantly being oppressed to figure out how to end systemic oppression,” Ganote said. Verona Hardimon, a Black woman whose family lives in the West End, says she heard the commotion and decided to see the protests for herself, with her granddaughter and her son. She commented on the many white faces joining in the march. “I think that’s what it’s going to take — white people standing up for what’s wrong and how we’ve been treated for years. I really do, I love it,” Hardimon said. Once the march reached the site where McAtee died, most demonstrators turned around and walked back toward downtown. There were already hundreds more gathered there. After the march, a few hundred of the protesters returned to downtown. Up until this point, the police presence had been much less noticeable than in recent days. But around 10 p.m., things changed. Mayor Greg Fischer said police broke up the protest because shots were fired. WFPL’s Ryan Van Velzer did not hear gunshots, but that doesn’t mean they didn’t happen. It was a chaotic scene. Police began firing teargas, flash bangs and pepper balls. Police are now firing on pepper balls smoke and teargas. They did warn protesters that they would be arrested if they stayed pic.twitter.com/yBckzopsZB — Ryan Van Velzer (@RyanVanVelzer) June 2, 2020  Two police lines formed and marched on protesters, at one point firing tear gas behind them, forcing them to run through it. Officers also appeared on rooftops and fired non-lethal deterrents down on small clusters of protesters after clearing Jefferson Square Park. Here’s what one protester, Christina, saw: “When we got here there were people running down the streets crying because they got shot with teargas, one girl was running down the street screaming I can’t see, I can’t see, I can’t see.” Within a half hour, police seem to have retaken downtown. Twenty blocks west — police were nowhere to be seen for much of the evening. Shortly after 8 p.m., more than a thousand people were crowded at the intersection of 26th and Broadway. They carried signs and honked horns, they embraced and shared tales of McAtee. The night was less protest and more celebration of sorts for McAtee — known around here as Yaya. “Ain’t nobody else can barbecue better than him, no chef can tear up in the kitchen better than him. None of that, this block isn’t going to be nothing without Yaya, they done destroyed a legend, for nothing,” said a young man who goes by Snow. Snow spent lots of time in McAtee’s shop — and like many other here had never ending stories about McAtee’s generosity, his presence and the gaping hole his death leaves. “No lie, there is no 26 without YaYa,” he said. McAtee was known for his barbecue. He owned a small restaurant here at this intersection and fed passersby, police and anyone who needed a bite to eat — he would leave meat on the grill at night for homeless, he’d happily hand over a hotdog even if you were short on cash. He was killed in a barrage of bullets fired by police and the National Guard. Jacob Ryan His brother, Marvin McAtee, said when the police and soldiers arrived they began firing non-lethal pepper balls, and Yaya was reaching out the door of the shop to grab a cousin and pull him inside when he caught a bullet in his chest — a real bullet. “It’s the most terrible loss I’ve ever had in my life, and I’ve had losses. He was my mentor, my rock, didn’t nobody ride for me in my family like he did. It’s a terrible loss,” he said. Marvin is co-owner of the barbecue shop and says he plans to honor his brother’s legacy — cooking food and playing music. “Old school music, their young music, all the way the people like. He’s a good man, he’s a good man,” Marvin said. Jake C As the night wore on and the imposed curfew of 9 p.m. came and went, no police had shown up — but people wondered constantly if they would. And if they did… what would happen. The night was incredibly peaceful — but just before 11 p.m., a fire broke out atop Dino’s Food Mart, a convenience store right at the intersection. Firefighters showed up; police and the National Guard were right behind them. For less than an hour, the police and soldiers monitored the scene, some with rifles, some without.

David McAtee, known in the Russell neighborhood for his popular barbeque stand outside of Dino's Food Mart, was killed early Monday morning as Louisville Metro Police and National Guard were trying to break up a ""large crowd"" in the parking lot of the mart at West Broadway and 26th Street. He was 53. Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the shooting, which will be a joint effort between the FBI Louisville Field Office and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District, federal officials said. More: 5 takeaways from Beshear on fatal shootings of David McAtee, Breonna Taylor in Louisville Hours after the governor publicly asked Louisville officials to release a ""significant"" amount of body camera footage from the incident ""as soon as possible,"" the city announced there wasn't any. Two LMPD officers involved in the shooting either had failed to activate or were not wearing body cameras during the incident, Mayor Greg Fischer told the public Monday night. The mayor also said Monday he fired LMPD Chief Steven Conrad, who announced he would retire at the end of June amid mounting public pressure following the police killing of 26-year-old ER technician Breonna Taylor. ""This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,"" Fischer said. On Monday morning, Conrad told the public that at about 12:15 a.m., someone from the crowd in the Dino's parking lot area at 26th and Broadway shot at authorities. When the police and guardsmen returned fire, they struck McAtee. No one else was injured. 'My son didn't hurt nobody': David McAtee, Louisville business owner, killed by authorities Conrad said it wasn't clear that it was McAtee who fired at officers, but ""several persons of interest"" were being interviewed following the shooting. Surveillance footage and police radio transmissions released by LMPD Monday evening offered no clear-cut answers. However, ""dozens"" of officers were at the scene, according to the recordings. Several protesters and Russell residents there Monday afternoon questioned why so many officers and troops were present in the first place before the shooting. The most significant protest Sunday night was roughly 20 blocks away downtown. Officials haven't said whether the crowd was made up of protesters or customers, and some activists have questioned whether there was a protest there at all. They said they were trying to enforce the curfew and that the site had a history of violent incidents. Acting LMPD Chief Rob Schroeder said the department will review the incident to determine whether any other policy violations occurred, and there ""will be discipline"" for failing to use cameras. ""That is completely unacceptable,"" Schroeder said. ""And there is no excuse for their clear failure to (follow) our policy."" The two LMPD officers involved in the shooting are Katie Crews and Allen Austin, neither of whom have any disciplinary records, according to LMPD. Austin joined in 2016 and Crews in 2018. The names of the National Guard troops have not been released. McAtee's body was at the scene until at least Monday afternoon. A group of LMPD officers in face shields formed a line just behind the crime scene tape, facing neighbors and protesters who came out throughout the day. By evening, there was still a crowd. Several folks gathered across from Dino's said they knew McAtee or have eaten his barbeque. A group of about 100 people lined the sidewalk across the street from the LMPD line throughout the day. Some said they'd been at other protests this weekend, but many said they just lived in the neighborhood. Metro Councilwoman Barbara Sexton Smith said Kentucky State Police was at the scene Monday afternoon, and that their investigations typically take more time. A State Police spokesman hadn't returned a request for comment from The Courier Journal. On Monday afternoon, the Rev. Steve Frank, president of Louisville's Interdenominational Ministerial Coalition, could be seen speaking with McAtee's family across the street from where he was killed. ""(His) mother wants to see her son,"" Frank told The Courier Journal. Carlos ""Bossfam"" Nolen, who often holds promotional events at a bar across from Dino's, said he knew McAtee well. ""This is a strong loss. A lot more would have happened on this corner if he wasn't here,"" Nolen said. ""Time after time I've witnessed him stop the escalation of violence with food."" The shooting outside Dino's Food Mart came after a curfew had taken effect at 9 p.m. Sunday as protests and unrest over the death of Taylor continued. Fischer extended the 9 p.m. through 6:30 a.m. curfew through June 8. On Saturday, Beshear announced that he was sending roughly 350 Kentucky National Guard personnel to Louisville to ""ensure the safety of everybody"" and ""help keep peace."" Although protests in downtown Louisville have started out peaceful each evening, the scenes have turned more chaotic after sunset. Seven people were shot and wounded during Thursday night's protest. Looting, vandalism and damage to physical and private property exploded Friday night. Sunday night had the fewest protesters overall, police said. ""And now our mission is to work fast, to be thorough and to get full results so that this family can have full accountability and the truth,"" Beshear said.

Taylor, 26, was fatally shot while Louisville police officers were executing a no-knock search warrant at her southwest Louisville apartment as part of a narcotics investigation just before 1 a.m. on March 13. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said he did not hear officers announce themselves and fired a single shot. Taylor was killed in the return fire. Sgt.

Jefferson Commonwealth's Attorney Tom Wine announced last month that all charges against him were being dismissed. Also: Police officer left out key facts in obtaining indictment of Breonna Taylor's boyfriend The shooting has captured national attention along with other controversial shootings of African Americans across the country.

The upbraiding from the White House didn't sit well with many governors, who have been busy responding to clashes between protesters and law enforcement in dozens of U.S. cities sparked by the death a week ago of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Trump took a tough line with the governors, saying he was putting Attorney General William Barr in charge of the federal law enforcement response. The president said the White House was ""strongly looking for arrests."" ""You have to arrest people and you have to try people. And they have to go to jail for long periods of time,"" the president said. ""If people are running amok, you have to dominate. If you aren't dominating, you're wasting your time,"" he said. ""They're going to run over you; you're going to look like a bunch of jerks."" ""It's a movement. If you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse,"" Trump said. ""The only time it's successful is when you're weak and most of you are weak."" The call followed yet another night of unrest Sunday over the May 25 death of Floyd and came on the same day that the president in a Rose Garden address urged governors deploy National Guard troops to quell the unrest. ""If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. In the nation's capital, where U.S. Secret Service uniformed officers, military police and other law enforcement on Monday fired tear gas on peaceful protesters outside of the White House, Trump said he was already ""dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property."" While some governors, such as South Carolina's Henry McMaster, a Republican, praised Trump's calls for a crackdown, others took umbrage at the president's combative tone and questioned his authority to unilaterally deploy federal troops to the states. During the conference call, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, warned the president that the ""rhetoric coming out of the White House is making it worse,"" to which Trump snapped back, ""I don't like your rhetoric that much either."" ""I had to speak up, and I told him that his rhetoric is inflaming matters, that it's making things worse, and that we need to call for police reform,"" Pritzker told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""We need to call for calm, that that's what the president should do and we need national leadership in this regard."" ""He unfortunately — you know,"" the governor added, ""he reacted badly."" Pritzker also said that what Trump's suggesting is ""illegal."" ""The governor of a state has to ask for federal help. I don't know any governor that intends to do that,"" he said. ""And secondly, you know, you can hear in his rhetoric that he is simply trying to make himself sound like a strong man — almost like a dictator, as if he's going to be responsible for bringing order all the way."" In Michigan, where police and protesters have skirmished in Grand Rapids despite many demonstrations remaining peaceful, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, called the president's remarks ""dangerous"" and said they should be ""gravely concerning to all Americans."" The president's comments, she said, ""send a clear signal that this administration is determined to sow the seeds of hatred and division, which I fear will only lead to more violence and destruction."" ""We must reject this way of thinking. This is a moment that calls for empathy, humanity, and unity,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This is one of the most challenging periods in our nation's history, but as Americans, we must remember our enemy is racial injustice, not one another."" The Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, said he wasn't surprised by the president's ""incendiary words."" ""At so many times during these last several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it simply was nowhere to be found,"" he said following the phone call with Trump. ""Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest. That's not what we need in Boston, it's not what we need right now in Massachusetts,"" he said as his voice cracked with emotion, ""and it's definitely not what we need across this great country of ours either."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, called the president's remarks the ""rantings of an insecure man trying to look strong after building his entire political career on racism."" On the subject of the deploying of federal troops, Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN that he would respond to such an offer by saying, ""Thank you, but no thank you."" ""He wants to make this about looting because he doesn't want to talk about the killing of Mr. Floyd,"" Cuomo said. ""[He] doesn't want to really talk about racism and discrimination."" Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear was reportedly not on the call with the president. Beshear was instead talking with the mother of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American resident of Louisville who was killed in March by police executing a no-knock warrant. The president did praise one Democratic governor for his response to the unrest — Minnesota's Tim Walz, who fully mobilized National Guard troops on Saturday to supplement law enforcement. But at another point in the call, Trump called Minnesota ""a laughingstock all over the world."" Walz said Monday that he responded by saying: ""No one's laughing here. We're in pain. We're crying. We saw a man lose his life in front of them and our challenge is that this is about social trust, social compacts and reestablishing faith in the people who are there to serve them.""

But several states have primaries up and down the ballot: Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Washington, D.C. Pennsylvania is holding primary voting on Tuesday, though Gov. Tom Wolf extended the deadline for voting by mail by one week, until June 9. Here are the races to watch. Live results will appear Tuesday evening. Presidential primaries press on. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has not yet officially clinched the nomination. He is 425 delegates short of the magic number of 1,991. With 500 delegates at stake Tuesday, he needs 85% of the delegates up for grabs, which he's unlikely to get. More likely, Biden will cross the threshold next week, June 9, when Georgia and West Virginia vote, with their 133 delegates at stake (and when we'll get the results of Pennsylvania's primary, with its 186 delegates). Rep. Steve King on the ropes. The controversial Iowa conservative faces real danger in his primary for reelection from Iowa's 4th Congressional District. After racist and pro-white nationalist remarks, much of the Republican establishment abandoned King. They've come for him before in his almost 20 years in Congress unsuccessfully. But this has been their best chance so far. King has trailed in the polls, with only $30,000 cash on hand and no TV ads running. The favorite among his challengers has been state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who painted King as ineffective in the House, given that he was stripped of key committee assignments. But King is well known as a familiar choice for conservatives in western Iowa and has been resilient. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... In Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring, opening up his seat. State Sen. Rita Hart will be the Democratic nominee and will face either state Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks or ex-Illinois Congressman Bobby Schilling, who moved to Iowa in 2017. Miller-Meeks got the backing of Gov. Kim Reynolds and Sen. Joni Ernst, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, have backed Schilling. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Steny Hoyer faces a challenge from the left. A veteran lawmaker from Maryland's 5th Congressional District and No. 2 in House Democratic leadership, Hoyer faces a progressive primary challenge from 29-year-old McKayla Wilkes. Wilkes, a single mother, was inspired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory in New York in 2018 over another veteran white male Democratic leader. Wilkes raised $300,000 and said Hoyer, who has been in Congress almost 40 years, is out of touch with the district. The Democratic establishment has remained behind Hoyer, though, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which endorsed him. He has outspent Wilkes $2.7 million to $237,000. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET Loading... Spy games in New Mexico. The announced retirement of New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall set off a domino effect. Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Luján declared for Udall's Senate seat, leaving open his seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Enter: Valerie Plame, the ex-CIA agent. She has raised and spent more than any candidate in this race and gained national attention with her glossy campaign ad showing her racing backward in a Chevy Camaro on a dusty road. But locally, her candidacy has looked less like an easy Sunday drive. She faced criticism for being a relative newcomer, moving to the area in 2007; the district is 41% Latino and 19% Native American, and another candidate, Teresa Leger Fernandez, got the endorsements of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and EMILY's List. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... It is very possible that New Mexico sends an all-female House delegation to Congress in 2021, as freshman Democrats Deb Haaland and Xochitl Torres Small are the incumbents in the state's other two districts. But Torres Small has to win what's expected to be a tough reelection race in the 2nd District. Trump won there by 10 points in 2016, and the primary to decide who will take Torres Small on this fall is a contest between two Republican women. It has been a nasty primary between Yvette Herrell, the 2018 nominee, and Claire Chase, an oil executive. Both have campaigned on who's the most pro-Trump; Herrell got the backing of the House Freedom Caucus, but Chase has outraised and outspent Herrell, with support from Defending Main Street, a group with ties to establishment Republicans. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET Loading... Senate matchups to be set in Iowa and Montana. Democrats are hoping to take back the Senate this fall. They have an outside shot at that right now, but their odds have looked increasingly better of late. Partially, that's because of these two races. In Iowa, Democrats are targeting incumbent Republican Joni Ernst, but first there's the primary Tuesday. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has backed real estate executive Theresa Greenfield in the four-way contest. Greenfield raised $7.1 million and went into Tuesday as the favorite. Other Democrats include retired Adm. Mike Franken, attorney Kimberly Graham and Eddie Mauro, a businessman and former teacher and coach who has spent the second most — $1.4 million — on this primary. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... When Montana Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock changed his mind and decided to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, it suddenly put this race on the map for Democrats in a big way. Three other Democrats are on the ballot Tuesday, but Bullock has been expected to win easily, raising more than 10 times what his next opponent has. Polls close at 10 p.m. ET Loading... Indiana openings. The retirements of moderate Democrat Pete Visclosky in Indiana's 1st District and Republican Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in Congress, in the 5th District has opened up both of these ideologically divergent seats. More than half a dozen Democrats have competed in the 1st District, which is suburban and exurban Chicago, a place that went for Hillary Clinton with 54% of the vote in 2016. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET Loading... In the 5th District, a handful of Republicans have duked it out, including state Sen. Victoria Spartz, who raised and spent the most and got the backing of the Club for Growth, and Beth Henderson, a local businesswoman with the endorsement of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun. Democrats have rallied around one candidate, Christina Hale. This district has been in GOP hands for a long time, but it could be one to watch this fall.

Many cities imposed curfews, and President Trump again warned he would order active duty military forces to restore order if state and local governments, in his judgement, failed to do so. Here are details of some protests around the country. St. Louis Four police officers were shot and wounded during another night of unrest in St. Louis, according to the city's police chief, John Hayden. In an emotional news conference, Hayden said the officers were hurt in an incident downtown following a day of peaceful protests that drew thousands into the city's streets. He said a couple hundred people ""with no intention of protesting or doing anything constructive"" remained late into the night, looting, vandalizing and throwing objects at police officers. Just after midnight, shots were fired at a line of officers, striking two in the leg, one in the foot and another in the arm, he said. Hayden said none of the injuries were life-threatening. Hayden called Floyd's death tragic but said what was happening in St. Louis was ""mayhem."" ""They're throwing fireworks on officers, fireworks were exploding on officers,"" he said. ""They had officers that had gas poured on them. And you try to figure out what is going on. How can this be?"" Las Vegas There were a pair of shootings overnight in Las Vegas, one of which left a police officer hospitalized and ""in grave condition,"" according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. The first incident took place in front of the famed Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police said they were working to disperse protesters. Lombardo said rocks and bottles were being hurled at police. ""Officers were attempting to get some of the protesters in custody when a shot rang out and our officer went down,"" he said during an early Tuesday morning press briefing. The unnamed officer was transported to a local hospital and is in critical condition, he said. A suspect is in custody. The other incident took place shortly before midnight on Monday, when LVMPD and federal officers were guarding the Foley Federal Building and U.S. courthouse. Lombardo said police encountered a man ""who was armed with multiple firearms and appeared to be wearing body armor."" Then, ""officers engaged him"" and ""the suspect was struck by gunfire,"" Lombardo said. He was later pronounced dead. It is unclear if the man was taking part in the protests prior to his deadly encounter with police. Investigations into both incidents are ongoing. ""With these protests, which are leading to riots, one tragedy is only leading to another,"" Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable. I hope the community sees it that way too."" Omaha, Neb. Protesters gathered in downtown Omaha on Monday for the third consecutive night after Douglas County Attorney Donald Kleine ruled that a white bar owner who shot and killed a 22-year-old black Omaha protester on Saturday acted in self-defense. Protesters carried signs with slogans such as ""Hands up — don't shoot"" and chanted ""Black lives matter,"" according to Megan Feeney, a freelance journalist reporting for NPR member station NET in Omaha. ""A lot of black leaders were saying, 'Don't go downtown tonight, we need to reconsider our approach, think about how we can reorganize and want to avoid any useless violence, pain and potential death,' "" Feeney said. After the start of an 8 p.m. curfew, the protest had shrunk considerably, according to Feeney, and military vehicles blocked streets adjacent to the demonstration. ""Police started to advance and people started running. They ran down an alley, got blocked and some in the crowd started to throw water bottles and other objects while others yelled to stop,"" Feeney said. ""Officers started closing in from all four directions and nobody could leave."" The Omaha Police Department reported two firearms arrests as well as an unspecified number of arrests for curfew violations. New York New York City imposed an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew Monday. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the curfew would begin Tuesday at 8 p.m. Protests were largely peaceful, though some looting was reported at a few luxury retailers, including Macy's flagship store in Manhattan. In Buffalo, a city police officer and New York state trooper were struck by an SUV during a protest. The law enforcement officers were not seriously injured. It was unclear whether the driver intentionally struck the officers. ~~~~~https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freecereports%2Fstatus%2F1267629669093978117https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAliWatkins%2Fstatus%2F1267654230183227393https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fnyspolice%2Fstatus%2F1267655485278339072~~~~~~ Los Angeles In Los Angeles, where some 700 people were arrested on Sunday, there was a heavy police presence in Hollywood and Van Nuys amid multiple protests, mostly peaceful. But looting and vandalism in some areas along Van Nuys Boulevard prompted a response from officers, who fired bean bags. Authorities also responded to a fire at a strip mall, according to the Los Angeles Times. San Francisco Bay Area Some 15,000 people marched peacefully in downtown Oakland, according to a police spokesperson quoted in the East Bay Times. Most dispersed prior to the start of the city's 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. More than 40 people were arrested for violating the curfew, according to the Oakland Police Department. The Alameda County Sheriff's office tweeted late Monday, ""Over 100 people arrested so far. It is time to go home."" In nearby Walnut Creek, several hundred protesters, mostly teenagers and young people, walked onto Interstate 680, according to the East Bay Times. Police in riot gear ordered them to disperse before chasing them with dogs, firing tear gas and rubber bullets, the newspaper said. Police said some protesters had vandalized a handful of vehicles, according to NPR member station KQED. More than a dozen San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions have imposed curfews in the wake of protests sparked by Floyd's death. Corrections: 6/02/20 A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that 15,000 people marched on Interstate 680 in Walnut Creek, Calif., and were dispersed by police.

""Let me be clear: The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese without permission as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our churches stand for,"" Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde told CNN. ""And to do so... he sanctioned the use of tear gas by police officers in riot gear to clear the church yard. I am outraged,"" Budde said. Budde is the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese Washington, overseeing more than 80 Episcopal congregations, including St. John's. She is the first woman to serve in her position. Follow this story:For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up to get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox Trump had just delivered an address from the Rose Garden Monday evening, pledging to be a ""law and order"" president and calling himself an ally to peaceful protesters. As he spoke, officers used tear gas canisters, rubber bullets and shields to force hundreds of protesters out of Lafayette Park by the White House. They had been peacefully demonstrating for several hours, demanding justice for George Floyd, who died while in police custody after a Minneapolis officer pinned Floyd's neck down with his knee. George Floyd protests rage for seventh night:New York protesters smash windows on Fifth Avenue; National Guard in Chicago, Philadelphia Despite an official D.C. curfew set for 7 p.m. ET, the officers began pushing the crowd out at 6:30 p.m., shortly before Trump's remarks. The president later walked with White House aides to the historical St. John's Episcopal Church, where protesters set fire in the basement on Sunday night. Across from Lafayette Park, St. John's is known as the ""church of presidents"" and has been attended at least once by every president since James Madison. ""It's a Bible,"" Trump told reporters as he held it up for photos outside the boarded-up church. Trump addresses nation:Calling violent protests 'acts of domestic terror,' Trump says he'll send in military if they aren't controlled Trump's visit drew immediate backlash from those who criticized the police's use of force to clear his path to the church for a ""photo op."" ""Were thousands of peaceful protestors just tear gassed so Trump could have a photo op?"" tweeted Dan Pfeiffer, a communications director for former President Barack Obama. Rev. Robert Fisher, of St. John's Church, told Fox News Monday evening that whoever set the fire in the church's basement ""does not represent the majority of people that are out there peacefully protesting with an important message."" He said clergy members were present during the afternoon to hand out water and prayed with protesters, which was ""very hopeful, very peaceful, very loving."" Fisher called Trump's visit ""surreal."" Budde said she and her colleagues were given no notice Trump would be visiting the church, and found out while watching the news. ""The president did not pray when he came to St. John’s, nor … did he acknowledge the agony of our country right now, and in particular, the people of color in our nation who wonder if anyone in public power will ever acknowledge their sacred work, and who are rightfully demanding an end to 400 years of systemic racism and white supremacy in our country,"" Budde said. The Diocese of Washington distances itself ""from the incendiary language of this president,"" Budde said. She said the diocese stands with those protesting racism and police brutality. ""I just can’t believe what my eyes have seen tonight,"" Budde said.",0.0

Biden joined several governors, senators from both parties and two high-level church leaders in deriding President Donald Trump's handling of the protests. In Washington, D.C., protesters were back at the area near the White House where they were dispersed with harsh tactics the day before despite their peaceful behavior. And in Los Angeles -- where police say they have arrested more than 2,700 -- thousands of demonstrators took to the streets. Some are demanding the firing of the city's police chief over remarks he made about looting in the nation's second-largest city. A closer look at some recent developments: Six Atlanta police officers are facing charges over an incident caught on video where they are seen using stun guns and forcefully removing two college students from a car. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said an investigation would be launched into the Minneapolis Police Department, which is also facing a civil rights complaint. George Floyd's funeral will be held June 9 in his hometown of Houston. The family accepted an offer from former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. to pay for the funeral services. There will be two memorial services held in Minneapolis and North Carolina before the funeral. Remembering George Floyd:Memorial services, funeral to be held in Minnesota, North Carolina and Texas How to talk to your kids:Floyd. Arbery. Taylor. What do we tell our children? Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Large protest again near White House Crowds in the thousands chanted, ""I can't breathe'' on a fifth day of protests in Washington, D.C., as demonstrators returned to the area near the White House where they were forcefully removed Monday. Law enforcement had used what appeared to be tear gas -- officials later said they were gas canisters -- shields and horses to clear out a group of peaceful demonstrators to make way for President Donald Trump's visit to a nearby church. There, he stood and was photographed holding a Bible. Several thousand protesters were gathered north of Lafayette Square on Tuesday, forced onto an adjacent street by a large, black chain link fence that had been installed overnight around the park. Gone, for the moment, were the confrontational police lines that were so prominent a day before. It wasn't clear how forcefully police would enforce the 7 p.m. ET curfew. L.A. police chief apologizes for remarks amid calls for his firing Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore has apologized and is fending off calls for his firing after likening looters in the city to those responsible for George Floyd's death. ""We didn't have protests last night. We had criminal acts,"" Moore said Monday. ""We didn't have people mourning the death of this man, George Floyd. We had people capitalizing. His death is on their hands, as much as it is those officers."" Moore tweeted out an apology, saying he misspoke. ""While I did immediately correct myself, I recognize that my initial words were terribly offensive,'' Moore said via Twitter. ""Looting is wrong, but it is not the equivalent of murder and I did not mean to equate the two. I deeply regret and humbly apologize for my characterization.'' Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti was called out on social media, with people demanding that he fire Moore. Later Tuesday, protesters gathered at Garcetti's home. On Tuesday, more than 1,000 protesters made their way for a second day through the streets of Hollywood, and several hundred demonstrated in downtown Los Angeles, at times kneeling en masse and at others calling for Moore's resignation. -- Jordan Culver Mother of Floyd's daughter speaks out about her loss The mother of George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter lamented that he'll miss the girl's future milestones, like graduating and getting married, in her first public comments since he died in police custody May 25. From a podium at the city hall in Minneapolis, where Floyd moved from Houston seeking better work opportunities, Roxie Washington said she wanted to speak up for him and their daughter Gianna, who joined her. Washington also said she wants justice for Floyd. “He’ll never see her grow up, graduate. He will never walk her down the aisle,'' said Washington, who struggled to fight back tears. ""If there’s a problem she’s had and needs her dad, she does not have that anymore.” -- Mark Emmert Six Atlanta officers charged in incident with college students Six Atlanta police officers seen on video forcefully pulling two young college students out of their car during Saturday protests have been charged, mostly with aggravated assault, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said. Two of the officers, investigators Ivory Streeter and Mark Gardner, were fired Sunday. The incident was caught on body cam video and denounced by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Messiah Young and his girlfriend Taniyah Pilgrim were caught in traffic Saturday night during protests over George Floyd's killing when they were approached by the officers yelling commands. The video shows the officers using stun guns on the couple, breaking the car window with a baton and yanking out both students, who are heard screaming and asking what was happening. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,'' Bottoms said, ""but we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.'' Another church leader denounces Trump For the second day in a row, a high-ranking church official has taken issue with President Donald Trump's actions. A day after a much-criticized photo op at a fire-damaged Episcopal church near the White House, Trump took his anti-protester ""law and order"" message to a Catholic shrine Tuesday, a visit that drew swift condemnation from a top church official. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The Trumps posed for photos and stood for a few minutes in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory expressed his disapproval of the presidential visit, saying in a statement: “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree.” On Monday, Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington told CNN she was ""outraged'' that police in riot gear had used tear gas to clear a path across Lafayette Park for Trump and other members of his administration to walk to St. John's Episcopal Church for a photo-op. -- David Jackson, Michael Collins and Nicholas Wu GOP senators criticize Trump: 'Word of God as a political prop' Minnesota files human rights complaint against Minneapolis police The Minnesota Department of Human Rights said it will file a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department in the death of George Floyd and begin an investigation. According to a news release, the investigation will focus on policies, procedures and practices over the past 10 years to ""determine if the MPD has engaged in systemic discriminatory practices towards people of color and ensure any such practices are stopped."" “Silence is complicity,'' Gov. Tim Walz said in a statement. ""Minnesotans can expect our administration to use every tool at our disposal to deconstruct generations of systemic racism in our state.” -- Mark Emmert Biden blasts Trump, urges national unity Former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday invoked George Floyd's last words, ""I can't breathe"" to address the nation's escalating protests and racial tensions. Biden, speaking at Philadelphia City Hall, criticized President Donald Trump's handling of the protests, accusing him of trafficking in ""fear and division."" But he added that problems of racism and social injustice in America go beyond Trump. ""I wish I could say that hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. But it didn't and it won't,"" Biden said. ""American history is not a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending."" Minneapolis officers fire paint ""marking rounds"" to enforce curfew A video shared on social media appears to show Minneapolis law enforcement shooting ""marking rounds"" of green paint at people standing on their front porch last weekend. The video, which was shared by Minneapolis resident Tanya Kerssen on Saturday evening, shows a Humvee and an officer dressed in riot gear passing by her home to enforce curfew. A group of around 15 to 20 police officers and National Guardsmen then approach the front of the house, shouting, ""Go inside!"" five or six times and, ""Get in your house now!"" After around 10 seconds of commands, one officer yells, ""Light 'em up,"" and starts shooting green paint bullets at Kerssen and other unidentified people, according to the video. Neither Kerssen nor the police department immediately responded to a request for comment from USA TODAY. – Joshua Bote New York City gets earlier curfew after night of violence, looting New York City will impose an 8 p.m. curfew for the remainder of the week after violent protests Monday night led to more than 700 arrests. Mayor Bill de Blasio vowed Tuesday to halt looting and violence, saying an 11 p.m. curfew Monday failed to quell the dangerous situation. The looting spread across the boroughs and in midtown Manhattan, where store windows were smashed, goods stolen and fights broke out. ""We saw stuff last night that we will not accept. And we can fight back and we will fight back,"" de Blasio said. – Joseph Spector Truck driver who drove into protesters in Minneapolis released The truck driver who drove into protesters on a Minneapolis interstate over the weekend was released from jail Tuesday, while prosecutors investigate the incident, the Star-Tribune reported. Bogdan Vechirko was jailed Sunday evening on suspicion of assault and held until midday Tuesday in connection with his empty fuel tanker narrowly missing a crowd marching in protest, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said in a statement to the Star-Tribune. “Investigators are in the process of gathering additional information and answers to aid in the charging decision,” the statement continued. Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington told the newspaper Monday that there was no information that made the incident seem intentional. -- Elinor Aspegren Federal prisons locked down The federal Bureau of Prisons has imposed a national lockdown in a move resembling the agency's response to mass rioting at several facilities 25 years ago. Federal authorities, already struggling to contain deadly outbreaks of the coronavirus that has left 68 inmates dead, had ordered nationwide restrictions on inmate movements in March in an attempt to limit the virus' spread. But officials took the more restrictive action late Monday, citing the sometimes violent protests on the nation's streets. ""In light of extensive protest activity occurring around the country, the BOP – in an abundance of caution – is implementing an additional, temporary security measure to ensure the good order and security of our institutions,"" the bureau said in a statement. – Kevin Johnson TikTok apologizes for #GeorgeFloyd, #BlackLivesMatter glitches TikTok promised to promote diversity on its platform and denied claims the social media service blocked posts featuring hashtags related to the death of George Floyd. TikTok said a technical glitch made it temporarily appear as if posts with the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd received no views. The platform said it was dealing with a display issue, and videos featuring those tags amassed more than 2 billion views. The problem was not ""an intentional act to suppress the experiences and invalidate the emotions felt by the Black community,"" read an apology blog post from Vanessa Pappas, TikTok's general manager, and director of creator community Kudzi Chikumbu. – Brett Molina Music industry, social media go silent for Blackout Tuesday The music industry took a break from business-as-usual to mark Blackout Tuesday to call attention to the deaths of George Floyd and other black Americans. Big names in entertainment such as Katy Perry, Kylie Jenner, Kevin Hart and Timothee Chalamet showed their support Tuesday on social media, using the hashtags #blackouttuesday and #theshowmustbepaused to help draw attention to the effort. ""While this is only one day, we are working on ways to actively fight for meaningful, systematic change against the injustices black people continue to face,"" the post from the official @hamiltonmusical Instagram account read. – Gary Dinges What is Blackout Tuesday? The social media trend explained More protest coverage from USA TODAY Protesters in DC take shelter inside resident's home after curfew Dozens of protesters took refuge inside a stranger's home in Washington overnight Monday as police funneled a crowd of demonstrators onto one street after a 7 p.m. citywide curfew. Rahul Dubey told NBC Washington that he acted instinctively when he opened his door to roughly 60 demonstrators near his house around 10 p.m., and allowed them to stay until the curfew was lifted at 6 a.m. Reports on social media showed police corralling a group of demonstrators onto one D.C. street as they used pepper spray on the crowd. Dubey told the TV station he was also pepper sprayed. ""The crowd came racing through like a tornado,"" he said. ""We had to keep the door open and keep pulling them in. ... It's the same you would do if there's a storm."" – Ryan W. Miller Man fatally shot, officer critically injured at Las Vegas protests One man was dead and a Las Vegas police officer was on life support Tuesday following a night of angry protests that included two separate shooting incidents. Sheriff Joe Lombardo said officers were attempting to clear protesters throwing rocks and bottles from Las Vegas Boulevard when the officer was shot sometime before midnight. The officer was in ""grave"" condition, Lombardo said. Lombardo said the second incident involved the fatal shooting of an armed man wearing body armor by police and federal agents guarding a federal building in downtown Las Vegas. Lombardo said the man had reached for a firearm. Investigations of both shootings were continuing, Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable,"" Lombardo said. ""I hope the community sees it that way, too."" 4 officers shot in St. Louis, police say Four St. Louis police officers were shot early Tuesday as a peaceful protest devolved into ""mayhem,"" Police Chief John Hayden said. The police department tweeted that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening after the shootings overnight. It was unclear who had fired the shots. Several hundred people rallied peacefully Monday afternoon outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protesters later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64. But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire.

Cincinnati Enquirer On Monday night, Cincinnati Police began rounding up peaceful protesters for breaking curfew, ending the night early for many. At about 8:15 p.m., dozens of officers with riot shields marched down McMicken Avenue and began making arrests. Some protesters ran. Others put their hands up. On Monday, the arrests happened in daylight. The curfew had been moved up an hour, and it seemed to help. There were no reports of tear gas or pepper balls used by police. It was tense, and then it was over. Around 9 p.m., Cincinnati police reported between 40 and 50 arrests had been made. More than 300 were made the previous night. Nationwide protests continue Protests nationwide continued for the seventh day in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis — including peaceful demonstrations in Phoenix and Fort Worth, Texas, among other places — but there were contentious moments in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere. Police say four officers were hit by gunfire after protests in St. Louis that started peacefully Monday became violent overnight, with demonstrators smashing windows and stealing items from businesses and fires burning in the downtown area. Cincinnati Enquirer journalist detained during protest coverage A Cincinnati Enquirer reporter was briefly detained by police while covering protests in the city Monday evening. Patrick Brennan was with other journalists after curfew near McMicken Avenue when he was detained. Journalists are considered essential workers and are exempt from the curfew. They have been covering the protests for several days. Brennan was detained shortly after the arrests started Monday night. Nick Swartsell, who works for CityBeat, captured video of the incident and posted it on Twitter. ""Police grabbing media,"" Swartsell tweeted. ""I was grabbed by my bandana from behind and pulled into a group of officers as they approached me. An Enquirer reporter just hauled off."" Brennan, who covers FC Cincinnati and has been helping with protest coverage, was released at around 8:55 p.m. without being charged. Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley said the incident was ""a big mistake"" in a statement posted on Twitter. ""The buck stops with me and I sincerely apologize,"" he wrote. People wait outside the Justice Center in Downtown Cincinnati, Tuesday, June 2, 2020. The public defenders office was signing up people outside the Justice Center, due to the large number of people arrested during the protests. People across the country have been protesting since the death of George Floyd over Memorial Day Weekend. Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been charged with 3rd degree murder and manslaughter. Chauvin was fired from the police department. (Photo: Liz Dufour / The Enquirer) Arrested protesters held outside overnight, complain about conditions Protesters arrested overnight in Cincinnati took to social media early Monday to complain that they'd been held outside without food, water or access to bathrooms. ""This is scary,"" a young woman said in an Instagram post that appeared to have been recorded from the holding area. ""There are people that are being held outside at the jail. We're being denied basic human rights. Hamilton County sheriff's spokesman David Daugherty disputed the description of conditions at the jail and said everyone who has been detained has been treated well. He said about 100 of the 171 people arrested Sunday night were being held in a sally port at the Justice Center, which is enclosed on all sides but open on top. From there, he said, inmates are being brought into the Justice Center to be booked. CLOSE Sunday night's protestors are released from the Justice Center and greeted with food, water and medical help from friends and other protestors.

1623208714,2020-06-01 06:21:30,Why You Must Have an Honest Discussion About Race with Yourself,https://womiowensboro.com/why-its-important-to-have-an-honest-discussion-about-race-with-yourself/,en,False,,661031,WOMI,http://1490womi.com/,"Many white people are afraid to say something because they don’t want to touch anything relating to racism- but we need to support our brothers and sisters. We need to hold them up and be loud. We need to fight with them. Don’t ask them to educate you. You educate you. - Chelsea Handler I fully intended to share this admission during Black History Month, but something about the timing wasn’t right. After watching the events of the last five or six days unfold in our country and seeing very mixed reactions to the protest Saturday here in Owensboro, the time to share is now. And, buckle up. This isn’t going to be fun. For many of you, like me, this is going to be a painful look in the mirror and a reminder that you are just as responsible for the state of local race relations as anyone else- regardless of how “woke” you think you are. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been much discussion about this year’s crop of high school seniors and all the anticipated rites of passage the virus stole from them: Senior Week, prom, graduation. When I was a senior at Daviess County High School back in 1989, we had those same rites of passage and other ones as well. One of them was called Slave Day. No. I’m not kidding. I wish I was. Yes. We had a senior event called Slave Day. On Slave Day, seniors at Daviess County High would gather in the school lobby, where a public “auction” was held. At the auction, we were allowed to “purchase” underclassmen who would stand on a platform in the middle of the lobby and be sold to the highest bidder. Those “slaves” would then spend the entire day carrying our books to class, being forced to wear goofy costumes, essentially being dehumanized by the graduating seniors who bought them. Yes, as a senior, I bought my fair share of Panther slaves and forced them to roll out a red carpet into every classroom I entered, announce my arrival and shower me with confetti as I entered. Now, you may have giggled because that’s a very “Chad” thing to do. But participating in something called “Slave Day” is not. I can’t believe I ever took part in something so disgusting and racially insensitive. As someone who doesn’t really carry around regret, some thirty years later I can’t shake the regret of “Slave Day.” But here’s the sad truth and why I decided to share this. It never occurred to me or my classmates that it was racially insensitive. That’s how painfully white and stupid we were. Look, I was a smart kid. A lot of my friends were smart kids. We were in AP classes, rocked out the ACT, scored 100s on our high school history tests. Sure. We learned all about slavery in Mr. Nall’s history class. We just didn’t realize that we were living in world still shaped by that history. And why would we? At DCHS, we literally had a handful of black students in the entire student body and certainly didn’t have a clue about their experiences and how they were the result of that same, shared, horrible history. And there we were, rallying in the high school lobby for a school-sanctioned slave auction. I have no clue how our black students perceived that annual event. How would I? None of us would ever have thought to ask. Over the weekend, my friend Matt Purcell admitted on his Facebook page that “White privilege is a real thing."" Yes. It is. And “Slave Day” at a local high school was ghastly, embarrassing proof of it. And, to that, I’ll ask this. Where were the adults? Oh, yeah. That’s right. They were white too. Like many of you, I grew up with certain relatives around me who were racists. Their actions and the prejudicial things they would say were often dismissed with excuses for their behaviors. “They’re old” or “That’s just how things were when they grew up. That’s how they were raised.” Such dismissals, for generations, have basically served as green lights for the continuation of those mindsets. If you don’t think that’s still being passed from generation to generation, you’re not paying attention. Each of us, whether we are willing to admit it, are products of a society that once told the people who shaped us that being racist was okay or the norm. I’d like to think that we have evolved beyond it. But we haven’t and I see it often. And, yes. That means right here in this community where, let’s not forget, the last public hanging in the United States took place. I won’t go into the specific details of that case, but it was as racially charged as anything you’ll read about local history. It’s historically estimated that 20,000 people were on hand to witness that hanging. According to newspaper accounts around the country, it was a virtual circus. Reportedly, there were even vendors selling hot dogs, popcorn and drinks. The uncomfortable truth? It's entirely possible that you had relatives that flocked downtown to watch it. That’s part of our history and, unfortunately, we don’t have the power to reshape it. But we can shape our future. As I write this, I can’t help but think about my friend Angela Oliver, who moved to Owensboro to write for the Messenger-Inquirer. Angela’s a gifted writer, a vocal and spirited advocate for social change and she has a smile that is genuine, beautiful, and infectious. Angela lives in Atlanta now because, quite frankly, we drove her out of town. Angela used to recount to me the absolutely shocking things that white people in this community would say to her. She would lament the various “micro-aggressions” she endured on a daily basis- from people you would never expect. Some of them in the public eye; some of them in local leadership positions. When she decided to move, she wrote a scathing goodbye letter to Owensboro and posted it to social media. In it, she detailed her “years of being the first/only different in a room. Sometimes feeling like a token.” Routinely, local white people would tell Angela, after talking with her on the phone and then meeting her in person, that they “didn’t know she was black.” There, sadly and shockingly, were also people who would refuse to shake her hand when they met her in person. Of her time in Owensboro, Angela said, “It can be draining . . . to keep explaining to racists why they shouldn’t be racist.” Angela said she never experienced anything like it before she moved to Kentucky, but “Owensboro is a sunken place like nothing I’ve ever known.” About a year ago or so, I met another vibrant African-American woman who had just moved back to Owensboro from a major American city. We clicked immediately and bonded over our shared love of New York. In a board meeting for a local non-profit, I asked her “What’s it like being back in Owensboro.” Her answer, “It’s very strange being back in a place where I’m judged not for my talents, but for the color of my skin.” Two men in that meeting, both white, responded the same way. They questioned her interpretation with claims that “It’s not like that here.” Now, I know these guys and they meant no real harm. But their response was shaped by their own “privilege.” Why are white men trying to correct a black woman about her own experience in her hometown? Here at WBKR/WOMI, we have a fabulous receptionist named Candace. Candace, too, is African-American. I mentioned to Candace, months ago, that I was going to write this story. I asked her to share some of her own experiences as a black woman living in Owensboro. She said, “With me and my girlfriends, it’s an accepted fact that we aren’t going to get a job in this town unless we have a white friend who works somewhere.” The irony of Candace’s statement is that it’s precisely how she got her job at the radio station. Now, I would have hired Candace in a heartbeat. She is hard-working, dependable, project-oriented, great for morale and absolutely hilarious. She is the first person any guest to our studio sees and she is a glorious welcome wagon. But my friend Debbie is how I found out about Candace. Debbie, as a matter of fact, interviewed for the same job and essentially insisted that she withdraw from consideration so Candace would get the position. But what a shame that Candace has been programmed by local circumstances and societal constructs to think she needs someone white, like Debbie (who’s an amazing ally, by the way), to be employable. I spent the weekend watching news of protests and riots and feeling a tremendous sense of sadness for our country. I don’t know what the answer is, but I know that we, as white folks, are equally responsible (maybe even more responsible) for finding it. Yes, it hurts to admit it, but all of us have dirt on our hands. We have to wash clean those parts of our upbringing and history that have shaped the racial divide. My high school class, as recently as 1989, hosted Slave Day. I also remember going with my friends to a local club here in town. It was a “membership” club back in the mid-80s. It was later relayed to me that it was once believed that you had to be white to get a membership card. I remember my reaction when I heard that. I thought, “You’ve got to be kidding me! That is ridiculous.” But you know what? It didn’t stop me from going. My friends either. Yes. We were appalled by it, but not enough to take a stand that would require some sort of self-sacrifice. We were young once. And white. And privileged. And stupid. I write this today embarrassed that I couldn’t see beyond my own experience back then. But I am so thankful than I can today. Look, anyone who knows me knows that I am about as progressive as they get. Luckily, I was able to outgrow “the way I grew up” and “how it was back then.” But even I am still a work in progress. I was reminded of this a couple of months ago by my dear friend Latasha Shemwell. She doesn’t know the impact her words had on me, but here’s what she posted on her Facebook page during Black History Month. Stop telling us you don't see color. It is not a compliment. It's an excuse for complacency. I am black, and I want you to see that, and recognize that. In order to mitigate unconscious bias you need to be able to be self-aware and you cannot do that if you insist on being ""color blind"". I am a black woman, I navigate the world as such, those experiences have shaped me. Be self-aware enough to acknowledge the experiences of others, especially when they are different from your own. Recognize people's experiences, recognize how they are seen by the world, recognize who people are. I’ll admit it. I have been guilty of claiming to not see color. Truth is- I have friends from all walks of life, all colors, ethnicities, sexualities, religions, etc. I wouldn’t live my life any other way. But Latasha’s right. To claim not to see color is not a compliment. It IS an excuse for complacency. And what we have learned from the events of the last week is that we cannot be complacent. We must speak up for our brothers and sisters. Hold them up. Be loud and fight for them. Brothers and sisters, I can’t speak for anyone else but I promise you. I am trying.",0.0
1623213134,2020-06-02 07:22:50,The morning after: What happened at Monday's David McAtee and Breonna Taylor protests,http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625855988/0/courierjournal/news~The-morning-after-What-happened-at-Mondays-David-McAtee-and-Breonna-Taylor-protests/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"By midnight, it was quiet at Dino’s Food Mart. It wasn’t always like this. A shooting at the 26th Street and Broadway business by law enforcement in the early hours of Monday morning that killed Louisville barbecue shop owner David McAtee ignited another full day and night of rallies and demonstrations across the city, after four previous days of protests over the police shooting of Breonna Taylor. But as the clock hit midnight, the scene at Dino's (after a brief fire) had mostly cleared. Protesters came out to Jefferson Square Park in downtown Louisville once again on Monday, in the hours after Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad was fired over McAtee's killing — the law enforcement personnel behind the trigger (a number of LMPD officers and National Guard soldiers fired at McAtee) were not wearing operational body cameras. But when acting Chief Robert Schroeder spoke about 11:30 p.m., he said few arrests had taken place. The latest: LMPD officer in fatal shooting of David McAtee had mocked protester on Facebook Monday was tumultuous, and the headlines of the day will shape what happens in Louisville on Tuesday. Here's a quick look at what happened Monday evening. David McAtee's death We won't use this space to go into too much specific detail about the killing of David McAtee. Our previous coverage of the circumstances surrounding the shooting can be read here, while you can read about the investigation into the matter here and read about McAtee's life and place in the community here. When it became clear that body camera footage would not be available, though, Conrad was fired. Fischer announced the move about 4 p.m., and Gov. Andy Beshear made his support clear at a 5:30 p.m. press briefing — ""it had to happen,"" a visibly discouraged Beshear said more than once. Earlier in the day, he'd stressed that the body camera footage in this case would be important. Fischer also announced at that teleconference that Louisville's 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. curfew that had been in effect Saturday and Sunday would extend throughout the week until Monday, June 8. It will be reevaulated at that point. Rallying at Dino's The rally at Dino's began after McAtee's shooting and lasted all day. McAtee's body was left at the scene until early afternoon, prompting outrage among some protesters. Fischer said he empathized and was initially outaged himself, until the reasoning was explained — fewer investigators were available to look into the case, he said, and those who responded had to interview more than 100 witnesses from the large group that was present for the shooting. The mayor apologized over the incident but said the peaceful daylong protest was ""incredible"" to see, making note of one woman who sang ""Amazing Grace"" to a silent crowd of mourners. A powerful moment happened on 26th and Broadway when family went to see the body of David McAtee. The crowd was silent, except for one woman. pic.twitter.com/cUNyQuLTX5 — Dominique Yates (@RealDYates) June 1, 2020 ""This could have been a situation that got out of control very quickly, but like we’ve seen from many folks in the West End, it was peaceful,"" Fischer said. 26th and Broadway tensions It wasn't peaceful all night at Dino's. A small fire brought out a heavy emergency personnel response just before 11 p.m. Police at the scene nearly clashed with some of the protesters, The Courier Journal's Mandy McLaren and Sarah Ladd reported, but another group of demonstrators in the crowd helped diffuse the situation.

June 1, 2020 (Photo: Matt Stone/Courier Journal) That group, with at least three LMPD officers marching arm-in-arm with them, walked back to Jefferson Square Park, one of Louisville's most notable protest sites of the past week, and held what Courier Journal reporter Phillip M. Bailey described as an ""occupation"" until law enforcement responded at 10 p.m. by launching tear gas into the crowd. Those protesters scattered through downtown. Schroeder, the acting police chief, said later in the evening that just three arrests occurred. Police believe two people in the crowd fired guns during the commotion, he added, though no injuries were reported. LMPD officer mocking protesters Katie Crews, one of the LMPD officers involved in McAtee's killing, had previously mocked protesters in a Facebook post in the days leading up to the shooting, Schroeder confirmed. Crews posted a Courier Journal photo on social media of a protester holding a flower up to her during a protest that had taken place on Thursday. After saying she hoped the protester was injured by pepper balls fired at her later that evening, Crews ended the post with: ""Come back and get ya some more ole girl, I’ll be on the line again tonight.” A professional standards investigation into the matter has started, Schroeder said. Website for Breonna Taylor leads to Louisville Metro Police Foundation Meanwhile, it was reported that the URL breonnataylor.com redirected users to a page encouraging donations to the Louisville Metro Police Foundation. That organization later said it had nothing to do with the website and disavowed it as inappropriate — it had been taken off the web later Monday night. Person who was shot speaks out And finally, one of seven people shot at Thursday night's Breonna Taylor protest spoke with The Courier Journal's David J. Kim about his injuries, and the fear he faced as he got a ride after he was struck by bullets from a still-unidentified shooter. ""I said ‘I’m dying. Could you give me a ride to the hospital? I’ve been shot,'"" the victim, 36-year-old William Clark, told Kim. Lucas Aulbach can be reached at laulbach@courier-journal.com, 502-582-4649 or on Twitter @LucasAulbach.

1623213130,2020-06-02 06:36:54,Mayor Fischer says Louisville welcomes peaceful protest. Why was one cleared with tear gas?,http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625856036/0/courierjournal/news~Mayor-Fischer-says-Louisville-welcomes-peaceful-protest-Why-was-one-cleared-with-tear-gas/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Community leaders are questioning the decision by the Louisville Metro Police Department to clear a nonviolent demonstration with tear gas, saying it was inconsistent with Mayor Greg Fischer’s embrace of peaceful protest. They said a disconnect exists between the support for such expression that Fischer announced at a news conference Sunday night and Assistant Police Chief LaVita Chavous’ declaration that the crowd was dispersed Sunday because it was an unlawful gathering. “It is insane to thank people for peaceful protest and then use tear gas because you call it an unlawful gathering,” Sadiqa Reynolds, president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League, said in a tweet. “The mayor and LMPD are not on the same page and it is embarrassing."" Louisville Metro Councilman Bill Hollander said in an interview that police have a “difficult job in the current situation,” but he had heard from constituents who attended the protest and “were surprised by the use of tear gas before they were told to be home and when they saw nothing but peaceful activity,” Hollander called for an investigation of police tactics over the weekend, which included using tear gas Friday and Saturday nights without announcing it would be deployed. State Sen. Morgan McGarvey, who was at Jefferson Square on Sunday, said in a tweet that “there was no unrest that I saw. It was peaceful before the curfew.” He attached a photo he said was taken 14 minutes before tear gas was used showing a pastoral scene with protesters standing among plants and flowers. Read this: Louisville police release video they say shows McAtee shooting at officers Reynolds said in an interview that Fischer had not responded to her tweet, and spokespeople for the mayor and LMPD did not respond to questions about whether all demonstrators will now be cleared with tear gas. However, at a department news conference Tuesday, Maj. Dave Allen said tear gas was deployed because police observed numerous homemade weapons in the crowd and on the streets, including Molotov cocktail, bricks, wooden blocks, leaf blowers and jars that had been filled with urine and vomit. He also showed some with objects that could be used as shields. Allen said protesters would not be dispersed if only one of those things were observed, but he said the combination made police decide to shut down the rally. Chavous said Sunday that demonstrators were dispersed because they had gathered illegally without a permit — the first time that reason was given since protests began Thursday night over Breonna Taylor’s death at the hands of police. She and department spokeswoman Jessie Halladay said police acted before the 9 p.m. curfew because of reports that some protesters had leaf blowers that could be used to direct chemicals at police. But in an interview, Louisville Metro Council President David James, a former police officer, said if that was the case, protesters with those devices should have been arrested. He said when he heard people were being gassed — and called the mayor to ask about it — Fischer said he didn’t know it was occurring, suggesting Chavous didn’t consult the mayor about the move. Chavous told reporters it was her decision. Fischer spokeswoman Jean Porter said in a statement Tuesday that LMPD is there ""to protect public safety and keep order, and they make the decision to use tear gas when they believe that is in jeopardy."" She said Fischer is ""sorry that some peaceful protesters were caught up in that."" Experts on policing protests said tear gas should only be deployed to quell violence or aggression toward police. “Don’t use tear gas if there is no violence,” said Maria Haberfeld, who specializes in police training and use of force at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. She also said most departments give warnings before it is deployed, to allow protesters to disperse first. Related: Protesters question police tactics used prior to Louisville's curfew time Experts, including Sam Walker, who teaches criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, said police should focus on “unruly troublemakers” rather than those protesting peacefully. So-called differentiated policing promotes lawful behavior while addressing those engaged in violence, reducing ""widespread defiance or rebellion,"" according to a report titled “Policing Protests” published in January based on a study of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, and in the occupy movement. Former Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper, who was forced to resign in 1999 after protests at the World Trade Organization meeting morphed into widespread violence dubbed the Battle for Seattle, told researchers later that “the worst decision of my career” was using tear gas against “nonviolent and essentially non-threatening protesters.” “The natural consequence … was that we were the catalyst for heightened tension rather than peacekeepers,” he said. “A whole lot of others would not have acted the way they did if we had not acted as we did.” The city’s WTO Accountability Review Committee found that demonstrators and members of the public were victims of “sometimes pointless actions to clear the streets.” See also: Louisville business owners angry with response to looting Former Vancouver, Canada, Deputy Police Chief Doug LePard told the Police Executive Research Forum that it won over protesters — including anarchists from around the world — at the Winter Olympics in 2010 with a “meet and greet” strategy. “Instead of using riot officers in Darth Vader outfits … we're out there high-fiving, shaking hands, asking people how they’re doing and telling the crowd that ‘we are here to keep you safe,’’’ he said. On opening night, protesters were hurling barricades and rocks and sticks and even throwing marbles under police officers to try to make them lose their footing. “They were spitting in the faces of officers, who were wearing soft uniforms and no helmets,” LePard said, “They were doing everything they could to provoke a harsh response from police. But they didn’t get it.” Andrew Wolfson: 502-582-7189; awolfson@courier-journal.com; Twitter: @adwolfson. Support strong local journalism by subscribing today: courier-journal.com/andreww.

1623213126,2020-06-02 06:39:35,The last time Louisville called in the National Guard was 45 years ago. Here's why,http://rssfeeds.courier-journal.com/~/625856480/0/courierjournal/news~The-last-time-Louisville-called-in-the-National-Guard-was-years-ago-Heres-why/,en,False,,91426,Courier-Journal,https://www.courier-journal.com/#spider,"CLOSE LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Deployments of the National Guard in Louisville — and curfews on adults in Kentucky’s largest city — have been few and far between. According to The Courier Journal’s archives, the last time the Kentucky National Guard was called out in Louisville was to quell violence in September 1975 during protests of court-order busing to achieve desegregation. Gov. Julian Carroll called more than 900 Kentucky Army National Guardsmen to active duty in Louisville. They were armed with weapons and live ammunition, but state Adjutant Gen. Richard Frymire cautioned them about the volatile emotions stirred by school busing. ""I told them to be especially careful to show good military courtesy and to be especially patient with demonstrators,” Frymire said, noting that each was trained to fire only if in danger. Louisville Mayor Harvey Sloane also ordered a ban on demonstrations or parades in the city. The last time a curfew was imposed on adults in Louisville was in April 1974, after devastating tornadoes killed 10 people and destroyed neighborhoods. Top headlines: Louisville mayor fires LMPD Chief Steve Conrad About 750 National Guardsman patrolled in the worst-hit areas to keep out looters and sightseers. The curfew was imposed only in the disaster area. In 1968, after riots in the West End, Mayor Kenneth Schmied imposed a curfew that was enforced by National Guard, who also protected firefighters as they tried to distinguish blazes. Residents were ordered off the streets from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m., and taverns, liquor stores and movie theaters were closed. More than 100 people were arrested for violations, but many charges were dismissed because they were on their way home when they were picked up or didn’t know about the curfew. More than 1,000 Kentucky National Guardsmen helped restore order after rioting erupted a second night at 28th and Greenwood streets. Police Chief C.J. Hyde said it was easier to control because most people cooperated with an 8 p.m. curfew. In February 1945, a midnight curfew was ordered in Louisville and across the country by the War Manpower Commission to conserve electricity, fuel, manpower and transportation facilities. Louisville Safety Director Donaldson said the dumping on the streets at midnight of revelers ""has made no appreciable difference in our policing job.” Kentucky state law allows the governor or county executives to declare curfews in the event of disasters or other emergencies. 'My son didn't hurt nobody': David McAtee, business owner, killed by authorities The governor, who is by law designated as commander in chief of the Kentucky active militia, has the power to deploy the Kentucky National Guard. It is not uncommon for cities to impose curfews after civil disturbances. At least 25 have enacted curfews to control protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In 2015, Baltimore, in response to rioting after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, the city enacted a curfew for five days and prohibited all citizens from going outdoors from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., with the exception of those traveling to or from work and those with medical emergencies. In 1992, authorities in Los Angeles imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew and deployed the National Guard to help quell citywide civil disturbances, after the acquittal of Los Angeles Police Department officers involved in the beating of Rodney King. During five days of unrest, there were more than 50 riot-related deaths — including 10 people who were shot and killed by LAPD officers and National Guardsmen. More than 2,000 people were injured, and nearly 6,000 alleged looters and arsonists were arrested.

Louisville Courier Journal LOUISVILLE, Ky. — After suffering damage and looting the previous morning, one of the West End's only grocery stores is expected to reopen Wednesday — a relief for community members and political leaders who'd expressed heartbreak and anger about the destruction. Video captured the looting and gunfire early Tuesday at the Kroger near Dino's Food Mart at 26th and West Broadway, where peaceful protests had otherwise taken place throughout Monday over the death of David McAtee. People were seen in a widely shared video entering a side door of the Kroger, 2710 W. Broadway, and running back out with shopping carts full of items. Video also showed a group pulling money from a nearby Chase Bank ATM while repeated rounds of gunfire are heard going off in the background. A security guard at the Kroger said the inside pharmacy, beer aisle and baby supply aisle had been raided, with much of the food left untouched. The latest: Police release video they say shows McAtee shooting at officers In a press briefing, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said criminal acts such as what happened at the store ""submerge the whole purpose of peaceful protests"" in the names of McAtee and Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her apartment in March. ""There are criminals exploiting this occasion of sincere protest to create destruction and to steal from a business that so many community members rely on for their most basic needs,"" he said. ""So come on, folks. We're better than this."" Fischer said he spoke Tuesday with Kroger representatives, who said damage at the store could be repaired. ""You can fix a walk-in cooler, you can fix a piece of glass,"" he said. ""... But the most poignant thing to me that they shared was when they pulled up this morning, there were members of the community sweeping up glass on the sidewalk. That's what we are as a community."" Kroger spokeswoman Erin Grant said the Cincinnati-based grocer decided to close the Broadway store earlier Monday out of ""an abundance of caution."" Grant later said the store was reopening about 8 a.m. Wednesday, with plans to stay open until 4 p.m. The pharmacy and fuel center will reopen by the end of the week, Grant said, adding that the store will ""look to get back to normal operations as soon as possible."" ""We are saddened by the events of last night, but are thankful that none of our associates or customers were injured during the incident,"" Grant said in a statement. ""We all have a responsibility to speak out against racism and injustice when and where we see it,"" she said. ""But what’s more, we have a responsibility to more fully examine ourselves and to engage one another with greater compassion and deeper listening."" ""We will do our part to bring our community together, as an employer, grocery provider and community partner. We hope that the protests unfolding in Louisville and across the nation will peacefully shine a light on injustice."" Recap: What happened at Monday's David McAtee and Breonna Taylor protests Jackie Floyd, a community leader who lives in Russell, which is served by the Kroger, called the store a ""mainstay in the community,"" not just for food but for socializing among friends. It's one of three full-service grocery stores in western Louisville's nine neighborhoods, which are predominantly designated food deserts, where residents do not have adequate access to healthy, affordable food. Floyd said Tuesday she was concerned that the actions of a few could reduce that number to two. ""My neighbors that don't have a car, that are income challenged, they depend on this Kroger,"" she said. ""... Now that it's gone, now that it's closed, what now?"" Pastor Jeff Johnson of Revelation Tabernacle in New Albany said he grew up in the West End and knows that the Kroger ""is a hub of food and sustenance for tens of thousands of people in this area."" ""People get their prescriptions here,"" Johnson said. ""... There's a lot of elderly people, they can't go out to the South End or to the East End to get their food."" Floyd said she and other community leaders scrambled Tuesday morning to figure out how people in the Russell and California neighborhoods can get food and medicine while it was closed. Lenise Bell said she showed up to the store to see how she could assist. She has a car and posted on social media that she was willing to drive anyone who had to transfer their prescription elsewhere. ""A whole lot of people have reached out saying they're willing to help out as well,"" she said. ""... I'm blessed enough to have transportation to be able to assist with that, and I'll do whatever I can.""

The store was vandalized and looted overnight. Seymore wants the store reopened so that the area population can get essential supplies and prescriptions. (Photo: Michael Clevenger/Courier Journal) TARC also announced it was partnering with Kroger to operate a free and temporary ""bridge service"" from the shuttered Broadway location to the nearest store at 520 N. 35th St. in Portland. The TARC bus service began at noon Tuesday and will run every 30 minutes, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., until the Broadway store reopens. But while many have offered to help, Floyd and others said they were still fighting back anger over why the store wasn't protected. A security guard told WLKY that it took police officers about 45 minutes to respond to the store. ""They should have known that it was coming,"" Floyd said of the police. ""… I talked to another neighbor yesterday, and we were concerned about Kroger. How come others were not concerned about Kroger and didn't try to protect Kroger?"" On Monday, Fischer said the National Guard had been asked to stay out of the West End to tamp down hostilities that arose following McAtee's death — though several troops arrived at Dino's Food Mart just before 11 p.m. in response to a fire on the roof. Fischer later said their arrival at the fire was a mistake. Roughly 24 hours before the looting was seen taking place, police fatally shot McAtee while responding to a ""large"" group that had gathered outside Dino's. Now-former LMPD Chief Steve Conrad said someone in that crowd fired at the law enforcement personnel, who returned fire and shot McAtee, the owner of a popular West End barbecue business. LMPD released video footage Tuesday that the department said shows McAtee shooting a gun before officers and National Guard troops return fire. CLOSE Louisville police released additional footage Tuesday following the fatal shooting of David McAtee, which they say shows McAtee firing a gun first. Louisville Courier Journal Related: Investigation begins into fatal shooting of David McAtee But McAtee's mother, who mourned Monday at the scene of the fatal shooting where her 53-year-old son's body remained for hours, said he was a ""community pillar"" who ""didn't hurt nobody."" Gov. Andy Beshear has ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the shooting. Before the looting at the Kroger early Tuesday and a brief fire outside Dino's late Monday, the daylong protests at 26th Street and Broadway were otherwise peaceful. Fischer, who came to Dino's earlier in the day to talk with and apologize to McAtee's family, said the daylong protest was ""incredible"" to see. The mayor noted the powerful moment when one woman sang ""Amazing Grace"" to a silent crowd of mourners. Reach Billy Kobin at bkobin@courierjournal.com or 502-582-7030.

1623214488,2020-06-02 07:44:04,Experts warn large protests may 'become breeding grounds' for the coronavirus,http://rssfeeds.cincinnati.com/~/625788132/0/cincinnati-home~Experts-warn-large-protests-may-become-breeding-grounds-for-the-coronavirus/,en,False,,82890,nky.cincinnati.com,http://nky.cincinnati.com/#spider,"Public health officials warn new cases of COVID-19 probably will emerge after mass gatherings fueled by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and racial unrest in cities across America. Health experts fear carriers of coronavirus, which causes the disease, with no symptoms could unwittingly infect others at protests where social distancing is simply not taking place. The merits of the protesters' cause ""doesn’t prevent them from getting the virus,” said Bradley Pollock, chairman of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of California, Davis. At least one protester in Tampa, Florida, is known to have COVID-19. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who expressed dismay last week about Floyd's death, tweeted Monday that five of his officers were exposed to the protester, whom he did not identify. Protesting – especially without a mask – can put people at higher risk for infection, said Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. ""There's no doubt in my mind that these can become breeding grounds for this virus,"" he said during a Monday media availability. ""I would not be surprised to see in the next couple of weeks that we see increases that may be linked to protests."" Timeline: George Floyd protests: How did we get here? The human toll: 19 captivating images from this week's protests As businesses reopen, it will be difficult to figure out whether someone caught the virus at a protest or in some other encounter, Mina said. Hopefully, the fact that protests are taking place out of doors, will dilute the virus and reduce disease transmission, he said. Wearing a mask will help reduce infections, though it won't completely eliminate risk. ""If there's a floridly positive person who is coughing and spending a whole day around a lot of other people, that person might very well get other people sick despite having a mask on,"" Mina added, but ""there's a good chance that even homemade masks will actually do quite a bit to help people not get infected and not transmit."" There is a historical precedent to suggest viruses can be spread by large public gatherings. In September 1918, people in Philadelphia held a parade to support the war bond drive during World War I. The gathering of 200,000 people, crammed shoulder to shoulder, reignited a deadly flu epidemic, leading to massive closures and thousands of deaths, records show. ""Obviously, that was the exact wrong time to have a parade in hindsight,"" said J. Alexander Navarro, assistant director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan. Navarro said he's concerned if there's a second wave of infections, we will face the same problem they did in 1918, when public support was lacking to shut down businesses a second time, leading to more deaths. But former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden said pandemic responses, ""should never be used as social control."" ""The science is clear. Outdoors is far, far less risky than indoors,"" said Frieden, who added wearing a mask further reduces risk. ""Trust in government is crucial for effective public health programs. Our leaders must earn and maintain that trust – lack of trust is the biggest threat to health and progress fighting the pandemic."" There's also a public health cost to not protesting the status quo, said Dr. Hillary Babcock, an infectious disease specialist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and immediate past president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. ""Systemic racism also causes large public health impacts and public health risks for large portions of our population,"" Babcock said. She disagreed with calls for protesters to stay home to avoid fueling the outbreak. ""I don't think using public health as a reason to discourage protests after these events is really appropriate,"" Babcock said. ""It's a little disingenuous to say that the health risk from protesting is somehow bigger than the health risk at Lake of Ozarks (where people gathered for fun over Memorial Day weekend) or the practices that brought us to this point in the first place."" ‘You could see the train wreck coming’: Inexperienced, dubious companies among many aiming to cash in on coronavirus antibody tests At least one reveler at the Ozarks party tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Camden County Health Department. Others were advised to monitor for symptoms. Babcock said it is possible to minimize the risks of protesting, with masks, social distancing and asking sick people to stay home. Arresting people and putting them into close contact with others increases risk, Babcock said, as does spraying protesters with pepper spray, which causes violent coughing and can potentially spread the virus. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency room physician and former Baltimore health commissioner, said there is risk of longer-term effects in communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Wen was Baltimore's health commissioner when protests erupted following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. The death triggered civil unrest in communities already burdened with deep-seated inequities, she said. ""When over a dozen pharmacies burned down and closed and stores were looted, it was community members themselves who were affected the most,"" Wen said. While protests over the past week following Floyd's death have highlighted police-community relations, demonstrators are also calling attention to social justice issues, including health disparities. ""The same communities that are already the most affected are potentially going to have an increase in the number of cases as a result of people gathering,"" Wen said. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said anger in the black community has been building for years. Floyd's death spurred them to take to the streets, even as the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on African Americans. ""Black people are risking their lives protesting in the middle of a pandemic that’s killing black folks. That’s real,"" she said. ""There is no convenient time to fight back."" Resources and ways to donate:How you can take action from home after the death of George FloydMeanwhile, state and local public health agencies plan to monitor for new COVID-19 cases. Any large gathering during a pandemic is a concern, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the Massachusetts Covid Response project. Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit, handles Massachusetts’ contact tracing of individuals infected with or exposed to the virus. Following such a large gathering, potential cases need to be monitored over two weeks, the virus’s incubation period. “The epidemic curve should guide the response and the phased reopening of society,"" Welch said. ""Until the epidemic is declared over, social distancing and wearing masks should remain the new normal."" Peter Pitts, president and co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a nonpartisan research and educational organization, said he worries COVID-19 will take advantage of people gathering to protest police violence. ""Social distancing and social conflict are a very potent negative combination when it comes to spreading a virus,"" he said. ""The timing is highly unfortunate."" Public health concerns, which are usually complicated, can easily be drowned out by other ""sexier"" stories, he said, citing the recent SpaceX launch. But the virus ""doesn't cease to be a real threat because of other threats happening simultaneously,"" he said. ""That means we have to twice as smart and twice as dedicated and twice as focused.""",0.0

Video shot by Dennis Nett for Syracuse.com shows Nett being pushed by a police officer who was part of a line of officers in riot gear advancing on protesters in a different direction. In the video, Nett is seen being ordered to move back before an officer breaks rank and charges him, shoving him to the ground. ""Move back! Move back!"" various officers are heard yelling in the video before Nett is shoved. ADVERTISEMENT Officials with Advance Media New York, owners of two media organizations for which Nett has worked for decades, slammed his treatment at the hands of Syracuse police in a statement. “The community relies on journalists like Dennis to document what’s happening in breaking news situations like the protests on Saturday night,” said Trish LaMonte, the company's vice president of content. “He was just doing the job he has every right to do when he was physically and unjustifiably attacked by an officer. It’s troubling behavior, and city officials need to assure us it will not be tolerated.” Police officials said in a statement that the incident would be investigated, while noting that the department typically works to allow media access to news events when possible. ""The chief’s office has been made aware of a video that has surfaced that appears to show physical contact between SPD and a reporter from syracuse.com from the violent protests on Saturday night,'' police chief Kenton Buckner told Syracuse.com in an email. ""We are in the process of reviewing the incident. As a practice, SPD has always tried to provide reasonable access to media to do their jobs when appropriate.'' One witness told the news site that Nett appeared to be shoved particularly hard by the officer. “He pushed him really hard,’’ Clifford Ryans, a local anti-violence activist, told Syracuse.com. “He hit the ground pretty hard, like you know when you shove someone off your feet.” ADVERTISEMENT Journalists across the country have reported injuries or arrests at the hands of officers while covering the protests over the death of George Floyd, a black Minneapolis man who died in police custody after video showed an officer kneeling on his neck for several minutes. CNN's Omar Jimenez was arrested live on-air during a news report and later released. Police later contended on Twitter that Jimenez and two other CNN journalists were released after they were identified as members of the news media, while CNN said in a statement that the three clearly identified themselves prior to their arrests. ""Our CNN crew identified themselves, on live television, immediately as journalists,"" CNN said in a tweet.

""I believe some coward randomly shot at the police line."" ST. LOUIS — Four St. Louis police officers were shot and injured during violent protests in the city Monday night and into early Tuesday morning. Two of the officers were shot in the leg, one was shot in the foot and the fourth officer was shot in the arm, St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden told reporters outside a hospital at about 2 a.m. Tuesday. The four officers include a 52-year-old man with 30 years of service, a 34-year-old man with 12 years of service, a 36-year-old man with three years of service and a 28-year-old man with one year of service. Hayden said all of the officers have been released from the hospital. “I believe some coward randomly shot at the police line,” Chief Hayden said giving an impassioned update. He said at this time, police have no suspects and no descriptions of the person or persons who shot the officers. Hayden said the officers were standing off to the side of the police line when they suddenly felt pain. “Thankfully, thank God they’re alive,” the police chief said holding back tears. “Can we make some sense out of this? That’s all I’m trying to say.” A large peaceful protest moved in and around the downtown area until about 8 p.m. Hayden said a much smaller group of about 200 people changed the mood. “They obviously had no intention on protesting or doing anything constructive,” Chief Hayden said. He said the rioters were hyping up the crowd, high fiving each other and flashing pistols. He said they started throwing things at officers and then looting all over downtown. Hayden said officers working to control the agitators had fireworks thrown at them – with some of those exploding on officers – they also had bottles and rocks thrown at them and gas poured on them. “Officers exhibited extraordinary restraint,” Hayden said, explaining that officers only took measures on the crowd when things got violent outside police headquarters at about 9 p.m. Police in riot gear threw tear gas at the crowd and started moving in lines to break up the rioters. “There’s a pit in my stomach. I’m stunned. We need to pray for our city and pray for these officers,” Chief Hayden said. Violent riots were still happening in the city into the early morning hours Tuesday. “Officers are still taking gunfire downtown,"" Woodling said in her email update to the media just before 1 a.m. ""As we speak, we’re trying to get control of the city. Still hearing gunfire and everything,"" Chief Hayden said during his update at about 2 a.m. Police said the officers were shot somewhere between 15th and 16th streets at Olive. That's about four blocks from police headquarters. Police remained stationed throughout the larger downtown area, including at Olive and Jefferson, as seen in the photo below. Peaceful protests give way to looting, fires and violence near downtown St. Louis Protests over the death of George Floyd in downtown St. Louis started peaceful Monday — and continued that way for five hours with a crowd of about 1,000 people. But as the sun set, a small group of agitators began getting violent toward police. Over a few hours with a couple dozen rioters, a 7-Eleven burned, at least one police car was damaged and fireworks were thrown at officers. The mood shifted downtown at about 8 p.m. At about 8:30 p.m., police were seen running out of police headquarters to form a line on Olive Street as a small group of protesters walked up to the building. Rioters threw several fireworks at police officers, with some of them going off within feet of officers. At about 8:55 p.m., police threw several tear gas canisters into the crowd. Protesters quickly scattered throughout the streets in downtown. 5 On Your Side's Jenna Barnes was in the area at the time. She reported hearing police warn the crowd using a loudspeaker that if they did not leave the area, tear gas would be used. Then by 9:30 p.m., rioters had made their way down to a 7-Eleven store at 17th and Pine. Sky5's camera showed the store's windows had been busted and looters were running out of the business with items in their hands. A rioter was seen throwing a firework into the building. It exploded and then moments later, smoke started billowing out. Flames quickly spread inside the business as rioters ran away from the area. Firefighters arrived and put out the fire. They also responded to a small fire in the middle of the street a couple blocks away from the 7-Eleven. About a block away from the 7-Eleven, a couple dozen protesters were seen standing in front of a line of police officers who were blocking the street. The officers are elbow-to-elbow in a line across the street while wearing full riot gear. Police continued to hold the line and pushed toward the crowd to get them to break up. 'Can we make some sense out of this?' | Emotional police chief pleads for answers after 4 officers shot in St. Louis St. Louis’ top cop got emotional while searching for answers about the violence that’s hitting the city and communities around the country following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. “There’s a pit in my stomach. I’m stunned. We need to pray for our city and pray for these officers,” Chief John Hayden said early Tuesday morning. Four St. Louis police officers were shot while working during protests that turned into riots Monday night. All four are expected to survive. “Some coward fired shots at officers and now we have four in the hospital. But thankfully, thank God they’re alive, “ Chief Hayden said, getting choked up and holding back tears. “Can we make some sense out of this?"" he pleaded. ""That’s all I’m trying to say.” Hayden described the agitators who turned a peaceful protest violent as “crazy people” who were hyping up the crowd. He said they threw rocks, bottles, fireworks and gas at officers. “I don’t understand what that has to do with Mr. Floyd’s death,” the police chief said, exasperated. “Mr. Floyd’s death is tragic. But can we make something out of these kids coming down here and just started like crazy, jumping up and down, high fiving each other, flourishing pistols. I don’t know what else to say. This is horrible.” Hayden said that smaller crowds of agitators had no intention of doing anything constructive, unlike the much larger peaceful crowd that marched through the downtown St. Louis area earlier Monday. “What does stealing have to do with any of this? Folks came down there just to steal, just to destroy property and just to hurt officers. That was the purpose of them coming. I’m not processing that,” he said. Looters smashed out the windows of a 7-Eleven near 17th and Pine, just a couple blocks from where the officers were shot. One rioter threw a firework into the convenience store and moments later smoke started billowing out of the business. Within seconds, the store was on fire. “I can’t describe my emotions. I just know I don’t understand what’s going on. Innocent officers being shot at,” he said to reporters. Statement from Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) ""The police officer shootings in St. Louis overnight are despicable. My prayers go out to the officers and their families. And my heartfelt thanks goes to them as well. These officers, and thousands more around our state, choose to put their lives on the line every day, and every night, to protect the neighborhoods we call home. The perpetrators who attacked them last night must be brought to justice. And we must bring order to our cities and towns now. Violence threatens to destroy the fabric of our communities and undermine our ability to live and act together. Every American has a right to assemble and protest peaceably, but mindless violence is not protest, it is further injustice that harms us all.""",0.0

Demond Haynes, 20, was charged with murder, possessing a handgun as a convicted felon, possession of a controlled substance and possession of marijuana, according to online court records. Officers with the Louisville Metro Police Department's Fourth Division responded about 7:10 p.m. Sunday to Seventh and Hill streets on a possible shooting and found a female victim inside of a vehicle with a gunshot wound to her back, an arrest citation states. Demond Haynes (Photo: Louisville Metro Corrections) The victim was taken to University of Louisville Hospital, where she died from her injuries, according to the arrest citation. The Jefferson County Coroner's Office later identified the victim as Karleigh Miller, 19, and said she died at 7:37 p.m. Sunday from a gunshot wound.

Still, we can't breathe. CLOSE Police used gas to clear protesters from Lafayette Park before President Donald Trump walked over and held a Bible up at St. John's Episcopal Church. USA TODAY America’s day from hell happened Monday, everywhere from Washington to Los Angeles with a stop in between in Cincinnati. Another chunk of the national soul fell to the pavement, right there by the empty tear gas canisters. If we cannot demonstrate peacefully in this country, we have lost the very center of our existence. Just before 7 p.m. Monday night, the president offered a speech in the Rose Garden of the White House, in which he said he supported peaceful protest. As he spoke, “flash-bang’’ explosions sounded from across the street and peaceful protesters poured water into their tear-gassed eyes. This was so a path could be cleared for the president to walk through Lafayette Square to St. John’s Episcopal Church, for a photo opportunity that featured him holding a Bible. Truth really is stranger than fiction. In Cincinnati, peaceful protest included an Enquirer reporter shoved to the ground and arrested by police. Pat Brennan was doing his job. He was wearing a mask and goggles (perfectly acceptable gear these days, in riots and out) and supposedly his media credential was not readily visible. The police apologized, the mayor apologized. It was a misunderstanding in an emotionally charged situation. Pat was released 30 minutes after his arrest. He was gracious about the whole thing. OK. What wasn’t OK was the sight of five to seven cops grabbing Pat and trying to slam his face into the street, followed by the police department tweeting out a statement that sounded like the world’s biggest shrug: “We apologize for any inconvenience.’’ Perhaps those protesting respectfully coast to coast should pick up on that written so-what the next time they exercise their right to gather. We apologize for any inconvenience. We have done this before. We are a nation of protesters. Our very existence owes to it. Boston Harbor to Selma, Alabama. This protest feels different. It looks different. White folks have joined black folks in demanding an end to police tactics such as those used to kill George Floyd in Minneapolis. I can’t breathe isn’t just a desperate cry for mercy from a dying man. It’s a metaphor for who we are in the spring of 2020. We can’t breathe. The tear gas choked us, but no more than the actions of the past week. They’ve taken away our collective breath. Sucked the oxygen and the optimism right from the air. On Monday, hopeful Americans believed the president would offer a message of conciliation and a plea for harmony. This isn’t us. We can do better, we must do better, we will do better. Optimists believed the president would demand police officers be better trained and restrained. He would promise to gather with leaders from all sides of the problem. What would result would be a plan for a more united state of America. He didn’t do that. He doesn’t have it in him. He reaffirmed his claim of being a “law and order president.’’ He said he’d send “thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers’’ to deal with looters. He used about a minute of his time to express condolences to George Floyd’s family. He spent the rest of his time saying armed forces of police and troops would “dominate’’ our streets. And still, we can’t breathe. Of course, looters should be dealt with. People who smashed the windows of a Chanel store wanted to steal a handbag, not further the cause of justice. We can have both, though. Justice and peace. What we can’t have is one without the other. Addressing the issue of violence against black people has to come first. Not “dominating’’ our streets. Unless you like the idea of living with Putin. The president strode from the White House to the church across the way, Bible in hand. The path had been cleared of peaceful protesters. Armored vehicles were evident. Armored vehicles against peaceful demonstrators. The president walked with the confidence of a king. Optimists thought, “Maybe he’ll do it now. Maybe he’s using the symbolism of a house of worship to urge us to come together and be the country we can be. He will use his power to be the leader he can be.’’ But the president would not stand on the steps of St. John’s Episcopal to urge mutual love and respect. He had no interest in delivering a message of empathy or strength that required a force of character, not a force of men aiming weapons at their fellow citizens. Promising to heed the words of the book he held in his left hand was not going to be the president’s point. The president’s point was to have his picture taken. Empty symbolism in dire circumstances. And still, we can’t breathe.

Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George floors last words, but they didn't die with him. You're still being heard going all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often, just the color of your skin put your life at risk. They speak to the nation were more than 100,000 people have lost their lives a virus and 40 million have filed for unemployment. With the disproportionate number of those deaths and job losses concentrated black and brown communities, they speak to a nation where every day millions of people and millions not at the moment of losing their life but in the course of living their life are saying to themselves, I can't breathe. It's a wake up call to our nation. In my view, it's for all of us, and I mean all of us. It's not the first time we've heard those words. They're the same words we heard from Eric Garner when his life was taken away six years ago. But it's time to listen to those words, to try to understand, to respond to him respond with action. A country is crying out for leadership leadership that can you. Nine US leadership That brings us together. Leadership that could recognize pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on the neck for a long time. There's no place for violence, no place for looting or destroying property or burning churches. There's during businesses. Many have been built by the very people of color who are first time in their lives, are beginning to realize their dreams and bill wealth for their families. Nor is it acceptable for police sworn to protect and serve all people escalate tension, resort to excessive violence, way need to distinguish between legitimate peaceful protests and opportunistic, violent destruction. We have to be vigilant about the violence that's being done by this incumbent president, to our economy and to the pursuit of justice. Would peaceful protesters dispersed in order for a president, a president from the doorstep of the People's House, the White House, using tear gas and flash grenades in order to stage a photo op? A photo of one of the most historic churches in the country, or at least in Washington, D. C. We can be forgiven for believing the president's more interesting in power, then in principle were just serving the passions of his based on the needs of the people in his care, for that's what the presidency is, the duty to care, to care for all of us, not just those who vote for us, but all of us, not just our donors, but all of us. The president held up the Bible at ST John's Church. I just wish he opened it once in a while, said a brandishing. If he opened it, he could have learned something. They're all called love one another as we love ourselves. It's really hard work, but it's the work of America. Donald Trump is interested in doing that work. Instead, he's preening and sweeping away all the guard rails. Lo have protected our democracy guard rails. I helped make possible this nation's path to a more perfect union, a union that constantly requires reform and rededication. And, yes, the protest from voices that are mistreated, ignored, left out or left behind. But it is a union you worth fighting for. That's why I'm running for pressure. In addition of the Bible, the president might also want open the U. S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find a thing called the First Amendment What it says, Beginning says the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition their government for redress of grievances. That's kind of an essential motion building into this country, Mr President. That's America. That's America. No horses rising up on their hind legs to push back peaceful protests, not using the American military to move against the American people. This is a nation of values. Our freedom to speak is a cherished knowledge that lives inside every American. Almost from the time your kids we're gonna allow any president to quiet our voice. We won't let those who see this is an opportunity to sow chaos. Throw up a smokescreen to distract us and very really religion legitimate grievances. At the heart of these protests, we can We can't leave this moment. I can't leave this moment thinking that we can once again turn away and do nothing. Can't do that this time. We just can't. The moment has come for our nation to deal with systemic graces to deal with the growing economic inequity that exists in our nation to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation made to so many. No, I've said from the outset of this election that were in the battle for the soul of this nation. We are in the battle for the soul of a nation. What we believe, maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It's all steak that's sure today than it's ever been leased in my lifetime. And it's this urgent. It's in the services we can find a path forward. Now the history of this nation teaches us that is some of our darkest moments of despair. We've made some of our greatest progress somewhere. Darkest moment. 13 14 15th Amendments follow the Civil War The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 65. Voting Rights Act of 65 came in the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs. Prior phrase Reverend Barber. It's the morning we find hope. It's in the morning. We find hope when we more it's gonna take more than talk. Had talked before, read protest before we've got a now vowed to make this at least in their of action and reverse the systemic racism with a long overdue concrete changes. The action will not be completed in the 1st 100 days of my presidency. If I'm fortunate to be elected or even in my entire term, it's gonna take the work of a generation. But if this agenda will take time to complete, it should not wait for the 1st 100 days of my presidency to get started. A down payment, What is long overdue should come now should come immediately. I call in the Congress to act this month on measures that would be the first step in this direction, starting with real police reform. Congressman Jeffries has a bill to outlaw. Joe calls. Congress should put it on the president's desk in the next few days. The other measures to stop transferring weapons of war to police forces improve oversight and accountability to create a model use of force standard that also should be made long this month. No more excuses, no delays. If Mitch McConnell can bring in the United States Senate to confirm Trump's on qualified judicial nominees who will run roughshod over our constitution now it's time to pass legislation will give true meaning to our constitutional promise of equal protection under the law. Looking ahead, in the 1st 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight Commission. I've long believed we need riel community policing. We need each and every police Department of Country to understand a comprehensive review of the undertaking conference review of their hiring, their training de escalation. Some have already done it somehow are in the process of doing it. The federal government should give give the cities and states the tools and the resources they need to implement reforms. More police officers meet the higher standards of the procession. Most of them do it all. The more reason why bad cops should be dealt with severely and swiftly. We all need to take a hard look at the culture allows for the senseless tragedies to keep happening. We need to learn from the cities in the precincts that are getting it right. We know though we have in order to have true American justice, we need economic justice as well. Here, too, is there's much to be done. As a media step. Congress should act should act now to rectify racial inequities that allow Cove in 19 recovery funds to be diverted from where they live. I'll be setting forth my Jenna and economic justice and opportunity in the weeks and months ahead. But it begins with health care. Health care should be a right, not a privilege of the quickest route to universal coverage of this country's expand on Obama care. We could do it. We should do it. But this president, even now in the midst of a public health crisis with massive unemployment, well want to destroy it. He doesn't care how many millions Americans will be hurt because he's consumed with his blind. Any go when it comes to Barack Obama. President Obama. The presidency would draw his lawsuit to strike down Obamacare, and the Congress should prepare to pass the act. I proposed to expand Obama care to millions Mawr. So everyone's covered his last words. We've seen America's true heroes health care workers, docks, nurses, delivery truck drivers, grocery store workers. You know, we've come up with new phrase from essential workers. Essential worker way need to do more than praise them. We need to pay them. We need to pay them because we weren't clear before. It's clear now. This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs was built by the great American middle class, which is built by unions and are essential workers. You know, I know there's enormous fear and uncertainty and anger in the country. I understand. I know so many Americans are suffering, suffering, loss of a loved one. So for an economic hardship, wondering, can I feed my family tomorrow? What's gonna have suffering under the weight of a generation after generation after generation, I've heard inflicted on people of color black brown in native communities in particular. Like many of you, I know what it means. Degree. My losses are not the same as loss is felt by so many. But I know what it feels like when you think you can't go on. I know what it means to have that black hole in your chest where your grief is being sucked into it. Just a few days ago, mark the fifth anniversary of my son most passing. There are still moments when the pain is so great it feels no different than the day I sat in that bed as he passed away. But I also knew, but the best way to bear loss and pain to turn it into that anger and anguish in the purpose. And Americans know what our purposes is a nation. It has to be guided. Mr. Guided guided us from the very beginning. No, it's been reported the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Little Yolanda King came home from school in Atlanta and jumped in her daddy's arms, said, Oh, Daddy, she said, Now we're never going to get our freedom. Daddy was reassuring, Strong, brave. He said, No, don't worry, baby. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Amid the violence and fear, Dr King persevered. He was driven by his dream of a nation where justice runs down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream. Then 19 68. Hate cut him down in Memphis two days before Dr Key was murdered. Hey gave a final Sunday sermon to Washington. No, he told us that though the arc of the moral universe is long said, it bends towards justice and we know we can bend it because we have. We have to believe that still, that's our purpose. It's been our purpose in the very beginning, to become a nation where all men and women are not only creating, but they're treated equally, not just credited, would treated equally to become a nation to find, in Dr King's words, not only by the absence of tension before the presence of justice, I'm not just a not attention but justice. Today in America, it's hard to keep faith the justices hated. I know that, you know pain is raw, the pain is really president of states must be part of the solution, not the problem. But this president today is part of the problem and accelerates. When you treated the words when the looting starts, the shooting starts. They weren't the words present. Their words of a racist Miami police chief in the sixties when he tweeted the protesters quote, would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs when people would have been really hurt. End of quote. They weren't the words of a president. They were the kind of words Bull Connor would have used, unleashing his dogs on innocent women and Children. You know, the American story is a story about action and reaction that's actually works. We can't be naive about it. I wish I could say that Hate began with Donald Trump will. And with him it didn't and it won't. American history is in a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we're all created equal in the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. The honest truth is that both elements are part of the American character, both elements at our best. The American ideal wins out, but it's never around. It's always a fight, and the battle is never fully one. But we can't ignore the truth that we're at our best when we open our hearts rather than clinch our fish. Donald Trump has turned this country in a battlefield driven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him. His narcissism has become more important than the nation's well being that he leads. I ask every American I mean this in the bottom, or ask every American look at where we are now and thinking new. Is this who we are? Is this what we want to be? Is this you want to pass on to our Children and our grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather the pursuit of happiness, incompetence and anxiety, self absorbed selfishness? Or do we want to be the America we know? We can be American. We know in our hearts we could be and should be. Look, I look at the presidency as a very big job and nobody we'll get it right every time. And I won't either. But I promise you this. I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek the heal, the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not used them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I'll never forget. I will never forget. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us work now gone to rebuild the nation, but build it better than it was. We're the only nation of the world that goes through a crisis and comes out better to build a better future That's what America does to build a better future. We build the future. It may in fact, be the most American thing to do. Build the future. We hunger for liberty the way Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass did. We thirst for the vote like Susan B. Anthony and Ella Baker and John Lewis. Did we strive to explore the stars, cure disease, make an in perfect union more perfect than has been? We may come up short, but at our best we try. My fellow Americans were facing a formidable enemies. They include not only the Corona virus and the table impact on the lives and livelihoods, but also the selfishness and fear that have loomed over our national life for the last three years. I choose those words advisedly, selfishness and fear. Defeating those enemies requires us to do our duty, and that duty includes remembering who we should be, who we should be. We should be the America of F. D. R. And Eisenhower of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. Jonah Salt. Neil Armstrong. We should be the America that cherishes life, liberty and courage, and above all, we should be in America that chairs each other each and every one of us. You know, we're a nation in pain. We must let let our pain destroys. We're nation and raged. We can not our rage consume us. We're a nation. It's exhausted. But we will not allow our exhaustion to fetus as presidents. My commitment to all of you to lead on these issues and to listen because I truly believe in my heart of hearts we can't overcome. We stand together. Finally, is one America. We'll rise stronger than we were before. We'll move that art closer to justice. We'll reach out to one another for speak out for one another. And please, please do what's recently been happening. Take care of one another. This is the United States of America. There's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it. We've done it together together, united. That's we are at our best. God bless you all. May God protect our troops que Mr Mayor. Thanks for hospitality. Teoh. All the elected officials that air here bring ingredients. I can't breathe.

1623376587,2020-06-02 11:02:16,Downtown Chaos and West End Memoriam On Fifth Night Of Louisville Protests,https://www.wkyufm.org/post/downtown-chaos-and-west-end-memoriam-fifth-night-louisville-protests,en,False,,35248,wkyufm.org,http://wkyufm.org#spider,"The fifth consecutive day of protests against police violence in Louisville featured two gatherings: one, a demonstration at Jefferson Square Downtown, and another at 26th and Broadway, where a barbecue chef was shot and killed early Monday morning. More than a thousand protesters gathered at Jefferson Square Park to demonstrate in the wake of the deaths of Breonna Taylor, who was killed by Louisville Metro Police in March, and David McAtee, who died at the hands of LMPD and the National Guard early Monday morning. Hear the audio version of Ryland's story. Protesters knelt in a moment of solidarity before marching down Sixth Street to Broadway, where they turned west and headed for Yaya’s BBQ, the site where he was gunned down by authorities less than 24 hours earlier. Cynthia Ganote, a white woman, says she was marching to show solidarity with people of color. She said she feels her place is to show up, listen and act. “It is not up to those who are constantly being oppressed to figure out how to end systemic oppression,” Ganote said. Verona Hardimon, a Black woman whose family lives in the West End, says she heard the commotion and decided to see the protests for herself, with her granddaughter and her son. She commented on the many white faces joining in the march. “I think that’s what it’s going to take — white people standing up for what’s wrong and how we’ve been treated for years. I really do, I love it,” Hardimon said. Once the march reached the site where McAtee died, most demonstrators turned around and walked back toward downtown. There were already hundreds more gathered there. After the march, a few hundred of the protesters returned to downtown. Up until this point, the police presence had been much less noticeable than in recent days. But around 10 p.m., things changed. Mayor Greg Fischer said police broke up the protest because shots were fired. WFPL’s Ryan Van Velzer did not hear gunshots, but that doesn’t mean they didn’t happen. It was a chaotic scene. Police began firing teargas, flash bangs and pepper balls. Two police lines formed and marched on protesters, at one point firing tear gas behind them, forcing them to run through it. Officers also appeared on rooftops and fired non-lethal deterrents down on small clusters of protesters after clearing Jefferson Square Park. Here’s what one protester, Christina, saw: “When we got here there were people running down the streets crying because they got shot with teargas, one girl was running down the street screaming I can’t see, I can’t see, I can’t see.” Within a half hour, police seem to have retaken downtown. Twenty blocks west — police were nowhere to be seen for much of the evening. Shortly after 8 p.m., more than a thousand people were crowded at the intersection of 26th and Broadway. They carried signs and honked horns, they embraced and shared tales of McAtee. The night was less protest and more celebration of sorts for McAtee — known around here as Yaya. “Ain’t nobody else can barbecue better than him, no chef can tear up in the kitchen better than him. None of that, this block isn’t going to be nothing without Yaya, they done destroyed a legend, for nothing,” said a young man who goes by Snow. Snow spent lots of time in McAtee’s shop — and like many other here had never ending stories about McAtee’s generosity, his presence and the gaping hole his death leaves. “No lie, there is no 26 without YaYa,” he said. McAtee was known for his barbecue. He owned a small restaurant here at this intersection and fed passersby, police and anyone who needed a bite to eat — he would leave meat on the grill at night for homeless, he’d happily hand over a hotdog even if you were short on cash. He was killed in a barrage of bullets fired by police and the National Guard. His brother, Marvin McAtee, said when the police and soldiers arrived they began firing non-lethal pepper balls, and Yaya was reaching out the door of the shop to grab a cousin and pull him inside when he caught a bullet in his chest — a real bullet. “It’s the most terrible loss I’ve ever had in my life, and I’ve had losses. He was my mentor, my rock, didn’t nobody ride for me in my family like he did. It’s a terrible loss,” he said. Marvin is co-owner of the barbecue shop and says he plans to honor his brother’s legacy — cooking food and playing music. “Old school music, their young music, all the way the people like. He’s a good man, he’s a good man,” Marvin said. As the night wore on and the imposed curfew of 9 p.m. came and went, no police had shown up — but people wondered constantly if they would. And if they did… what would happen. The night was incredibly peaceful — but just before 11 p.m., a fire broke out atop Dino’s Food Mart, a convenience store right at the intersection. Firefighters showed up; police and the National Guard were right behind them. For less than an hour, the police and soldiers monitored the scene, some with rifles, some without. People stood on the sidewalks filming, wondering how the night would end. They got their answer shortly after the flames were extinguished. The Humvees pulled away and police were soon to follow. Cheers erupted from the crowd and the night carried on. The only thing missing was Yaya’s barbecue.",0.0

James Manni said. “These were not protesters. This was an intentional, coordinated attack on the city.""Police received intelligence several hours prior to the violence that people were coming from out of state armed with crow bars, flares and gasoline, Manni said.Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza on Tuesday morning said five of the people arrested were from out of state.Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven M. Paré said Tuesday that none of the hurt officers was seriously injured.The trouble started at around midnight when a crowd of 300 to 500 people gathered in the street outside the Providence Place mall, police said. At about 2 a.m. police deployed tear gas to disperse the crowd, but fireworks and sirens continued to be heard in the city for hours, according to media reports.At one point several people broke into the mall, and Manni thinks they intended to set it on fire.Manni and Elorza say the damage could have been much worse had the police not been prepared.“Last night’s incidents were devastating for our community who has already experienced so much unrest and pain,"" Elorza said in a statement. “Violence is never the answer and we need collective action - one that is productive, not destruction of our small businesses, who have been impacted so much already and by putting others safety at risk.""The mall, which reopened for the first time Monday since being closed in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic, was closed Tuesday, according to its website.",0.0

THERE’S NOTHING Advertisement Death toll grows in national protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Amid protests seeking justice for a black man killed after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck, several people have lost their lives. They include a well-known and popular owner of a barbecue spot in Louisville, Kentucky and a federal officer working security at a courthouse in Oakland. Many of these deaths have gone unnoticed, overshadowed by the turmoil roiling American cities.One man was the beloved owner of a Louisville barbecue restaurant who made sure to provide free meals to officers. Another was a man known as ""Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest.They are among the people who have been killed as protests roiled American cities in the week since 46-year-old George Floyd died when a white officer jammed his knee into the back of the black man's neck. The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of chaos engulfing cities across America, from heavy-handed riot police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism.Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black families to lose more members of their community amid the unrest.Dozens more have been hurt in various altercations — vehicles plowing into crowds, police officers suffering head injuries and broken bones and protesters ending up in emergency rooms with a variety of injuries from the melees.The death toll and circumstances surrounding the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know about the cases so far:LOUISVILLEAs local police and the National Guard sought to disperse a crowd early Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing the owner of a barbecue restaurant, David McAtee. The mayor has since terminated the city's police chief after finding out that officers on the scene did not activate their body cameras. The state police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating.The 53-year-old McAtee was an African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by.""We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. ""David was a friend to many, a well-known Barbecue man.""The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd's killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home.___OAKLANDA federal law enforcement officer was providing security at the federal courthouse in Oakland during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle.Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically injured in the shooting. It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building's glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti.Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers and employed by the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service; they were monitoring a nearby protest. No one has been arrested and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined. Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional district north of Los Angeles. ___INDIANAPOLISTwo people were killed over the weekend amid unrest in Indianapolis, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University.Beaty was known as ""Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after his graduation. He also was a prominent businessman in the city and ran multiple nightclubs.""I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,"" coach Tom Allen said in a statement. ""Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.""The circumstances of his shooting weren't immediately clear but some media reports said it happened near an apartment where he lived. It also occurred the same night that an 18-year-old man also was fatally shot as protests broke out in the city.___MINNEAPOLISIn what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, a 43-year-old black man was fatally shot outside a pawn shop as rioting broke out last week in Minneapolis and then spread nationally.The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Calvin L. Horton Jr. Police say they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood.The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during unrest. ___OMAHA, NEBRASKAA 22-year-old black man was killed after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two bars in downtown Omaha. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including James Scurlock, approach bar owner Jake Gardner.Two people are seen on the video tackling Gardner, who ended up on his back and fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen tackling Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock.Authorities have declined to press charges, calling the shooting self-defense.___DETROITA 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver's seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot.___CHICAGO SUBURBTwo people were killed during unrest Monday in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania did not provide details about those who were killed but said it happened amid protests there.",0.0

You say you're against police brutality; will you do something humble and kneel with us?' and I said, 'Absolutely,' and I did and several of my officers joined me,"" Isaac said.Isaac spoke during a briefing Monday on the protests over the weekend, saying he and none of his staff believe what took place in Minneapolis was right and know law enforcement is more professional than that.""We have to move past this and those that have not made those necessary changes, they need to do that as well. I'm very proud of the work our men and women are doing,"" Isaac said. Protests in Cincinnati were largely peaceful Monday, scattered across the city's urban core and were relatively quiet, at least when compared to days prior.The protests are in honor of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, was killed after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while taking him into custody in Minnesota.A number of groups have been holding peaceful rallies to get the true message of their moment out, highlighting what they say are racial injustices and police brutality across the country. Organizers are asking participants to respect social distancing guidelines, wear masks and keep in groups no larger than 10 people.The protests have been followed by three nights of unrest in the city, with vandalism and looting during the first two nights.Isaac said he understands people are angry and he shares that anger and wants to talk about it.""It's never too late to talk. I understand that people are angry if we're not going to talk what's going to happen then, is this going to go on indefinitely. Yeah we need to talk; we need to talk about how to make things better; we need to talk about more reform; we need to listen to what the community is saying, particularly our young people; that's most important to me,"" Isaac said.Ohio State Sen. Cecil Thomas said his hope is that the protests continue peacefully in order for the true message to be heard.""The peaceful protesters. They done what they wanted to do. Obviously, they honored the curfew,"" Thomas said. ""Now there are people out who may be attempting to do things similar to what happened last night and the night before.""",0.0

Louisville Courier Journal Since the first people began carrying signs and exhorting us to say Breonna Taylor’s name last week, Louisville has wrestled with what has unfolded on our downtown streets. We’ve seen protesting like we haven’t seen in more than 50 years. We’ve watched rioting and looting on our downtown streets. We’ve seen the death of yet another black man at the hands of police. What we haven’t seen is leadership. Where is Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer while all this is going on? He showed up for a few minutes Monday morning to offer his condolences to Odessa Riley, the grieving mother of David McAtee, who died early Monday when police and National Guardsmen returned fire into a crowd at 26th and Broadway. And then he left. Buy Photo Thousands marched on Broadway towards Louisville's West End to protest the killing of beloved BBQ chef David McAtee by gunfire early Monday from LMPD and Kentucky National Guard. Law enforcement engaged after claiming to be shot by a person in a group they were disbanding. June 1, 2020 (Photo: Matt Stone/Courier Journal) He’ll appear on a livestream soon from a secured bunker somewhere and then he’ll disappear. He might even call a late-night press conference when those who most need to hear from him are not at a television or computer where they can watch. They’ll be out dodging his police department's pepper balls and tear gas canisters — and God forbid, more bullets — then. (Oh, and he showed up at a protest at Jefferson Square on Tuesday evening, several hours after this column posted online.) In the five days since this all began, Fischer has been in hiding. Emerging only to spout a few platitudes and finally — years after he should have — fire his police chief. He’s been hunkered down and blaming the rioting and the protests on “outsiders” who have come to Louisville to raise hell and cause trouble. To do that, however, misses the real issue. We have a problem with race in this community. We have for years. Opinion: Looting is inexcusable. So is police brutality that has stolen hopes and dreams Louisville’s blacks and whites have had an uneasy truce that dates back to the civil rights battles of the 1960s. That truce is only occasionally broken when there’s a court ruling or a police policy or the death of a black person that brings the rawness of our city’s dirty little secret to the surface. For Robert Hollis, a 52-year-old who spent two decades in the Army and has called Louisville home for 10 years, blaming the current unrest on outsiders is insulting. “I look around and I know half of these people,” Hollis said while standing at the corner of 26th and Broadway during a protest Monday afternoon near the spot where McAtee died. Hollis was there trying to make sure things didn’t get too heated, intervening once when a young man heaved a water bottle at police wearing riot gear, and another time when a protester became angry with a news reporter. “What he’s saying when he says it’s ‘outsiders’ is that, ‘My negroes are peaceable negroes. My negroes are subservient negroes. My negroes do what we tell them to do.’” And in blaming “outsiders,” Fischer is discounting all the things in Louisville — what he has repeatedly declared a compassionate city — that have led us to this point in history. More: Greg Fischer, Louisville police blame looting at Breonna Taylor protest on out-of-towners He’s forgetting that Louisville banks long engaged in redlining — a practice that kept African Americans from buying homes. That Louisville has been and remains deeply segregated in its housing patterns — and white people complain about attempts to integrate their neighborhoods even today. He’s forgetting the riots and protests of those opposed to forced busing in the 1970s because white people didn’t want their children taught in the same schools as black children. He forgets that we had to put police on school buses to make sure white adults didn’t harm the black children who were simply trying to go to class. He’s forgetting the unrest in the 90s when there was a string of shootings involving police that left several black men dead, including one who was handcuffed when he was shot. He’s forgetting the systemic racism in the police department that led to young men of color being pulled over and yanked from their cars during routine traffic stops, being the subject of police searches and being handcuffed on the side of the road even though they have done nothing wrong. None of those things fit with his boast that Louisville is a compassionate city. Hollis said he believes the only things that will end the protests and the often-dangerous confrontations between the black community and the police are communication and leadership. Two things there have been far too little of — not just now but going back decades. The morning after: What happened at Monday's David McAtee and Breonna Taylor protests Fischer has failed on both accounts. You'd think after nearly 10 years in office, he'd have figured both those things out. He is seen as helping to cover up what happened in the death of Taylor when police broke into her apartment with a no-knock warrant in the middle of the night. There was no acknowledgement the city had erred until nearly two months after she died, and police still haven’t released their internal investigation of her death. He hasn’t stepped outside of his bunker — even during the peaceful daytime rallies — to talk to protesters. More importantly, he hasn’t gone to listen to them. His answer to protesters in this compassionate city has been to fill their lungs with chemical weapons rather than fill his own ears with their anger, their worries and their fears. And when he issued a curfew order and then sent police and National Guardsmen to enforce it at a gathering at 26th and Broadway early Monday morning, he sent a message about what was important to him and this community. More: Curfew remains in effect for Louisville for at least another night amid protests “You protect things that can be replaced by killing black people who can’t be replaced,” Hollis said.

It's president. Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. What happened in the city last night was a total disgrace. The president urging states to dominate the situation, calling the nation's Governors Week in a Monday conference call and going a step further during his prepared remarks. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. That message received immediate pushback. I say Thank you, but no, thank you. I care more about them. Then some of the noise I heard on a morning focal. Meanwhile, after protesters were cleared, the president walking across the street to ST John's Episcopal Church, which was damaged in a fire Sunday, stopping to hold up a Bible, a move condemned by church officials. I just can't believe what my eyes see tonight, Advertisement What you need to know about your rights if you're planning to take part in protests Share Shares Copy Link Copy Every American has the right to demonstrate peacefully. It's right there in the First Amendment. But it's not as simple as showing up with a sign.There are some measures officials can use to limit protests, and it's easy to accidentally tiptoe into legally murky territory if you don't know the specifics.So before you go, read up.Timothy Zick is a professor of government and citizenship at the College of William & Mary Law School. He specializes in constitutional law and the First Amendment, and he's written several books about both, including 2009's ""Speech Out of Doors: Preserving First Amendment Liberties in Public Spaces.""Emerson Sykes is a staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Technology and Privacy Project, who studies free speech protections under the First Amendment. Previously, he worked for Africa at the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law to protect free speech.1. What are my rights as a protester?The First Amendment gives Americans the right to assemble peacefully and air our grievances. Historically, we've relied on protests to hold power to account — think the March on Washington in 1963 for civil rights or the March for Our Lives demonstration in 2018 for gun control.The government can't stop you from peacefully protesting, but they can impose some restrictions on the time, place and manner of the protest — for example, barring protesters from walking onto a public highway or instituting a curfew that affects when protests end, Sykes said.They can't block a protest simply because of its content, though.If protests are planned in advance, organizers may obtain a permit so law enforcement can block off public spaces for them to demonstrate, Sykes said.There are protections, though, for ""spontaneous protests"" that spawn in response to current events, like the protests that spawned after George Floyd's death, he said.The First Amendment does not continue to protect protests that escalate to violence or the destruction of private or public property, he said.That's when law enforcement has the right to end them and deescalate threats of violence, he said.2. Where can and can't I protest?A slew of public spaces are OK for protests — sidewalks, city parks, streets and other public forums are usually lawful, Sykes said.Some states require you file a permit to block off streets, and the right to assembly doesn't give you the automatic right to march on a public highway, Zick said.People can be arrested or cited for blocking passage, he said.On private property, you don't have the right to assemble.Zick called it the ""no man's land"" in terms of the First Amendment, and police can move you off the property and keep you from demonstrating there.They may even have that right to move you even if you're on public property. Special rules apply to government buildings because protests may disrupt business going on inside, Sykes said.If the protest was permitted, you should be allowed to stay where you are — but leaving the permitted protest site may unintentionally lead you into prohibited places, he said.3. Can police or local leaders tell us to disperse?It depends, Sykes said: If a mayor pleads with people to go home, you have no legal obligation to comply.But police and local government can order you to leave, say, if they've imposed a curfew, as long as they give you ample notice to leave safely, Sykes said.If you stay on the street past a curfew — or if you protest on private property — you may be cited or arrested.4. What can I record?You have the right to take photos and videos of what's happening at a protest in a public place, and you can record police, too.Different states have different rules about audio recording and sharing that without the consent of the people whose voices you recorded, but the visual portion of videos and photos are always protected by the First Amendment, Sykes said.If you're interfering with legitimate police operations, they can ask you to move. It's best to videotape them from a safe distance.Police can't ask you to give them your phone or forcibly confiscate it without a search warrant, which they would've needed to obtain from a judge, he said.If they demand your phone, though, comply to avoid escalating the confrontation. Afterward, you can file a police misconduct complaint or contact the ACLU, he said.5. Someone took a picture of my face at a public protest. Is that allowed?At a public protest in the United States, you consent to a photo just by being there. Anyone who photographs you protesting in a public place may have a right to use your image, and you may see images of yourself in the media or online, Zick said.6. What should I pack to stay safe at a protest?Pack light, Sykes said. He suggests you bring water and a snack at minimum. If you bring a bag, prepare for it to be searched.In a pandemic, wearing a mask can keep you from breathing in droplets containing coronavirus. Coming within close contact of other protesters could expose you to their spit or sneezes, which may carry the coronavirus.Of course, keep an ID on your person, too.And if you fear you'll be arrested and will need legal help, memorize the number to a local or national law organization that could assist you in getting out of jail and handling your case afterward, Sykes said.7. What can — and can't — police do during a protest?It's the responsibility of police to protect your right to peaceful assembly.They're also empowered to uphold law and order, which gives them broad authority to deescalate threats of violence how they see fit.How they deescalate that violence depends on local laws and the circumstances under which they use them, which can be difficult to prove in court if you believe they used force unlawfully, Zick said.Like Sykes said, police do not have the right to search your phone or personal devices without a warrant, which only a judge can grant them.They also don't have permission to delete content from your phone, so if they tell you to delete a video you took or delete it themselves, they're in the wrong, he said.8. What can I do if a police officer stops me?Be polite. Don't resist.Ask them if you're free to go after speaking with them, Sykes said.If they say yes, calmly walk away and rejoin the protest if it's safe to.If they say no, and they detain you, don't resist and keep calm, Sykes said. Ask them what crime you're suspected of committing.9. What can I do if I get arrested?Some people get arrested intentionally as a form of civil disobedience. But whether or not you planned to get handcuffed, you shouldn't resist arrest, Sykes said.It's the best chance you have to stay safe.During your arrest, you can remain silent, as is your right, Sykes said.In some states, police are permitted to know your name if they ask, but they don't have the right to know where you're from or your citizenship status, he said.You can also ask for a lawyer — remember that number you held onto for legal support.If you're booked into jail, call a lawyer immediately, Sykes said.Police can't listen in on your call if you're phoning a lawyer, but they can listen in if you're calling a friend or family member, so be aware, he said.10. What can I do if I feel law enforcement or other officials violated my rights?You can sue for civil rights violations.You're allowed to do that under Section 1983 of federal law, which covers violations by state actors and police who violate First Amendment rights to assemble, speak and petition.Some protesters file large class-action suits that are occasionally successful, and sometimes authorities can pay damages when they decide litigation isn't worth it, Zick said.But qualified immunity can shield officers from civil liability if they didn't violate a clearly established law, he said.Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that protects police officers accused of interfering with constitutional rights from being liable unless they violated a clearly established and defined law.The lines are blurred at protests of what police are allowed to do and what constitutes overreaching, so ""clearly established"" constitutional rights are difficult to determine, Zick said.In this way, many police officers are protected by qualified immunity, Sykes said.""Those cases are difficult to win and expensive in terms of personal time and resources,"" Zick said. ""Naturally, I think a lot of the protesters whose rights may well have been violated may not pursue cases.""11. Can my workplace fire me if they find out I attended a protest?That depends on the contract you made with your employer when you were hired, but yes, it's possible, Sykes said.You have stronger constitutional protections for what you do outside of work, but depending on what you agreed on when you were hired, a company may be able to terminate your employment, he said.",0.0

Advertisement Police take a knee, drawing cheers, support from protesters in Fort Worth, Texas Share Shares Copy Link Copy Despite some tense moments during protests in Fort Worth, Texas, officers and the police chief drew praise when they kneeled with protesters to show support.Protesters there voiced concerns once again Monday night, drawing attention to deaths of black people by police officers. But when a black police officer responding to the crowds kneeled to show support and other officers joined, a crowd erupted into praise, prompting protesters to shake the hands of police and hug them. Protesters in Fort Worth have been noting deaths such as George Floyd, who died on Memorial Day in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee on his neck for more than eight minutes. The officer, who was since fired, now faces third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.Crowds there also have called attention to Atatiana Jefferson, whose family said she was playing video games with her nephew when a Fort Worth officer shot her in her home in October. The officer resigned and has been indicted on a murder charge. Later Monday, police in riot gear responded to the crowds, causing confusion, but police chief Ed Kraus took a knee and prayed with people, and officers in riot gear later did, too, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.""I think it's a good step,"" Kraus said.

After BreonnaTaylor.com briefly led to a donation page for the Louisville Metro Police Foundation before it was pulled from the internet, LouisvillePoliceDepartment.com now leads visitors to a list of resources for protesters. At the website, shared on social media Tuesday morning, visitors can find links to sites for Taylor and David McAtee, both of whom were shot and killed by law enforcement in Louisville. Links to The Bail Project, the Action Network and Black Lives Matter are also included. 'My son didn't hurt nobody': David McAtee, Louisville business owner, killed by authorities More: What to know about the investigations into the police shooting of Breonna Taylor The website arrives after the internet address featuring Taylor's name encouraged visitors to ""support good police"" by donating to the Louisville Metro Police Foundation, a private group that promotes the police and public safety measures. The Taylor website was pulled down hours after The Courier Journal reported on it amid backlash on social media and condemnation from the police foundation. ""We would NEVER do something so inappropriate and are doing our best to track down who put our link on this page,"" Tracie Texas Shifflett, the director of the foundation, said Monday. ""We are saddened and disheartened that someone would do this, especially during this time when we need unity and not division."" The site using Taylor's name had been up since May 16, attorney Lonita Baker, who is representing Taylor's family, told The Courier Journal on Monday. ""It is a slap in the face whether they were part of putting this site together or not they have not tried to take it down,"" Baker said. Louisville has seen an uprising of protests over the past week, as hundreds demand justice for Taylor, a 26-year-old unarmed black woman who was shot and killed in a police raid in March. Protesters and community leaders want a permanent end to no-knock warrants, like the one used in the raid that left Taylor dead, and for the officers who shot at her to be fired and prosecuted. No-knock warrants have been suspended. Read this: Mayor Fischer suspends no-knock warrants, telling Breonna Taylor protesters 'I hear you' The unrest in Louisville has captured national attention, joining protests against police brutality in several major cities following the death of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. Law enforcement shot and killed McAtee, the owner of YaYa's BBQ in western Louisville, early Monday morning after officials said someone shot at officers. Mayor Greg Fischer fired former LMPD Chief Steve Conrad after learning no police had their body cameras on during the shooting. McAtee's incident is under state, federal and local police investigation. This story may be updated.

And the mayhem has led many merchants to clear their stock, board their windows and barricade their doors against more trouble. Neither business leaders nor city officials have yet to tabulate estimates of damage after nights of protests related to the death of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor, an unarmed black woman who was shot during a March 13 police raid at her apartment. Business leaders, certainly upset about the millions of dollars in losses, say the violent protests signal a need for a more inclusive and diverse economy throughout Louisville. After looters and vandals hit dozens of downtown businesses late last Friday night and early Saturday morning, another wave hit Monday night into early Tuesday on West Broadway, New Cut Road and Outer Loop after law enforcement officers fatally shot David McAtee, a well-known barbecue stand owner who they say fired first. Vandals smashed plate-glass windows, hammered glass display cabinets inside stores and made off with everything from fine wines at the upscale Eddie Merlot's to potato chips from a corner supermarket at Third and Broadway. They spray-painted ""BLM"" — Black Lives Matter — and anti-police messages on downtown buildings. A coin shop, restaurants, a Subway, a watch repair, CVS pharmacy, Heine Brothers' Coffee, Stewart's Pawn Shop and several hotels were hit. That included the 600-room Omni Louisville Hotel, where several street-level windows were broken, especially around Falls City Market on Liberty Street. Live updates: LMPD says additional video footage shows David McAtee firing gun Inside the hotel complex, looters busted into a liquor store, smashed bottles of bourbon, vodka and wine and carted some off, spokeswoman Kerri Richardson said. Because of the damage, the hotel likely will need to delay its expected July reopening ""even longer"" after closing during the coronavirus pandemic, she said. The epicenter of the destruction through Monday involved the blocks bounded by Market Street and Broadway between Sixth and Second streets. But other areas, such as a Norton Healthcare facility and a tire store along East Broadway, as well as a Dixie Highway sporting goods store, also sustained smashed windows, broken equipment and thefts. Late Monday night and early Tuesday destruction spread to southern Louisville, where looters hit a Walgreens at New Cut Road and Palatka Road, as well as the Walmart Supercenter, Verizon and GameStop on Outer Loop. In a statement, Walmart officials said ""we’re monitoring this situation closely as it develops and will continue closing stores in select markets as a safety precaution for our customers and associates. Several locations have been impacted, and we will work to assess the damage and plan to reopen as soon as possible."" The Kroger at 28th Street and Broadway was closed after looters busted into a side door overnight Monday. Thieves also broke into nearby Chase bank ATM where video from mayhem showed several making off with handfuls of cash. The destruction has left business owners wondering what's next. ""Nobody wants to be in a city with graffiti and boarded-up windows. That's what we've got now,"" said Amar Kahedy, who owns the Weissinger-Gaulbert and the Fincastle, apartment and office buildings with ground level retail shops near Third and Broadway. He also owns The Gramercy, a wedding and events venue nearby. Several property owners and proprietors expressed frustration with Louisville Metro Police's handling of the growing threat as rioters went on a spree, most of it starting late Friday night. LMPD arrested 136 people in a stretch between May 28 and Monday at 8 p.m., which included some for looting. Most were charged with unlawful assembly and curfew violations, spokesman Dwight Mitchell said. Gant Hill, a commercial real estate broker who manages Kahedy's three large buildings, which house more than 100 tenants, said he rushed to the scene in the wee hours of Saturday morning. Related: Kroger to reopen store that was looted near site of David McAtee's death Maintenance crews hammered boards over damaged windows at the Weissinger-Gaulbert apartments in downtown Louisville after vandals in crowds of protesters smashed windows. (Photo: Courtesy of Gant Hill) He said demonstrators elbowed past him as he and maintenance staff swept up glass — to grab a handful of potato chip bags from the bodega. One guy brazenly walked up and smashed more glass in doors and windows with a machete-looking tool, Hill said. He said that he didn't feel safe confronting anyone and that there were few police in the area. ""I think (Louisville police) have been too quiet,"" Hill said. ""They've not been proactive. They've been reactive. More should have been done before Friday."" At The Watch Shop on Broadway, owner Barry Baker said people smashed through windows and destroyed mini blinds. They toppled a cabinet and cracked hammers over other glass display fronts and counters. Most cases were empty except for some of Baker's wife Chevvy's sterling silver items, which intruders left. ""They didn't take anything,"" they just wanted to create a mess, Baker said. Hill said at one point he spotted a group of men emerge from large vehicles dressed in black and carrying backpacks. They headed into the crowds to begin destroying shops and other property, he said. A TV crew aired a video, which Hill shared on his Facebook page, of one of the men using a hammer to smash a line of windows as he marched along a street. Hill wrote on Facebook ""that peaceful protests have been overshadowed by riots and looting, mainly from professional terrorists that are not from here and are not here on behalf of Breonna."" Greater Louisville Inc., the metro's chamber of commerce, released a statement from president and CEO Sarah Davasher-Wisdom pledging more involvement by the group: ""We recognize the anger and frustration that has been building in our region and our nation in response to violent acts against communities of color. ""Greater Louisville must come together to strengthen the ties within our community, embrace diversity and seek meaningful change to build a truly inclusive economy. In the coming days and weeks, GLI will continue our outreach to business and community leaders so we can learn ways to impact change and contribute toward meaningful discussions about race and inequities in our region.” See also: Viral crowdfund raises more than $200,000 for David McAtee's family For his part, Kahdey worries that a $100,000 estimate for new glass and other repairs won't touch the real loss: the trust and confidence of residents and other tenants who may decide they'd rather move from downtown. The unrest may reverse years of work to make the Central Business District a vibrant, attractive place. ""It's the business owners that are have been left to pick up the pieces,"" he said. Baker, who joined the enterprise founded by his uncle more than 30 years ago, predicted the shop could struggle to recover. But he's determined that it will see its 80th anniversary this year even if it means keeping retail customers away and focusing on his wholesale trade. He was humbled recalling the kindness of strangers who stopped in early Saturday morning to lend a hand, sweeping up glass and helping restore order. A guy named Rex worked for more than two hours, Baker said. He said he handed $50 cash to Rex when he took off only to have the man return moments later and hand the bills back. He told Baker: ""I can't in good conscience take the money."" How can businesses get help? Greater Louisville Inc., the metro chamber of commerce, has circulated that “if your business was damaged as a result of the destruction over the recent days, you may qualify for a low-interest SBA loan. Photograph and document the cost of repair, and submit that information to rick.bobo@louisvilleky.gov.” Grace Schneider: 502-582-4082; gschneider@courierjournal.com; Twitter: @gesinfk.

And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity.

That’s how Ruthie Ochs described the damage to her Downtown candy store after a weekend of break-ins and looting in the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing at the hands of police in Minneapolis. Peter Minges & Son, which has been at the same location at 138 W. Court St. for more than a century, has been struggling to stay solvent following the statewide shutdown of non-essential businesses to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The old-fashioned candy shop, which specializes in hard-to-find sweets such as candy cigarettes and marshmallow cones, stayed open during the shutdown because it was classified as a grocery providing essential services. But customers have been scarce. ""At one point, we had days where we were only ringing $38 (in sales),’’ store manager Heather Rhor told an Enquirer reporter Monday afternoon. ""Now this.’’ Rhor was referring to the vandals who broke out a display window just after midnight Friday and stole nearly $1,000 worth of flavored syrup used in snow cones and other treats. ""We have insurance, but replacing the windows and the merchandise is still going to set us back financially,'' she said. ""People think we're closed because of what's been happening, so the loss of business is going to be catastrophic, too.'' The damage could have been worse. Rhor said a longtime customer and two of his friends drove off the vandals and stood guard outside the store until the police arrived. “He saved our store,’’ Rhor said, referring to the African American man she knows only as Jessie. According to Rhor, Jessie had taken to the streets earlier in the day to join throngs of other peaceful protesters before the vandalism began after dark, hitting more than 50 businesses, primarily in Downtown and Over-the-Rhine. Ochs and Rhor both support the protesters, but they described the vandals as nothing more than common criminals. “These weren’t protesters who tried to break in. These were criminals using the protests for cover, plain and simple,’’ Rhor said. “We all so much agree with the protest as long as it’s done in a peaceful way.’’ 'It hurts everybody' That was the consensus among a handful of shop owners – both black and white – who were hit hard by vandals over the weekend in Cincinnati. All the windows at Richter & Phillips jewelry store Downtown were boarded after vandals tried to break in over the weekend (Photo: Randy Tucker/Enquirer media) Three separate groups of teenagers made unsuccessful attempts Friday night to break out the windows at Richter & Phillips jewelry store Downtown on Sixth Street, according to owner Rick Fehr. First, a group of mostly black teenagers tried to break out the windows with a bat before they were chased away by police. A second group of vandals hurled rocks, and a third group used a crowbar to try to break in, Fehr said. The vandals cracked several reinforced windows but never broke into the jewelry store, which has been Downtown since 1896. Still, Fehr said he decided to board all the windows in his store the next day just in case the vandals returned. “We know who they are,’’ Fehr said, noting that the suspects were all captured on security camera tapes now in the hands of police. ""One of them couldn’t have been more than 10 years old. They weren’t doing this because of the protests. It had nothing to do with what happened to Floyd.’’ Fehr said Derek Chauvin, the fired Minneapolis police officer seen on video grinding his knee into the back of Floyd’s neck until he was dead, should be punished. ""He basically murdered the guy, and there isn't anybody I know that doesn't understand that and feel sorrow for the family and everybody that's involved,'' he said. But while he sympathizes with the protesters, Fehr said the vandals are hurting the protesters' cause by giving the news media and authorities an excuse to look past the systemic racism and police brutality that led to the protests and focus on the chaos instead. ""We need a dialogue about this, there’s no question, and more than just lip service,'' Fehr said. ""But just to decide you're going to go after businesses and go after the authorities and police is just not the correct approach. Inevitably, it hurts everybody.’’ As much as he wants to support the protesters, Fehr said his first responsibility is keeping his business running and making payroll for his employees, some of whom have worked at the store for more than 40 years. The recent wave of vandalism couldn’t have come at a worse time. ""Business has been slow. People are still generally concerned about going out with COVID on their minds...and all destruction and violence is just another layer on top of people's concerns about going out to shop,'' Fehr said. Mike Deininger of MiCA 12/v holds up one of the rocks vandals used to break through the gift shop's storefront over the weekend (Photo: Randy Tucker/Enquirer media) 'In the scale of things, we're not the victims' In Over-the-Rhine, vandals shattered windows with rocks the size of small boulders and stole hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise from MiCA 12/v, an eclectic gift shop on the corner of 12th and Vine streets that re-opened less than three weeks ago after the coronavirus shutdown was lifted. Still, owner Carolyn Deininger, who runs the shop with her husband, Mike Deininger, said she's not bitter. “On the heels of closing for two and a half months and losing all that revenue, it’s hard to have this happen,’’ she said. ""At the same time, we sympathize with the peaceful protesters, so when we’re feeling victimized, in the scale of things, we’re not the victims of what’s going on.’’ Her husband said he feels the same way but can’t help stressing about the prospect of spending thousands of dollars on repairs and replacing stolen merchandise. “We’ve been here 13 years and only had one window broken up until this weekend,’’ he said. ""Now we have eight. If insurance doesn’t cover it, it would be a huge hit for us. New windows could cost close to $20,000.'' While the couple said their current situation “sucks,’’ they promised to persevere and said they were inspired by the outpouring of support they’ve received from friends, neighbors, even strangers. “We’ve had so many offers of help from people in the neighborhood,'' Mike Deininger said. ""They just showed up Saturday with brooms and dustpans to help get the glass off the street.'' While the continued protests remain a concern, the couple said they don't blame the peaceful protesters for what happened to their store. “They’re not all coming here to smash windows. Very few of them are,’’ Mike Deininger said. Means Cameron stands in the doorway of his Downtown coffee shop, where vandals shattered the front window trying to break in over the weekend (Photo: Randy Tucker/ Enquirer media) Black-owned businesses should be 'off-limits' Means Cameron, who owns blaCk Coffee lounge and BlaCkOWned Outerwear at the corner of Ninth and Elm streets Downtown, also sympathizes with the protesters. But he said he feels like he's been victimized twice by the vandalism associated with the protests. Vandals tried unsuccessfully to break through the front window of his coffee shop Friday night before a neighbor living upstairs in the building chased them away, according to Cameron, who’s coffee shop has been open for less than a year. His clothing store was untouched, but Cameron said he was still angry and upset “I felt like I was being punished on both ends,’’ he said. “As a black man, I feel the rage, I feel upset about what’s happening, but I’m not going around busting up things, especially not black-owned businesses.'' Cameron said vandals not only damaged his business, they also damaged the legacy of African American pioneers who overcame centuries of racial disadvantage to start their own businesses. “People have told me don’t be upset. It’s just a window. It can be replaced,'' he said. ""But it’s deeper than that. That window represents generations of struggle by our ancestors. That window represents every person who fought before us, so we could even use the term 'black-owned-business.' We should be off-limits (to protesters), period.'' Cameron said the one silver lining for him in the midst of all the chaos and destruction has been the outpouring of support from his customers. ""When I got to work today, there were 20 people lined up outside the coffee shop saying they were there to support me,'' he said Tuesday morning. ""I'm busier today than I've been since COVID-19 began.''

Leaders from U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams to Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Amy Acton and Gov. Mike DeWine have expressed concerns about new outbreaks of the respiratory disease that could come from the densely populated protests. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms even advised protesters to get a COVID-19 test. More: Where can you get tested for COVID-19? New map shows Ohio testing sites Ohio's restriction on gatherings of 10 or more people never applied to First Amendment-protected activities, such as religious services or protests. Still, Acton advised those present to take proper health precautions, such as wearing masks or staying farther apart. ""We're asking that people do it as safely as they can,"" Acton said. ""Speak. Do so safely. Do so with that kindness and thought for one another."" Because of the lag time between someone being infected, presenting symptoms and taking a COVID0-19 test, it could be weeks before Ohio knows the affect of the gatherings on new cases. 'We've handled this well' On Monday, President Donald Trump encouraged governors nationwide to use force to quell protests and riots. ""If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time,"" Trump told governors in a conference call. ""They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate."" DeWine, who has deployed the Ohio National Guard to assist local police in Columbus and Cleveland, said he was on the conference call but didn't think Trump's assessment applied to Ohio. ""We've have handled this well – not perfectly, because nothing is perfect,"" DeWine said. “Going through serious demonstrations that then are hijacked – sometimes late at night, by violent people – all the while during a coronavirus leads to unique challenges.” Changes to come Ohio's police need more quality training on implicit bias and the public needs more transparency when officers fail, DeWine said Tuesday. He's working with lawmakers to address problems, such as police officers fired for misconduct finding work elsewhere. ""There need to be some changes,"" DeWine said. ""It doesn't mean that the vast majority of police officers aren't great. They're doing a great job, but you get one bad apple in there and it ruins it for society."" Training is often implemented inconsistently across the state's more than 600 law enforcement agencies without proper funding or a mandate that it's completed. Former Gov. John Kasich worked with leaders, including former state Rep. Alicia Reece, on best practices for police-community relations, including collecting data on traffic stops to ensure bias wasn't a factor and documenting citizens' concerns annually. But those recommendations, made after the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, were never implemented. Democratic lawmakers introduced a resolution to declare racism a public health crisis in Ohio, joining similar proposals in Columbus and Akron. If enacted, Ohio would be the first state to make that declaration. ""It is unacceptable that your ZIP code, on average, can predict how long you can live,"" said Acton, who taught classes about racism as a public health issue. ""There are things that we can't control. But there are things that are in our control. And even in the times when we're on our knees and reeling is this pearl of hope that we can do more."" Hospitals to resume surgeries Ohio hospitals are allowed to resume surgeries that were previously delayed by the coronavirus, DeWine said. Hospitals are required to maintain adequate personal protective equipment and to create a plan for conserving and monitoring that equipment. Zoo, museum details Thursday The Cincinnati Museum Center laid off 50 full-time staff and 125 part-time staff who had previously been furloughed because of a financial shortfall caused by the coronavirus closures. The Cincinnati Zoo's leaders have been eager to reopen. DeWine said he would have ""good news"" for them Thursday. ""The advantage of a zoo is it's primarily outside. When you get inside, it's a little more problematic, but in most of these cases, they have worked out a way that appears it's going to work.""

Another was a man known as “Mr. Indianapolis,"" a former star football player. Yet another was a federal officer working security during a protest.They are among the people who have been killed as protests roiled American cities in the week since 46-year-old George Floyd died when a white officer jammed his knee into the back of the black man's neck.The deaths have at times been overshadowed by the shocking images of chaos engulfing cities across America, from heavy-handed riot police tactics to violence, vandalism and arson. Tens of thousands have marched peacefully in demonstrations against police brutality and racism.Many of the people killed were African Americans, compounding the tragedy for black families to lose more members of their community amid the unrest.Dozens more have been hurt in various altercations — vehicles plowing into crowds, police officers suffering head injuries and broken bones and protesters ending up in emergency rooms with a variety of injuries from the melees.The death toll and circumstances surrounding the killings are still being sorted out in many cities, but here is what we know about the cases so far:LOUISVILLEAs local police and the National Guard sought to disperse a crowd early Monday, they heard gunshots and returned fire, killing the owner of a barbecue restaurant, David McAtee. The mayor has since terminated the city’s police chief after finding out that officers on the scene did not activate their body cameras. The state police and the U.S. attorney also are investigating.The 53-year-old McAtee was an African American man known for offering free meals to officers who stopped by.“We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee,” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said. “David was a friend to many, a well-known Barbecue man.”The protests in Louisville have centered not just on Floyd’s killing but also the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home.___OAKLANDA federal law enforcement officer was providing security at the federal courthouse in Oakland during a protest when someone fired shots from a vehicle.Dave Patrick Underwood, 53, died and another officer was critically injured in the shooting.It was not immediately clear if the drive-by shooting was related to the protests, though the federal building’s glass doors were smashed and the front entrance was sprayed with anti-police graffiti.Underwood, who was black, and the other officer were contracted security officers and employed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service; they were monitoring a nearby protest.No one has been arrested and a motive for the shooting has not yet been determined.Underwood was the brother of Angela Underwood Jacobs, recently a Republican candidate to fill a vacant U.S. congressional district north of Los Angeles.___INDIANAPOLISTwo people were killed over the weekend amid unrest in Indianapolis, including 38-year-old Chris Beaty, a former offensive lineman for Indiana University.Beaty was known as “Mr. Indianapolis"" and remained involved with the Hoosiers long after his graduation. He also was a prominent businessman in the city and ran multiple nightclubs.“I am at a loss for words. The news of the passing of Chris Beaty is just devastating,” coach Tom Allen said in a statement. “Since I returned home to coach at Indiana, Chris embraced me, encouraged me and supported me! His passion for life and Indiana Football energized me every time we were together.""The circumstances of his shooting weren't immediately clear but some media reports said it happened near an apartment where he lived. It also occurred the same night that an 18-year-old man also was fatally shot as protests broke out in the city.___MINNEAPOLISIn what is believed to be the first killing since the protests broke out, a 43-year-old black man was fatally shot outside a pawn shop as rioting broke out last week in Minneapolis and then spread nationally.The owner of the pawn shop, who is white, was arrested in the death of Calvin L. Horton Jr. Police say they are investigating the circumstances surrounding the killing, including whether it was related to protests in the neighborhood.The shop was described as having been significantly damaged during unrest.___OMAHA, NEBRASKAA 22-year-old black man was killed after authorities said he tussled with the owner of two bars in downtown Omaha. Surveillance video of the strip of bars shows a group of people, including James Scurlock, approach bar owner Jake Gardner.Two people are seen on the video tackling Gardner, who ended up on his back and fired shots in the air. Seconds later, Scurlock is seen tackling Gardner, who then fires the gun over his shoulder, striking Scurlock.Authorities have declined to press charges, calling the shooting self-defense.___DETROITA 21-year-old man was killed in downtown Detroit after someone fired shots into a vehicle during a protest. According to a police report, the man was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car in a parking lot with two others when someone fired shots into the vehicle and then fled on foot.___CHICAGO SUBURBTwo people were killed during unrest Monday in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, according to a town official. Spokesman Ray Hanania did not provide details about those who were killed but said it happened amid protests there.",0.0

The American Identitarian Movement says it prohibits violence and illegal activity.CNN has reached out to the group for comment.Twitter said it had shut down other fake accounts linked to Identity Evropa, too.The phenomenon of people on the right creating fake Antifa accounts predates the current wave of protests.

Biden joined several governors, senators from both parties and two high-level church leaders in deriding President Donald Trump's handling of the protests. In Washington, D.C., protesters were back at the area near the White House where they were dispersed with harsh tactics the day before despite their peaceful behavior. And in Los Angeles -- where police say they have arrested more than 2,700 -- thousands of demonstrators took to the streets. Some are demanding the firing of the city's police chief over remarks he made about looting in the nation's second-largest city. A closer look at some recent developments: Six Atlanta police officers are facing charges over an incident caught on video where they are seen using stun guns and forcefully removing two college students from a car. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said an investigation would be launched into the Minneapolis Police Department, which is also facing a civil rights complaint. George Floyd's funeral will be held June 9 in his hometown of Houston. The family accepted an offer from former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. to pay for the funeral services. There will be two memorial services held in Minneapolis and North Carolina before the funeral.

Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for the Daily Briefing. Here's the latest news: Large protest again near White House Crowds in the thousands chanted, ""I can't breathe'' on a fifth day of protests in Washington, D.C., as demonstrators returned to the area near the White House where they were forcefully removed Monday. Law enforcement had used what appeared to be tear gas -- officials later said they were gas canisters -- shields and horses to clear out a group of peaceful demonstrators to make way for President Donald Trump's visit to a nearby church. There, he stood and was photographed holding a Bible. Several thousand protesters were gathered north of Lafayette Square on Tuesday, forced onto an adjacent street by a large, black chain link fence that had been installed overnight around the park. Gone, for the moment, were the confrontational police lines that were so prominent a day before. It wasn't clear how forcefully police would enforce the 7 p.m. ET curfew. L.A. police chief apologizes for remarks amid calls for his firing Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore has apologized and is fending off calls for his firing after likening looters in the city to those responsible for George Floyd's death. ""We didn't have protests last night. We had criminal acts,"" Moore said Monday. ""We didn't have people mourning the death of this man, George Floyd. We had people capitalizing. His death is on their hands, as much as it is those officers."" Moore tweeted out an apology, saying he misspoke. ""While I did immediately correct myself, I recognize that my initial words were terribly offensive,'' Moore said via Twitter. ""Looting is wrong, but it is not the equivalent of murder and I did not mean to equate the two. I deeply regret and humbly apologize for my characterization.'' Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti was called out on social media, with people demanding that he fire Moore. Later Tuesday, protesters gathered at Garcetti's home. On Tuesday, more than 1,000 protesters made their way for a second day through the streets of Hollywood, and several hundred demonstrated in downtown Los Angeles, at times kneeling en masse and at others calling for Moore's resignation. -- Jordan Culver Mother of Floyd's daughter speaks out about her loss The mother of George Floyd's 6-year-old daughter lamented that he'll miss the girl's future milestones, like graduating and getting married, in her first public comments since he died in police custody May 25. From a podium at the city hall in Minneapolis, where Floyd moved from Houston seeking better work opportunities, Roxie Washington said she wanted to speak up for him and their daughter Gianna, who joined her. Washington also said she wants justice for Floyd. “He’ll never see her grow up, graduate. He will never walk her down the aisle,'' said Washington, who struggled to fight back tears. ""If there’s a problem she’s had and needs her dad, she does not have that anymore.” -- Mark Emmert Six Atlanta officers charged in incident with college students Six Atlanta police officers seen on video forcefully pulling two young college students out of their car during Saturday protests have been charged, mostly with aggravated assault, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said. Two of the officers, investigators Ivory Streeter and Mark Gardner, were fired Sunday. The incident was caught on body cam video and denounced by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Messiah Young and his girlfriend Taniyah Pilgrim were caught in traffic Saturday night during protests over George Floyd's killing when they were approached by the officers yelling commands. The video shows the officers using stun guns on the couple, breaking the car window with a baton and yanking out both students, who are heard screaming and asking what was happening. ""We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress,'' Bottoms said, ""but we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.'' Another church leader denounces Trump For the second day in a row, a high-ranking church official has taken issue with President Donald Trump's actions. A day after a much-criticized photo op at a fire-damaged Episcopal church near the White House, Trump took his anti-protester ""law and order"" message to a Catholic shrine Tuesday, a visit that drew swift condemnation from a top church official. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump traveled across town Tuesday for a brief visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine adjacent to The Catholic University of America. The Trumps posed for photos and stood for a few minutes in front of a statue of Saint Pope John Paul II outside the shrine. Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory expressed his disapproval of the presidential visit, saying in a statement: “I find it baffling that and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree.” On Monday, Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington told CNN she was ""outraged'' that police in riot gear had used tear gas to clear a path across Lafayette Park for Trump and other members of his administration to walk to St. John's Episcopal Church for a photo-op. -- David Jackson, Michael Collins and Nicholas Wu GOP senators criticize Trump: 'Word of God as a political prop' Minnesota files human rights complaint against Minneapolis police The Minnesota Department of Human Rights said it will file a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department in the death of George Floyd and begin an investigation. According to a news release, the investigation will focus on policies, procedures and practices over the past 10 years to ""determine if the MPD has engaged in systemic discriminatory practices towards people of color and ensure any such practices are stopped."" “Silence is complicity,'' Gov. Tim Walz said in a statement. ""Minnesotans can expect our administration to use every tool at our disposal to deconstruct generations of systemic racism in our state.” -- Mark Emmert Biden blasts Trump, urges national unity Former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday invoked George Floyd's last words, ""I can't breathe"" to address the nation's escalating protests and racial tensions. Biden, speaking at Philadelphia City Hall, criticized President Donald Trump's handling of the protests, accusing him of trafficking in ""fear and division."" But he added that problems of racism and social injustice in America go beyond Trump. ""I wish I could say that hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. But it didn't and it won't,"" Biden said. ""American history is not a fairy tale with a guaranteed happy ending."" Minneapolis officers fire paint ""marking rounds"" to enforce curfew A video shared on social media appears to show Minneapolis law enforcement shooting ""marking rounds"" of green paint at people standing on their front porch last weekend. The video, which was shared by Minneapolis resident Tanya Kerssen on Saturday evening, shows a Humvee and an officer dressed in riot gear passing by her home to enforce curfew. A group of around 15 to 20 police officers and National Guardsmen then approach the front of the house, shouting, ""Go inside!"" five or six times and, ""Get in your house now!"" After around 10 seconds of commands, one officer yells, ""Light 'em up,"" and starts shooting green paint bullets at Kerssen and other unidentified people, according to the video. Neither Kerssen nor the police department immediately responded to a request for comment from USA TODAY. – Joshua Bote New York City gets earlier curfew after night of violence, looting New York City will impose an 8 p.m. curfew for the remainder of the week after violent protests Monday night led to more than 700 arrests. Mayor Bill de Blasio vowed Tuesday to halt looting and violence, saying an 11 p.m. curfew Monday failed to quell the dangerous situation. The looting spread across the boroughs and in midtown Manhattan, where store windows were smashed, goods stolen and fights broke out. ""We saw stuff last night that we will not accept. And we can fight back and we will fight back,"" de Blasio said. – Joseph Spector Truck driver who drove into protesters in Minneapolis released The truck driver who drove into protesters on a Minneapolis interstate over the weekend was released from jail Tuesday, while prosecutors investigate the incident, the Star-Tribune reported. Bogdan Vechirko was jailed Sunday evening on suspicion of assault and held until midday Tuesday in connection with his empty fuel tanker narrowly missing a crowd marching in protest, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said in a statement to the Star-Tribune. “Investigators are in the process of gathering additional information and answers to aid in the charging decision,” the statement continued. Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington told the newspaper Monday that there was no information that made the incident seem intentional. -- Elinor Aspegren Federal prisons locked down The federal Bureau of Prisons has imposed a national lockdown in a move resembling the agency's response to mass rioting at several facilities 25 years ago. Federal authorities, already struggling to contain deadly outbreaks of the coronavirus that has left 68 inmates dead, had ordered nationwide restrictions on inmate movements in March in an attempt to limit the virus' spread. But officials took the more restrictive action late Monday, citing the sometimes violent protests on the nation's streets. ""In light of extensive protest activity occurring around the country, the BOP – in an abundance of caution – is implementing an additional, temporary security measure to ensure the good order and security of our institutions,"" the bureau said in a statement. – Kevin Johnson TikTok apologizes for #GeorgeFloyd, #BlackLivesMatter glitches TikTok promised to promote diversity on its platform and denied claims the social media service blocked posts featuring hashtags related to the death of George Floyd. TikTok said a technical glitch made it temporarily appear as if posts with the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd received no views. The platform said it was dealing with a display issue, and videos featuring those tags amassed more than 2 billion views. The problem was not ""an intentional act to suppress the experiences and invalidate the emotions felt by the Black community,"" read an apology blog post from Vanessa Pappas, TikTok's general manager, and director of creator community Kudzi Chikumbu. – Brett Molina Music industry, social media go silent for Blackout Tuesday The music industry took a break from business-as-usual to mark Blackout Tuesday to call attention to the deaths of George Floyd and other black Americans. Big names in entertainment such as Katy Perry, Kylie Jenner, Kevin Hart and Timothee Chalamet showed their support Tuesday on social media, using the hashtags #blackouttuesday and #theshowmustbepaused to help draw attention to the effort. ""While this is only one day, we are working on ways to actively fight for meaningful, systematic change against the injustices black people continue to face,"" the post from the official @hamiltonmusical Instagram account read. – Gary Dinges What is Blackout Tuesday? The social media trend explained More protest coverage from USA TODAY Protesters in DC take shelter inside resident's home after curfew Dozens of protesters took refuge inside a stranger's home in Washington overnight Monday as police funneled a crowd of demonstrators onto one street after a 7 p.m. citywide curfew. Rahul Dubey told NBC Washington that he acted instinctively when he opened his door to roughly 60 demonstrators near his house around 10 p.m., and allowed them to stay until the curfew was lifted at 6 a.m. Reports on social media showed police corralling a group of demonstrators onto one D.C. street as they used pepper spray on the crowd. Dubey told the TV station he was also pepper sprayed. ""The crowd came racing through like a tornado,"" he said. ""We had to keep the door open and keep pulling them in. ... It's the same you would do if there's a storm."" – Ryan W. Miller Man fatally shot, officer critically injured at Las Vegas protests One man was dead and a Las Vegas police officer was on life support Tuesday following a night of angry protests that included two separate shooting incidents. Sheriff Joe Lombardo said officers were attempting to clear protesters throwing rocks and bottles from Las Vegas Boulevard when the officer was shot sometime before midnight. The officer was in ""grave"" condition, Lombardo said. Lombardo said the second incident involved the fatal shooting of an armed man wearing body armor by police and federal agents guarding a federal building in downtown Las Vegas. Lombardo said the man had reached for a firearm. Investigations of both shootings were continuing, Lombardo said. ""What has occurred is utterly unacceptable,"" Lombardo said. ""I hope the community sees it that way, too."" 4 officers shot in St. Louis, police say Four St. Louis police officers were shot early Tuesday as a peaceful protest devolved into ""mayhem,"" Police Chief John Hayden said. The police department tweeted that the officers were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening after the shootings overnight. It was unclear who had fired the shots. Several hundred people rallied peacefully Monday afternoon outside the justice center in downtown St. Louis, including Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards. Protesters later walked to the Gateway Arch National Park and then onto nearby Interstate 64. But later Monday, protesters gathered in front of police headquarters, where officers fired tear gas. Some protesters smashed windows at a downtown 7-11 store and stole items from inside before the building was set on fire.

(Photo: Sarah Haselhorst) Early afternoon sun burned into the shoulders and shins of protesters on Monday who stood in front of the Hamilton County Courthouse to protest George Floyd’s death. For some, this was Day Four. The crowd’s center that ebbed at the courthouse stairs was young, in their 20s and 30s. The edges – older or much younger. Some children sported toothless smiles and handmade signs. A swath of teens lamented that they were too young to vote. But it is protesters in their 20s and 30s – deemed millennials – who mostly populate the march from the courthouse to Cincinnati City Hall and District 1 late into the night. Monday afternoon, Hannah Guth stood back from her peers. It was her third day. Her right arm bore a smudged phone number on it and her acid-wash T-shirt read “Black Lives Matter”. The phone number, an emergency call, was the remnant of Sunday. As were her clothes. Sunday night, she was among those arrested after the city-imposed curfew. She recalled being stuck on a Metro bus for hours, long enough for four protesters on her bus to urinate on themselves. Late into the night, those arrested were gathered outside for hours with their hands zip-tied behind them, Guth said. “I just got out of jail this morning,” she said Monday, adding she hadn't made a trip home between her release and stepping back in to protest. “It was by far the worst thing that’s ever happened to me."" Hannah Guth stands with fellow protesters looking to the Hamilton County Courthouse where the swath of protesters are gathered on Monday, June 1, 2020. (Photo: Sarah Haselhorst) Guth is 23. Her generation is experiencing a lot that others, at the same age, have not. The pandemic had a grip on her life and work as a server and bartender. She’s been isolated at home, scrolling her social media. Events to protest Floyd’s death flooding her feeds. She’s young. She needs people. She needs to be heard. And she is outraged. The Metro bus where Guth sat with her hands bound was packed with protesters just like her. Cincinnati police said they arrested more than 300 people related to protests and curfew violations. The average age, judging from arrest slips, was 23 one night, 24 the other. The oldest arrested protester Guth spoke with during her hold was 30.And maybe that is not new. Protests have mostly been peopled by the young, those on college campuses and those who can take a day off to vent without bearing much consequence. But there was something different Sunday night. She observed an influx of white protesters seated with her in the sea of mass arrests in Over-the-Rhine. Guth, a white woman, was one of the 187 white protesters arrested Sunday. Trent Sulvain noticed the crowd’s racial diversity, too. It looked far different from when, in his freshman year of college, protesters came out after the death of Sam Dubose in 2015. “My people are always out there,” he said. “It feels nice to have allies and support from everyone. Finally, we’re not alone in this.” Trent Sulvain holds up a handmade sign as he kneels on Main Street on Monday, June 1, 2020. (Photo: Sarah Haselhorst) Sulvain is 23. And protesting isn’t new to him or his family. He recalled his mother protesting the 1992 riots that erupted in Los Angelesafter four police officers who had beaten a man named Rodney King in 1991 were acquitted on all charges stemming from his brutal treatment. But there’s a distinction between Sulvain and his mother’s generation: Social media’s role. Thumbing through his Twitter feed inspired Sulvain to make a change. He wanted to make a statement. He couldn’t sit on his phone, scrolling in isolation. And perhaps, Sulvain pondered, the protests were the push people who’d been isolated for weeks needed. They couldn’t be alone in feeling the pain of Floyd’s death. “You have nothing to do but to go online and look at the news,” Mahagany Shaw, 24, said. It’s the recent murders of Floyd and Louisville's Breonna Taylor by police officers that flashed across news stations and inundated social media that Shaw’s been paying attention to. Non-stop news coverage and years of built-up frustration, she said, have intensified into what’s been the past four days of protests. The diversity of millennials out protesting, it’s an important part of their generation. “Seeing all these people out here – every race, every color – it’s beautiful,” she said. Nushong Goba, far left, marching with his friends on Monday, June 1, 2020. (Photo: Sarah Haselhorst) Nushong Goba, 23, was among those protesting with a diverse group of friends. He flew from Arizona back to his family in Cincinnati when the pandemic crept into the U.S. Seeing his friends, many of whom are not people of color, protest alongside him made him feel less alone. He was overwhelmed by Floyd’s death. It left him unsure of how to offer his support to his community. “To see the news that someone just like me, doing something that I do — I run, I cash checks. I used to work at a bank,” he said. “Normal everyday things I usually do, I could be the next victim.” But his fear doesn’t hold him back, it fuels him to protest during the day. Chris Albers became active in civil rights while a student at Northern Kentucky University. Albers said people have been calling him a white ally. But he doesn’t feel deserving of the title. “A lot of people I’m marching with have gone through racial injustice, and I have not experienced that,” he said. “In that way, I cannot relate to them, but I can empathize with their cause.” Chris Albers, in the light grey hat and navy shirt, stands between his friends as the group moved from the courthouse and down Main Street on Monday, June 1, 2020. (Photo: Sarah Haselhorst) Albers holds another privilege, too: His age. He’s 23. Guth, Sulvain, Shaw, Goba and Albers are millennials. They aren’t going home to children. Guth said she wasn’t allowed back at work yet. It’s allowed her to spend time protesting. And their health allows them to march in the sun, during a pandemic, for hours on end, day after day. “Younger people can take the risk,” Goba said. His mother, a registered nurse, couldn’t come out to the protest. She’s an essential worker and was worried she’d potentially expose the crowd to COVID-19. Goba says that being young, his immune system is sturdier. He’s privileged to have his health, while marching with a face mask, in the wake of the pandemic. The pandemic is an added layer that protesters face, but perhaps, the pull young people have to go out and risk their lives in packed protest crowds isn't so different from the 1960s. Some could see it as a rite of passage from generation to generation. Decades ago, young protesters managed to end a war, advance civil rights legislation and launch a second wave of women's rights and the gay rights movement through their marches and cries. Though their fingers weren't clicking away on keyboards, nor were they documenting minute-by-minute coverage on Twitter, they found a way to reach out, to plan, to commit. But Guth, Sulvain, Shaw, Goba and Albers all agree: Social media helped bring the millennial generation out to protest. ""My Twitter timeline was full of stuff and it just inspired me more, because I was at home this morning and it fired me up again,"" Sulvain said. ""I thought, 'I've got to get off my butt, I can't just sit here and scroll on my timeline. I have to get out there and make a change.'"" Mahagany Shaw holds up a sign, standing next to her friend on Monday, June 1, 2020.

On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee begins the first of a planned series of hearings on the origins of the FBI's 2016 Russia investigation into possible ties with the Trump campaign. Republicans are particularly interested in the decision-making inside the Obama-Biden administration. Further, the Senate Homeland Security Committee late last month approved a subpoena along party lines for Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. ""The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the U.S. who is currently trying to be president got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $80,000 a month,"" said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, accused the committee's chairman, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., of abusing his power to aid Trump. ""We're in the middle of the worst public health and economic crisis in a century,"" he said, ""and what is Senator Johnson focused on? Running a political errand for Donald Trump by wasting Homeland Security Committee time and resources attempting to resurrect a craven, previously-debunked smear against Vice President Biden."" It is the allegation at the heart of Trump's impeachment — the president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and conspiracy theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and in December 2019, Trump was impeached for abuse of power by the House of Representatives for making the ask. The Senate acquitted the president in February after a contentious trial. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans using the Senate to try to help get Trump reelected. ""There are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee's attention but instead this committee is doing the president's personal bidding,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a potential contender to be Biden's running mate. During the first Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, senators will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Senate Republicans are launching investigations involving the Obama administration and President Obama's vice president, the presumptive Democratic nominee this time, Joe Biden. Today the Senate Judiciary Committee is beginning hearings on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. Republicans are also investigating what they claim is questionable dealings by the Biden family, although there's no evidence to support those CLAIMS. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis has this preview. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Senate Republicans haven't always shared President Trump's interest in investigating Joe Biden. Those days are over. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK SCOTT: The public deserves to know how a guy who was vice president of the United States, who is currently trying to be president, got away with using the U.S. government to force a foreign country to stop investigating a company that was paying his son over $30,000 - or $80,000 a month. DAVIS: Florida Senator Rick Scott joined every Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee last month to vote for a subpoena of Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm that worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma when Biden's son Hunter served on the board. A spokesman for the Biden campaign has accused Republicans of, quote, ""running a political errand"" for the president. This allegation is at the heart of Trump's impeachment. The president wanted Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption and unfounded theories about the Biden family. Ukraine did not, and Trump was impeached for abuse of power for making the ask. Senate Democrats are howling over what they say is Republicans now using the Senate to try to boost Trump's reelection chances. Here's California Senator Kamala Harris. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAMALA HARRIS: There are literally matters of life and death waiting for our committee's attention. But instead, this committee is doing the president's personal bidding. DAVIS: Today, in the Judiciary Committee, Republicans hold their first oversight hearing into the decision-making process inside the Obama-Biden administration around the FBI investigation of Trump associates during the 2016 campaign. They will hear testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham plans to issue subpoenas for 53 individuals, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, all frequent Trump targets.

Metro Council President David James said it is ""unacceptable"" that the case of Taylor, an unarmed black woman who was shot by police in her apartment on March 13, has not yet been completed. ""The mayor has that power to do it, he has the power to direct resources there, and we demand that that take place"" so it can be turned over to the attorney general, James said during a press briefing Monday. James' comments came hours after an attorney for Taylor's family told The Courier Journal the investigation into the Louisville Metro Police officers' conduct in the fatal shooting could take two to three more months. Taylor's death and the time that has elapsed since police began investigating have led thousands to take to the streets of Louisville to demand justice and express frustration. Catch up: What to know about the investigations into shooting of Breonna Taylor Breonna Taylor (Photo: Christopher 2X) On Tuesday evening, Fischer told protesters gathered at Jefferson Square Park that the city has handed over the police investigation on the Taylor case to Attorney General Daniel Cameron. Fischer said on May 20 that the department had handed over its investigation, but Cameron's office said it did not have the full investigation last week. On Monday, James said he is having the Metro Council's Government Oversight Committee look into two incidents regarding police responses to the protests. First, James said the committee will look into why police fired tear gas on what appeared to be a peaceful demonstration at Jefferson Square before the city's 9 p.m. curfew on Sunday. Assistant Police Chief LaVita Chavous told reporters Sunday night that police dispersed the crowd because some protesters had leaf blowers that could be used to direct chemicals at police. She added that it was an illegal protest even before the curfew set in because participants didn't have a permit. James said Monday this reasoning ""doesn't seem adequate."" Additionally, the committee will investigate the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of David McAtee, who was killed early Monday morning as Louisville Metro Police and National Guard were trying to break up a ""large crowd"" in a parking lot at West Broadway and 26th Street. Police said that shortly after midnight, someone shot at officers at the location, leading the police and National Guard to return fire. Police released additional video footage Tuesday afternoon that they said shows McAtee firing a gun before law enforcement officials returned fire that killed McAtee. James described McAtee, the owner of YaYa's BBQ, as a friend and someone who cared about the West End. CLOSE Louisville police released additional footage Tuesday following the fatal shooting of David McAtee, which they say shows McAtee firing a gun first. Louisville Courier Journal Recap: What happened at Monday's David McAtee and Breonna Taylor protests ""We were told (the National Guard) would be used to protect critical assets in our community. And then I find out ... I find out this morning that my friend is dead because of actions taken by the police department,"" James said through tears. ""We all need to know why. What happened, and why it happened,"" said James, a former police officer. ""Where was the breakdown? How did the National Guard end up being in west Louisville? Why was there such a massive police response to the corner of 26th and Broadway? And why is my friend dead?"" Gov. Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the shooting, which will be a joint effort between the FBI Louisville Field Office and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District, federal officials said. The two Louisville Metro Police officers involved in the shooting did not have body cameras on them, Fischer announced Monday afternoon. This failure to follow police protocol led Fischer to fire LMPD Chief Steve Conrad, who was set to step down at the end of the month. James also announced several other measures during the Monday press conference, including the creation of a permanent committee on equity and inclusion and legislation to make 911 audio calls and LMPD body cameras subject to open records even if the city has an ongoing investigation. More than 10 members of the Metro Council and two state legislators spoke during the press conference about the state of Louisville and actions they demand the Fischer administration take. The latest: Police release video they say shows David McAtee shooting at officers Councilwoman Paula McCraney, D-7th District, said that the ""time is ripe for us to get things right."" “We can no longer stand by the wayside and watch our people suffer,"" said McCraney, who is a co-chair on the newly formed Civilian Review Board work group. Councilwoman Donna Purvis, D-5th District, said the ""community is tired of being played with"" and needs an answer quickly on what led to the fatal shooting of McAtee and why police and National Guard members were dispatched to the West End. “The community waited too long to get the evidence and the facts leading to Breonna Taylor’s murder,"" Purvis said. ""I don’t want us to wait another three months to tell us why did we lose another life."" Contact Ben Tobin at bjtobin@gannett.com and 502-582-4181 or follow on Twitter @TobinBen.

Yeah. Uh, good afternoon, Kentucky. Yesterday I met with Briana Taylor's mother before she came up here. I sat and I listened. And what I heard was a mother and pain that wants justice and the truth. She deserves both. Brianna's death, along with others across the country, have led thousands of people giving voice and a demand for truly equal treatment under the law, in the end to injustices that permeate almost every part of our society. I don't have the words or the personal experience to describe those feelings of frustration, of tiredness, of anger, especially for Americans that have waited far, far too long for change. What we saw yesterday, we saw some amazing moments. A rendition of Amazing Grace through the pain. And what we saw were demonstrations. Even after painful events. They were peaceful. And I want to ensure the people of Kentucky. No, I'm listening. As we move forward, we will be reducing our National Guard presence in Louisville. That was a recommendation by our adjective general that we will be following after the death of David McAtee. I authorized the critical incident response team of K SP to investigate. This is a unit that investigates police involved shootings all over the Commonwealth. This is what they do in Kentucky. They're the best. I've told them that it must be fast and it must be thorough. While I know today there were some videos released in any video footage out there of any type ought to be released. And I said yesterday there ought to be body cam footage there should have been. But any footage ought to be released so that people can watch it. And people can see with their own eyes and make determinations with their their own eyes. Um, in our office, our oversight of that investigation Our point person is Michael Brown. Michael is the executive Cabinet secretary. He is the highest appointed official in Kentucky. He was the justice cabin secretary for eight years, overseeing the entirety of the state police. Long, Long before that, it was ah, district judge in Jefferson County. Someone asked Michael to come up and to give a update on that ongoing investigation. After that, we will give an update on Cove in 19 and we'll take questions. Michael. Thank you, Governor. Um, as we all know, shortly after midnight on June 1st there were units of the Louisville Metro Police Department and Kentucky National Guard in the vicinity of 26th and Broadway. They had reported that there have been gunshots and that they had returned fire. We had one deceased person is the governor stated David McAtee was died at the scene. I can tell you very preliminarily the results of the first results of an autopsy seemed to indicate Mr Makati. So come to a single, we believe a single gunshot wound to the chest. But tests on bullet fragments will have to be conducted at the Kentucky State Police crime lab to see if we can determine exactly what type off bullet he was struck by at this time. We do not know that, but we do believe it was a single bullet. Following the incident, there were a number of people approximately 13 who, at the residence where Mr Makati was. They were interviewed. Many of them had samples taken gunshot residue samples, none of these results or back. Yet. They're all very new. And they were all preliminarily interviewed at that residence. We recovered a total of seven weapons, six handguns, one shotgun, the all will be undergoing certain types of tests, including tracing by a T F DNA testing. We're gonna look to see which, if any of them have been discharged. We clearly believed at least one of them was discharged and try to match up those weapons with any of the shell casings that were found in the vicinity. We obtained search warrants. Those search warrants yielded in part videos from both external cameras and internal can cameras at that location. And, in fact, as the governor alluded to video from those cameras, was released earlier today by Louisville Metro and available for review. That review will continue in great detail, frame by frame to further get a better indication of exactly what the sequence over events. And in fact, we hope to go through a very laborious practice of trying to match up those videos with any other videos that we've done either by civilian or security cameras and along with any audio video that we might have captured, say on police radios to try to truly get a true chronology of what occurred. All of the weapons that we believe were involved by the National Guard and Louisville Metro were inventory. And it is our belief at this time that approximately 18 shots were fired between the National Garden, Louisville Metro Police that evening. And again, we have collected shell casings, and those weapons are also in our custody for further testing, and they will be tested for DNA and any other thing we can get from them. We're going to be reviewing whatever Body Cam Video was a bail available audio, but I have been in contact with both the commissioner, Kentucky State Police. I had a conversation last night with the United States attorney for the Western District of Kentucky who indicated that the FBI alongside of K SP would be participating and conducting an investigation. Our goal is to get all of the facts, get them quickly and be able to present a as much as possible clearer determination, what happened again shortly after midnight on June 1st, we will be giving updates as appropriate, given the fact that this is an ongoing investigation. I cannot comment any further on the results that although then what I've given you today. Thank you. Thank you, Michael. Our commitment is the truth. No matter. Thank you, Michael. Our commitment is the truth no matter what, that truth is. Good, bad, ugly. Our commitment is the truth. That's what people of Kentucky deserve. That's what the families involved in this deserve. And that's what we're going to ensure happens. It's It's again a time in America where I hope that there is a different and better world moving forward, that hopefully everybody that's willing to listen, can hear and continue to listen and to take steps in whatever way they can in their lives to create a type of world where everybody as opportunity and nobody has to feel unsafe in their communities. Also going to give the first cove in 19 update that I've been able to give in several days, we put out a release last night that talked about Sunday's numbers, which had been down. Monday's numbers, which were up with the number of deaths, were back down today in new cases, even with a number of tests. So as Dr Stack and I were talking earlier, it's going to take 567 days to try to truly see if this was perhaps related to our testing in long term care. If we are seeing an escalation of cases. It's just gonna take a little bit of time and we want to get it right on. We don't want to give people guesses. We want to try toe, make reasonable determinations based on data. And we simply don't have enough right now to suggest that there is, um, a new bump right now. I still believe that if we are not plateau, we are decreasing. But the data is going toe. To bear that out, we're gonna have to watch and see. So today we're reporting 155 new cases 155 of Cove in 19. And once you moved duplicates and the rest, we now have a total number of cases will ever in Kentucky because many of these people have recovered and some we've lost. Of 10,185 of those 215 or probable and the rest are lab confirmed. Those cases air out of a total number of tests now of 253,585. I know we're now in the upper half of states on the total number of tests that have been run, and that's an incredible story given where we started. Total number of Kentucky has ever hospitalized 2307. Currently 481 ever in the I. C U 941 currently 85 and the numbers recovered. 3275 UM, new cases by County 46 Jefferson, 17 and Franklin, 10 and Fayette and Warren, eight, and Boone, six, and Gallatin and Canton, three, and Bullet, Campbell Harden, Mary and Pulaski, Shelby and Union to An Anderson There and Harrison. Jess Ammen knocks Logan, Perry and Woodford and one and Boil, Crittenton, Esto, Floyd, Graves, Henderson, Lawrence, Madison, Mercer, Monroe, Nelson, Pendleton and Taylor. Today we're also announcing that we've lost three additional Kentucky and springing our total loss statewide. 442. One of those is probable. The others are all confirmed included 92 year on a 92 year old man from You, Limberg, 94 year old man from Jefferson and a 69 year old woman from Clay. Let's remember that we, you know, for for a lot of reasons, let's keep lighting our homes up green. Let's continue to ring our bells at 10 a.m. Let's do it for those that we've lost from this and from senseless violence. Everybody that we've lost that should still be here, deserves that same level, have compassion. And we started it for Cove in 19. Can't wait. Show that compassion that love and that caring for every family that's suffering for every family that's going through trauma for every family that has a loved one that they won't see tomorrow. Let's make sure that we take the compassion that we have shown to our fellow human being in Cove in 19. And make sure we're showing that compassion to every human being, whether we have lost them or not. I think right now listening, compassion and action are all so very necessary. Ethnicity and race before what we're seeing and Louisville on around the country. I know this, but again was was showing, um, what inequality results in which is death. We were seeing that because of inequalities that have lasted hundreds of years and absolutely exist in our health care system, that we were losing almost twice as many black and African Americans to this virus as they represent in our population. That's not okay, It is not okay, and we're gonna do something about it. I hope later this week we're gonna announce some of our initial plans about trying to get both leaders in the African American community and the actual providers, hospital systems, Medicaid, insurers, all in the same room together not to have a task force or a study, but to see how we can actually get this done. How we can actually make change in the health of individuals. No, Just like in many ways, that shouldn't have had to take some terrible incidents around our country. Teoh wake people up or to get them to listen to the type of injustices that are occurring in our society. It shouldn't take a one in every 100 year pandemic for us to see the same in health care. So cases ethnicity 84.57% of our cove in 19 cases are non Hispanic and 15.43% are Hispanic. On race, 74.3% of cases are white, 14.5% of cases are black or African Americans, 5.37% are Asians by 0.55% are multiracial on deaths, ethnicity that's pretty much 97% non Hispanic and 3% Hispanic. And then we look at hat deaths and you got to know, I mean, not that way. Shouldn't know that it's It's wrong if the cases are disproportionate. But deaths 78.95% white 17.29% black or African American when those individuals make up 8% of the population, 2% multiracial, 1.75% Asian So it's it's ah, it's certainly a time in America Where are inequalities have been laid bare. It's gonna bay our job to make sure that that is not the case going forward. So with that will open it up toe questions. I will answer as many as we can. So the video the first time do you feel like I believe there for their? I was able to see the videos before they were released. I believe that now that they have been released, people have the opportunity to spend time watching them tow. Watch them as many times as as as they need to and and see what they see. It is only one piece of a much larger and what will be on ongoing investigation. I know what are investigators will do. What what news outlets could do is to, um, look at it frame by frame, minute by minute. But then, that's just one data point that you then have to match up to everything else that that happened and every other piece of evidence that's there. In the end, I just want the truth and trust Kentucky and went. All of the evidence is out there with the truth. Sometimes I know that I know that That's that's that's what that's what Kentucky and want. They don't want to feel like someone is telling them and not showing them the totality of the evidence. And people deserve to be able to see things on their own. I believe that everybody can can look at that video, but the video does not have audio, and so you're gonna have to line up a lot of different pieces of information there, Karen before. So we are. We are reducing our National Guard presence right now. I believe that, especially after after last night and the way it went on the night before that that was a recommendation by the Guard itself. I know that there is real sensitivity right now with the guard. I believe that the guard has been necessary that there was a potential, especially going into Saturday night where there were some real concerns and information out there, and I called them in solely to try to ensure that people were safe now going forward. Their command is now mixed in and an active part of every decision that is made that deals with the Guard and the yesterday, um, I way been really firm that the guard, especially yesterday, should should not be in the West End. It has turned out there was a group that was tied to a fire truck that Waas supposed to go wherever that went, just to provide that security on and ended up responding to the to the fire at at the gas station, which I believe are stores called Gino's shouldn't have happened. We made sure we rectified that, and that's that's that's to try to be, to try to here and to try to listen and to try to respond the right way. Uh, received information yesterday that there was footage. Now it could have been the pole camera footage. But my goodness, I mean to not have body cameras on is unacceptable. It's unacceptable, and it's gonna make it harder for folks to to accept evidence as it comes in because that should be there. I understand that, Um, it's just it's not OK, Um, but my commitment is is through the K SP investigation. We are not going to rely on a single piece of evidence. We're going to ensure that and they're doing it. They're working really fast. They are being very thorough. Everything that I have seen and then it's been reported thus far. I would tell people that I believe that we can have confidence in this investigation, but we're gonna ensure that we see that through. And I know Michael with his experience, both from overseeing all of the Kentucky State Police to his time as a district judge. We'll help us ensure that we do aren't I think the question is again on the video and I just believe that that is one piece of evidence and there are numerous others that they will get. They haven't done ballistics yet or it's an in process and I just believe that it is really important. First on a video that everybody has time to watch it and to digest it without me telling you what I think it shows. I mean, everybody else has has eyes and ought to be able to look at that Andi on. Then there's still so many other questions that that are out there and then and then have to be answered roughly. Yeah, from A From a public safety standpoint, we're not gonna disclose the numbers of guards, men or women as the forces reduced. You know, we believe that there will be a a sufficient amount their toe where if if the worst happens, something that nobody wants, violence was was created, which I do not believe has happened to do Any of those that are that are out there intending to give voice. But if people did try to hijack those protests that there would be at least a presence to ensure that that doesn't happen. But again, what we're seeing right now has been a very peaceful instead of demonstrations with with some criminal activity and the looting that there wasn't connected to any of that. And so I know. I guess it's I guess it's It was called looting last night from the crash. That was somebody breaking in and stealing stuff. I don't believe that that was connected in any way to any demonstration. Some, you know, I know. I've heard the word looting right now that's associated with these demonstrations. I'm like, That's fair. I like that. That's accurate. But my hope is that we'll be able to fully reduce the guards presence in the very, very near future. Morgan. Okay. You know, the Kentucky State Police isn't gonna isn't gonna make you claim about what the video shows until they've been able to collect all of the evidence and put it all together. The question is, do I think it was a mistake to call up the National Guard? Do I think that there any mistakes made by the National Guard way we need to see the evidence? You know, I believe that the National Guard is a highly trained group of individuals on day are remember they're there. They're not just some military out there. There are neighbors right there. Our friends there, people who work regular jobs and then are called up toe service. We're gonna get all the information on bake Sure that we're able toe put it out. But I have a high degree of confidence in our guard. But if mistakes were made well own up to them, The guard does that too. We gotta make sure, though, that all all the evidence gets in on then we'll we'll move forward. Yeah, Warm weapons. You just I think those facts are still developing and are part of an ongoing investigation Where questions they're still being asked eso we don't have any additional information on the weapons found inside the house to disclose. I know that we had a significant number of claims processed. I don't have the unemployment information here with you. We will get that in writing. I know that we had an uptick in unemployment claims over the last week. My belief is that we're going to see that decreased substantially as we have had more openings, just like we've had today. You know, I believe that especially as we move towards a vaccine and hopefully we will see one that our economy can bounce back. But this is an opportunity. I mentioned this yesterday. This is an opportunity for a changed America. After events like this, this significant America has been different. Our economy has been different. Our society should be different. And this is an opportunity to build a more resilient economy, one that mirrors the times that we live in and a more equitable economy as well. My hope is that as we change, especially in Seo providers, that there is a really opportunity for jobs, especially in the West end of Louisville, as has been pledged by one of these groups, and that we with the time and the opportunity ought to do the job training. We ought to do that also in that community with groups that can do it. Um, this is, I might sound try. This is our chance toe to build a better world and right now where we're hearing the demand for it, not the need, the demand, and we're also seeing the desperate need for it in these covert numbers. I believe that Mayor Fisher right now is working to rebuild relationships to communicate with community leaders. I know he spent much of today doing that, trying to ensure that they had their questions answered, but it's one structure No one structure way. Need to look into body camps for the Kentucky State Police. If I remember, the issue came up before and it was cost of servers I believe was was an issue. Though I wasn't directly involved in that. It's something. It's something that we need to look at. Yes, and we absolutely need to look at it Got down? Yes. Now the restriction on door to door sales is still in place. Waken look at the schedule a ZRA moving forward but it is it is still in place Morning way Don't have any more information on on on that particular that set of information at the moment. What? The question is, what is my message from people or groups that are coming in for out of state for these demonstrations? And if we've been able to identify groups are intelligence that we received say that we've got groups from out of town, they're coming in to demonstrate right alongside those Kentucky and that are giving voice, um, to justice. Uh, we also have some intelligence that there are those present that want to incite violence where everybody would get hurt and that their goal is that everybody is hurt thes air folks that want to hijack something that is is peaceful and is seeking a better world and trying to turn it into something violent. And we want to ensure that that doesn't happen. Much of what we have seen and or heard is anecdotal. We have certainly seen footage of, you know, an individual dressed head to toe and black, almost tactical gear just walking down the street with a hammer, breaking every window. I believe that that's an attempt to make our demonstrations look like they're causing property damage at a time when they weren't when, well, police about this earlier today. The investigation do you eso el MPD has certain protocols in place about what information they talk about it any given time on. And maybe those protocols need to be looked at. What I think they're doing is is following them for us. I made some very specific commitments, and so our goal is where we can without compromising reinvestigation is to try to share information as we go, but to share it without, um conclusion because this is still ongoing. And I believe that all the evidence has to speak together on I believe by the end, when we pull everything together, hopefully we have a clear picture that we can show people on by. My hope is that can provide us as much context. It's possible now will say that I believe when video footage is found, it ought to be put out there. It ought to be put out there so people can see it on evaluated. Onda contacts absolutely will need to be added to it. Askew. Go. It's again. It's just one piece of evidence. But I believe especially with something that people can see with their own eyes, we need to be transparent. We need to put it out. And I believe that's that. That's one thing that one of the reasons But it was done today. Karen. Yes, please is so caring. Read a statement of ah of ah, of a protester of a demonstrator. Um, and you can tell it's it's very, very wrong, right? And I say that in a positive way. And, um giving voice to to frustration Onda lack of faith on government moving forward. All I can do is work every single day to try to create a little bit of that faith you mentioned before when? When I became governor and have been governor for about six months. Uh, has as I stand here tonight we were We were taking a number of steps. Now they're not enough and restoring voting rights want enough? We should have that constitutional amendment just still want to push for ensuring that we had expanded Medicaid and people weren't getting kicked off its not enough. But it was a step trying to build a a cabinet that reflects our our state again. Not enough, but but a step. But I think what we're hearing is small steps are not enough. Onda. We need to see significant substantial change, and I want to be a partner in that. But it's it's gonna take that proof. It's gonna take action. I understand that on, but I'll work hard toe toe to create that, to take those steps to make sure that the belief isn't based on on blind faith. That's based on what people see what people here and what actually happens there. I mean, the president's statements about bringing in the military are are not appropriate, and they are not helpful. I don't know if he's speaking out of frustration, but what we have seen here in Kentucky No. Now he should not do it. Um, while I hope that we ultimately come out of this and going forward, handle things appropriately, We do not need the federal government coming in here on taking any of those actions. Well, I think that the term looting the question is about talking about the looting at Kroger. It's one of its right now. We're to the time where certain words air tied emotionally, two different things that are occurring. And right now I think if you say that the Kroger was was was looted, the people think that it was connected to demonstrations and it wasn't, he asked. People went in and they took things on the yes that breaks the law. But this was This was in a way, almost like burglarizing the facility. I just want to make sure that I am very clear that I do not believe it's related to the demonstrations. I believe, in fact, that the demonstrators very much would not want that to happen. I believe that that's an institution that's important for the food supply of that community on. I want to make sure that I'm careful, in my words, to say that this was a separate criminal act. In no way related to the demonstrations were seeing Tom, please. Which tweets? Yeah, I think the I think the question is about the president's tweets on the demonstrations. I can say that the way that resolved is not the right word, the way too. I believe the way for someone like me and to try toe to try to address what's going on is to listen, um, toe, open my ears to try to here and to the degree I can understand and that words of force words violence are not appropriate are not. What we're hearing is the pain and anger that runs deeper than I could ever understand. And to respond to that with with the words of force or violence isn't isn't listening. Yeah, I think that when we talk about change, Onda widespread change that's needed its its economic and I think that we have on opportunity in front of us. That should just be one of a number of opportunities we take. It's in health care where, especially with the number of hospitals and other providers in Louisville. I think wanting to make key investments, I believe that we should be able to make a difference there. And it's also in our justice system. And that's got to go everywhere, from our policing to our incarceration rates to the revocation of of of voting rights to inequality and what charges result in in what sentences have to make sure that there isn't a difference in who is paroled or probated because of the color of their skin and and in our policing, I mean, I think that this all across the country and says that this isn't an individual feeling like they are unsafe. This is This is a major part of our society that Andi shouldn't accept a world where we know the people feel unsafe around those who are hired to keep us all safe. Eso I believe we've got a look at all of the concerns that air there. We got a look at all the practices, and when something happens like it did in Louisville to Briana Taylor like it did in Minnesota, you you gotta look at policies. You gotta look at changing things. You, they don't want a tragedy toe toe have to teach you something that should be different. But if a tragedy happens, you gotta learn from it. It can't repeat it. The question is on pro testing and covert 19 Cove. It is still out there. It's still spreads aggressively. It can still be be deadly. Um, so I would ask. People do do your best to be safe. I know that what's happening right now is important. And I know this community takes cove it very seriously, which just shows you how important what's being said and demonstrated truly is eso. Please wear a mask. Most people are you could cut better compliance and in these demonstrations than than we do just about anywhere. Please try to spread out if and when you can. Obviously, they're occurring outdoors, which is helpful from a covert perspective. And if you can and he will please try to avoid, for the time being some of our seniors and those that have underlying health conditions. If you if you've been at one of these demonstrations, I know that if you're at one of these demonstrations, you're looking for a just safe world for everybody. So Let's make sure we take care off, especially those that are especially susceptible. DeKoven 19. I'll do one more quick round. So yesterday. I believe that one of the questions that needs to be answered or the facts that need to come out are all the reasons behind why the L. A. P D. And the Guard was called to the to the dean owes area that night again, I trust Kentucky and that we need to make sure that we have all the facts behind it and we lay them in front of them again. I think that that people want the truth, whether the truth is good, bad or ugly. Giving people the truth is the right thing to do on. They can process it. I don't know how much longer the curfew is going to go forward. I believe that's still intended to keep everybody safe again. With with where tensions might be at asked that the people who are gonna demonstrate if you're willing to please do so during the day on and make sure that that again everybody can stay safe, that's that's the first pieces of information that I have, but we need to look at where the order came from, what the dispatch was about, I think all that's got to come out in the investigation. So care so, frequency of testing, my hope would be people would consider it at least monthly. Given that this is out there and given that we're going back to work and depending on how much contact you've had with other people, I would do it more often than that. Onda. We've got more testing capacity than we have ever had. I mean, you look at now 250 something 1000 Cove. It tests if we can continue our pace that we're on right now and it will certainly help us restoring our economy more safely. Like we're looking at that one thing that that, uh, that I'm also trying to do that with Briana Taylor's mom is toe give people not just Teoh questions are what I could do moving forward. But what I can do right now and trying to if I can use my voice or the means of projecting it on and and and the ability for Brianna's mom and others to speak to an entire state and if people are watching an entire nation doubling down one national interview since this started, It was on CNN on Guy spent the majority of it reading from a statement from to make a Briana's mom. If one of the things that I can do is help magnify voices, then it's something that I want to be able to do. I don't have a plan visit at the moment parts. The question is on 1/6 Circuit ruling, I'm a start. One other place. There was a Supreme Court ruling just the other day that ruled that generally these restrictions, with some limitations that governors have put into place, are in fact legal. This was out of California. We believe that it is a ruling that will ultimately result in a favorable ruling. In each of the challenges to the restrictions we've had to put in place for Cove in 19 you have that, um, a bit of text up. We think that it's ah, a bit of text that basically says during these times, the executive branch has toe have latitude to address a worldwide health pandemic on that a court, and this is their works. The Supreme Court of unelected Judges that shouldn't be second guessing it. So we've submitted that decision to the, uh, the federal courts that have our case is now the sixth Circuit recently overturned a Kentucky law on the topic of abortion. I believe that it followed what the Supreme Court has has been saying what the low has been for for the last several decades. I was not surprised about it from that standpoint. In fact, you saw some pro life legislators in the Legislature vote against it because they believe that the law out there from the Supreme Court was so strong and so clear, Tom. But way almost none of them are fully over. Basically, all the court cases on restrictions were about these temporary restraining orders. They're called temporary because the case isn't isn't over. We believe that the Supreme Court case will answer most all of the questions that have been asked and even talk about whether a court should be hearing and trying to make a different decision. Um, then then we've made I believe we've made good decisions aimed at protecting people, and now we're trying to make wise decisions moving forward on reopening our economy while trying to do it safely. I believe those of the cases. I believe we might have gotten sued by a putt putt facility, but I believe that falls along the same grounds. And I believe that one was in federal court to Yeah, I think we've got to a sui as we look at at actions taken. Look at each instance, and I think we should always be evaluating this where something like tear gas is is used. We've got a evaluate and continue to evaluate Teoh do better in the future. With Govan 19 out there, it certainly raises additional concerns. Andi, certainly I know that there have been those. Andi shouldn't just have to be elected officials, right? But elected officials that want to discuss that policy based on their own personal experiences on and that's a discussion that absolutely should happen. All right, last one, I'm not personally spoken to the to the new head of lmp D, but I know our Commissioner of the State Police has been doing so directly on. I think I've also been really clear that the Kentucky State Police and this unit has the independence. I believe the objectivity and the training to do this right. And it is in everybody's best interest that they have the ability to do that to bring, um so that people can can hopefully have some faith in some trust. And I know that's in short supply right now, but given that the one of the concerns going back to Briana Taylor is about the independence of the investigation, that that is really important for this incident that that just happened early yesterday morning. So we're gonna continue to have a significant presence in that investigation. I will make sure that that ultimately the facts air laid out there for the people of Kentucky, all right, to those that are going to give voice again tonight, Please be safe. Um, I want to make sure that that that as governor, I do everything that I can to hear and to listen. And I know that's only part. And then it's got to be toe act. Um, the question was asked earlier about people having lost faith, do everything I can to rebuild it. We ought to in a Post Cove in 19 world, which we will get to strive for a better world for a different world one in every 100 year pandemic shouldn't be required for it to happen night. Nor should the incidents that we've seen. But we know our world is gonna be different moving forward. So let's make it better. Thank you.

Blevins recently ran in Clermont County for House of Representatives Republican Caucus. This marked the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police. (Photo: Amanda Rossmann, The Enquirer/Amanda Rossmann) Dillon Blevins lives in Republican-rich Clermont County, just east of Cincinnati. When he ran for state representative this year, his slogan was ""God, guns and Trump."" The 29-year-old white Republican joined a protest in Cincinnati on Tuesday. After a group of demonstrators marched from the Hamilton County Courthouse to the jail, and then back to the courthouse, they passed around a megaphone. A teacher spoke, saying she worried the next George Floyd could be one of her students. A nurse yelled about police brutality, saying ""I don't hurt my patients."" A young woman cried, and said she was here because her friend couldn't be. Her friend had been arrested. A line started to form for the microphone. For people to address the sheriff's deputies standing outside. For people to vent. For people to be heard. One black man held up his phone, which he said showed a picture of a time when he was hurt by police during an arrest. Another said he understood talk about a peaceful protest, but ""all we want is a peaceful life."" Then Blevins stepped forward. He was wearing a camouflage hat, jeans and a T-shirt. He had a gun holstered in his waistband. He said he would be quick. A few years ago, Blevins told the crowd, he was someone who felt Colin Kaepernick was disrespecting the military. Blevins told them he was someone who didn't understand the anger African Americans felt toward police. He didn't understand racial inequality. ""I'm being woken up,"" he said. Blevins, who lost his GOP primary in April, protested last month in Columbus. He wanted to reopen Ohio. When he posted on Facebook this week, defending the protests that have erupted across the country after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, he said people defriended him. He said people made excuses for the police. Outside the courthouse on Tuesday afternoon, Blevins took a knee with the crowd. Protesters kneel together in front of the Hamilton County Courthouse on June 2. This marked the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police. (Photo: Amanda Rossmann, The Enquirer/Amanda Rossmann) It was the fifth day of protests in downtown Cincinnati and Over-the-Rhine. It was hot, more than 90 degrees. And, as it did on Monday, the day began with long lines at the Hamilton County Justice Center. Dozens of people gathered there Tuesday morning, cheering when a protester was released. One man started to walk away, and people started yelling for him to stop. There was a table set up with bananas, oranges and stacks of water bottles. ""We've got water,"" they said. The police chief estimated 40-50 people had been arrested for curfew violations on Monday. The day before that, 307 protesters were arrested. On Tuesday, after some consideration, the curfew in Cincinnati was extended to 8 p.m. Around noon, deputies stood outside the courthouse, not in riot gear but their typical uniform. Protesters stand together in front of the Hamilton County Courthouse on June 2 where several sheriff's deputies stood outside. This marked the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police. (Photo: Amanda Rossmann, The Enquirer/Amanda Rossmann) Before the large crowd formed, Iris Roley sat down in front of the courthouse. Roley is a black business owner who has dedicated her life to activism surrounding police reform. She's probably best known for her role in the Collaborative Agreement, which has reshaped the way the Cincinnati Police Department polices, and for the efforts that led to that. ""This hurts my soul,"" she told The Enquirer. ""I wish I didn't have to be out here."" She worries about the coronavirus, and she wore a ""Justice for Ahmaud"" facemask. Ahmaud Arbery was a 25-year-old black man shot while jogging in a coastal Georgia neighborhood in February. She also worries the demonstrations can overshadow the work she and others are still doing. Roley, who spoke at a demonstration on Saturday, said she was here to talk to the young people. To educate them. To help them. On Tuesday, she told her husband back at home she wouldn't be long. When the crowd started to march, she grabbed a sign. Protesters march together around the Hamilton County Courthouse on June 2. This marked the fifth day of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police.

Groups rallied in front of the courthouse on Tuesday afternoon and then marched to Washington Park and City Hall. Later that night, 10 people were arrested for curfew violations.

The demonstrations over the death of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor, an unarmed black woman shot during a police raid in March, were mostly peaceful. But a spree of vandalism and looting damaged businesses downtown and in selected locations around the city. Here is his first-person account, first posted on Facebook, of what happened: I have always been an advocate for the fair treatment and equal rights for all individuals. As a member of a minority group because of my sexual orientation, and having been the chairman for the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights for 10 years, I have an understanding of the need to expose and work for change in regards to inequality and unwarranted oppression. Through several decades, I have been the owner and developer of several downtown businesses. Over 20 years ago, I had a dream of recapturing a bygone vibrant Fourth Street. Successfully contributing to that dream, I developed the old Kentucky Theater on Fourth Street into a multi-business facility with a Bagel & Coffee shop, Marketplace restaurant, Theater Square Wine & Spirits, a yoga studio and also law offices. On Friday evening I experienced what I have never experienced. I watched as an attempt to destroy the dream took place. A protest started out with a tone of peaceful demonstration. It was heartwarming to see the hundreds of people that supported the rightful cause. You may like: Downtown Louisville may be cleaned up, but you can't power wash away 'Justice for Breonna' However, individuals bearing hammers, baseball bats, and who knows what else they had in their backpacks, had absolutely no intention of keeping it a focused and peaceful demonstration. I view those individuals that were in the black Ninja outfits and toting weapons as nothing more than opportunist vandals and thieves. Along with many other businesses and properties in downtown Louisville, our property and business — The Marketplace Restaurant and Theater Square Wine and Spirits — were vandalized and looted. I was notified by the alarm company that the alarm at the Marketplace Wine Shop was going off. I rushed to the Wine Shop to find the large storefront windows busted out, (with) groups of masked individuals crawling in and out of the windows with hands and arms filled with bottles of wine, spirits and other merchandise. The individuals were not just one gender or one race. However, It did seem that the majority were juveniles or young adults. I started grabbing the product from their hands. As I went to grab a basket that one of them had filled with product, I was attacked from the back and knocked to the ground by two others. Two African American men persuaded the men to stop their attack on me. Bleeding, sore and fearing for my life, I retreated to the car and locked the doors as I watched the destruction and thievery by hooded, masked thieves continue. Read this: Mayor Fischer says Louisville welcomes peaceful protest. Why was one cleared with tear gas? There was nothing I could do. I finally left and went home leaving the devastation physically, but mentally it wouldn’t leave my mind. I got very little sleep. George Stinson, who owns Marketplace restaurant and nearby shops on Fourth Street, got a needed assist from two men as he tried unsuccessfully to stop looters last weekend. (Photo: Courtesy of George Stinson) In the morning, I went back to Marketplace and got the full picture of the destruction. It was major damage and major theft. I called to have the building secured and boarded up. I started sweeping up the broken glass. Amid all of this horribleness, I looked up and saw strangers, various races and ages, with dustpans and brooms in their hands, going to businesses asking if they could help in the cleanup. These were the local Louisvillians wanting to help. This hit me right in the heart. This was the Louisville that I have always known and loved. Yes, the experience was horrific, but the care and concern shown by my fellow Louisvillians gave me that hope again that we will continue to get through trying situations together. To those kind individuals, thank you for caring.

Police Department WASHINGTON (AP) — American cities erupted in violence and destruction in a seventh straight night of unrest, with several police officers shot or run over, amid boasts and threats from President Donald Trump to send in troops to “dominate the streets.” In New York, nonviolent protests Monday night were punctuated by people smashing shop windows near Rockefeller Center and breaching the doors of Macy’s flagship store on 34th Street, littering the pavement with broken glass. An SUV plowed into a group of officers at a demonstration in Buffalo, injuring three, including a state trooper who suffered a broken leg and a shattered pelvis. Demonstrations also broke out in such places as Philadelphia, where hundreds of protesters spilled onto a highway in the heart of the city; Atlanta, where police fired tear gas at demonstrators; and Nashville, where more than 60 National Guard members put down their riot shields at the request of peaceful protesters who had gathered in front of Tennessee’s Capitol to honor George Floyd. Bystander Sean Jones, who watched as people ransacked luxury stores in New York over the weekend, said: “People are doing this so next time, before they think about trying to kill another black person, they’re going to be like, ’Damn, we don’t want them out here doing this ... again.’” The unrest in Minneapolis appeared to stabilize on the same day Floyd’s brother made an impassioned plea for peace at the spot where a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, put his knee on the handcuffed black man’s neck until he stopped breathing last week. Chauvin has been charged with murder. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Tuesday that prosecutors were working as fast as they can to determine if the three other officers at the scene should be charged, too. All four have been fired. The death toll from the unrest rose to at least nine, including two people killed in a Chicago suburb. More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press. Cities struggled to keep police in line and avoid instances of excessive force. The police chief in Louisville, Kentucky, was fired after a beloved restaurant owner was killed by police and National Guard members enforcing a curfew. In Richmond, Virginia, the police chief said officers who used tear gas on a group of peaceful protesters would be disciplined. An officer was shot shortly before midnight near the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas. Police had no immediate word on the officer’s condition. Four officers were shot in St. Louis; they were expected to recover. Trump, meanwhile, portrayed himself as a hard-nosed, law-and-order president, with police under federal command using tear gas to clear peaceful demonstrators from a park near the White House so that he could walk to a church and pose with a Bible. Emerging after two days out of public view, he threatened from the White House Rose Garden to deploy “thousands and thousands” of U.S. troops. Full Coverage: America Protests The photo op at the house of worship known as the Church of the Presidents was condemned by Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. “The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for,” she said. For nearly a week since Floyd’s death, largely peaceful protests by day have turned to chaos at night. “We have been sitting on a powder keg for some time and it has burst,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. Trump warned that if governors don’t deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers to “dominate the streets,” the U.S. military will step in to “quickly solve the problem for them.” “We have the greatest country in the world,” the president declared. “We’re going to keep it safe.” As Trump spoke, tear gas canisters could be heard exploding. A military deployment by Trump to U.S. states would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. It drew comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate in the aftermath of riots following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Trump made little effort to address the grievances of black Americans and others outraged by Floyd’s death and the scourge of police brutality, undermining what his reelection campaign had hoped would be increased appeal to African American voters. Federal law allows presidents to dispatch the military into states to suppress an insurrection or if a state is defying federal law, legal experts said. But officials in New York and other states asserted that the president does not have a unilateral right to send in troops against the will of local governments.",0.0

House Democrats are sorting through dozens of proposals to address policing issues, including excessive use of force and racial profiling. ""It is time, it is time for us to address the concerns that were being expressed by the protesters,"" Pelosi said at a press event at the Capitol Tuesday. ""This is not a single incident. We know this is a pattern of behavior. and we also know the history that brings us to this sad place."" Democrats hope to calm the increasingly incendiary atmosphere in the country over Floyd's death by finding ways to address the underlying systemic problems enraging protesters in the streets. There is some degree of bipartisan support for reviewing the tactics that led to Floyd's death. Many Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have acknowledged what McConnell called ""egregious wrongs."" McConnell said Tuesday there could be a role for Congress to play here. ""It's certainly something that we need to take a look at,"" McConnell told reporters. ""We'll be talking to our colleagues about what, if anything, is appropriate for us to do in the wake of what's going on."" But the discussion has often become entwined with public outcry over President Trump's handling of the unrest and his threat to use military force to quell protests. Pelosi said Floyd's killing ""happened in broad daylight, it happened for all the world to see. A knee to the neck, not only by the perpetrator of that murder but by three officers observing it."" Congress has often struggled to address policing issues. Many decisions about policing tactics, training and strategies are determined at the state and local level. Pelosi is asking members of the Congressional Black Caucus to sort through the ideas and find legislation that can pass the House where Democrats have enough votes for approval without GOP support. Among the options is a 2015 bill introduced by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that would outlaw the use of chokeholds in policing. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has endorsed that idea. Democrats are hoping to reach an agreement quickly. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters he could call lawmakers back to Washington to vote before their scheduled return on June 30. Hoyer said that he has been in contact with the Congressional Black Caucus over the last four days and that it is considering more than 50 pieces of legislation, including a proposal to end qualified immunity for police officers, or their legal protection shield for certain actions. Democrats also plan to try to force the Senate to go on record condemning Trump for ""ordering federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against Americans who were peaceably protesting"" Monday outside the White House. The resolution, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would also affirm the rights of free assembly and protest while condemning looting. The measure is unlikely to pass as it requires unanimous consent to be approved. Republicans, including McConnell, have largely focused on calling for protests to remain peaceful without directly discussing the conflict at the White House. ""It is well past time that we also unite on the side of peace in our streets and peace in our communities,"" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""We need to unite against these violent rioters who seek only to aggrandize themselves and further damage a nation that needs healing."" Most Senate Republicans declined Tuesday to discuss the tear gas incident at the White House when reporters on Capitol Hill asked them about it. Some avoided the question; others said they didn't see the incident. Those who did speak to reporters mostly focused on condemning violent protests. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has announced a June 16 hearing on police use of force. ""We intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd's death, with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation,"" Graham said in a statement Friday. ",0.0

(Photo: Sam Greene) I heard from my sons within the same hour on Sunday. My oldest, Tim, is 24 and a member of the Ohio National Guard. His unit had just been activated and he was on his way to Cleveland for riot control. Colin is 22 and is, among other things, a photographer who was headed downtown to document and participate in the protests. Tim Shimrock (Photo: Provided) They were both headed into areas where the tensions were inflamed and, therefore, unpredictable. Outside of being proud of them both for enlisting in the struggle, being the change they want to see in the world, I was agitated that my children were going to be in harm’s way because other people had created a situation full of muck and uncertainty. “White allies to the front,” Colin was told at the protest. He and his young friends stood between the police and the people of color while they walked. A barrier both emblematic and real. Colin Shimrock (Photo: Provided) I’ve been in prisons since 2002, as a chaplain, as a college instructor and now as a reentry facilitator. I’ve put in the hours, unraveled under resourced lives; I’ve taught and been taught about the struggles and the view from the places and perspectives I can only hear about, not experience viscerally. I’ve asked the questions and examined the choices that emerge when people feel suffocated on one side of the spectrum, entitled on the other. I don’t know what it’s like to feel a lifetime of cultural tinnitus; I have, however, done much time in the foxhole and that is what informs my conclusions in the war room. And my impatience with the ""bums."" “They’re just bums,” Curtis Crump said to me. “Everyone knows violence begets violence and stealing is stealing. It’s ignorant.” Curtis Crump is among my favorite people. When he brings his 6-foot-9, 300-pound self into the room, he brings a similarly sized vat of enthusiasm with him. He’s spent most of his 40 years in South Linden, an area of Columbus that parallels Over-the-Rhine in Cincinnati. The last four of those 40 he spent in prison where purpose, Damascus and God took root somewhere inside him. He recently joined Damascus, a reentry and staffing solution for individuals with felony records headquartered in Cincinnati, as an intern in the Columbus office. He, like me, has little patience for the people who chant for justice while paying the pain forward. “Many people just want to be involved in the drama,” Curtis said. “There’s a lot of perping going on out there. ‘Look at me on social media.’ It’s opportunistic and it’s fake.” Curtis Crump (Photo: Provided) Let’s review: Police officer makes a ridiculous decision – likely not remotely close to his first of that kind – that leads to a black man’s death. It is tragic and unacceptable, we all agree. People gather and protest to mark their unwillingness to live silently in a society that would believe for one second that that a person’s skin color should determine their treatment and safety in the larger society. We all agree. People smash windows and set buildings on fire as an outlet for the anger and hopelessness they feel as the ""other,"" the voiceless, and the oppressed. OK, I’m still with you a smidge because when you feel that those in authority are part of the problem, the ""solutions"" narrow. Living on the margins is taxing and tiresome and sometimes people reach a breaking point that not everyone understands. Some of us are still in agreement. Break into a Target, fill a shopping cart with bed linens, electronics and Jordans for the little ones? Nah, we’re done. “It’s an excuse,” Curtis said. “Everybody is out there acting thirsty and it makes everyone trying to do something different look bad. And the worst part is everybody already knew they were going to do that.” “That” is looting. Stealing. Tearing stuff up, setting things on fire, breaking into places, and taking what isn’t theirs to take. In the name of justice. As a citizen, as a taxpayer, as a prison reentry facilitator, as a mother whose two sons are now responding to the situation that is lined with harrowing truth that something could go way wrong on a dime, I refuse to grind the narratives together as if George Floyd’s death is a Fastpass for entitlement and destruction. Be angry. Demand justice. Exercise the right to protest. Vote people in or out. Create a coalition, committee, neighborhood circle or social media frenzy. Get up early, stay up late, make signs, educate the privileged. But tear up the neighborhood and bring a new 75-inch television home to the fam? You’re part of the problem. As the full-page photos and homemade videos expose the ignorance, our ability to convince employers and society to hire, trust and believe in marginalized populations grows harder than it already was. As my own children place and get placed inside the battleground where those who seek true justice are intertwined with those who use their peer’s death as an excuse to tear up and terrorize a community, my support for an important fight wavers. When the looting starts, the rooting stops. I’ll see you in prison, friends. We can start the conversation there that someone should have had with you a long time ago.

David McAtee died after being shot at by LMPD officers and Kentucky National Guardsmen at 12:15 a.m. at the corner of 26th and Broadway in west Louisville. Police say law enforcement was there to disperse a crowd that had gathered after curfew, and that officers fired after someone in the crowd shot at them first. Later that day, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced there was no police body camera video of the shooting. Fischer, who a week prior announced it would be mandatory for all LMPD officers to wear and activate body cameras, fired LMPD Chief Steve Conrad stating “a failure of this magnitude cannot be ignored.” The two LMPD officers involved in the shooting were identified as Katie Crews and Austin Allen. In addition to the shooting investigation, Crews is also being investigated for a post made to social media prior to the shooting. The post includes a photograph from a protest. In the photo, Crews declines to accept a small bouquet of flowers from a protester. Crews captioned the photo with the following:“She was saying and doing a lot more than ‘offering flowers’ to me. Just so for it to be known. For anyone that knows me and knows that my facial expression tells everything. P.S. I hope the pepper balls that she got lit up with a little later on hurt. Come back and get ya some more ole girl, I’ll be on the line again tonight.” Crews’ Facebook account appears to have been set to private or deleted, but a screen grab has been shared hundreds of times on social media. LMPD’s acting chief Rob Schroeder addressed the issue Monday night. When asked about it, Schroeder said he was made aware of the post earlier in the day and says the department’s professional standards unit is looking into the matter.According to LMPD’s Standard Operating Procedures social media policy, “speech made public by employees pursuant to their official duties is not protected by the First Amendment from employer discipline. Members should be cognizant of the fact that they are responsible, and may be held accountable, for any and all speech, posts, etc. made by them relating to, or as a result of, their employment.”Crews is not the only officer being investigated for controversial social media posts about the recent protests in Louisville. LMPD spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington confirmed to WLKY that they are looking into another Facebook post allegedly made by Officer Tim King, under the pseudonym Tim Kingfish.“Well… I can see there’s no way I can defend myself anymore and there’s no point in trying to reason with you. I am a Police Officer in Louisville: I’ll just say what I have to say. Since I have been the Police I have recovered kidnapped children, found lost elderly people from burning cars, helped domestic violence victims and sexual assault victims, resuscitated people who have overdosed. I have also written about ten tickets for reckless driving, arrested non-compliant sexual predators. I am also super pissed and very tired of this bourgeois-nonsense. So as for “the only good cop is a dead cop.” I’ll say this. I’ll be downtown tonight. If killing me is something that would make you all feel better come and try it out. In fact, I dare, I double dare you. I am strong and well trained, I will be difficult to kill. I will not allow you to harm my colleagues, myself or anyone else. As to the coming revolution. I’ve done war before. I hate it: I hate the fear, I hate the physical and mental stress of the training that is required to survive it. I hate the human cost and suffering of it. I was an excellent soldier and I have not forgotten. The idea that it is something that you would intentionally make come into the life of people I care about, to fulfill this make believe worked that you envision for all of us to live in. Whether we like it or not is totally repugnant.”The post goes on, but WLKY does not have access to the remainder of the post. Someone commented on King’s post urging the officer to stand with protesters. King responded saying:“I have nothing to prove to naïve fools You cannot wish for my death, threaten war, support hurting working people of the city, and expect me to come to your side. I would rather die. You don’t want justice, you want revenge. You want revenge on a society that rewards hard work when you are lazy. You want to throw away courts and lynch all who you view as a problem. You and many like you believed that you are special, and somehow have a birthright to things you have not earned. You fantasize about using violence to take from others who worked hard and done the work. I would rather die than be apart of that. The message you stand for is a false God, I would rather die that worship it. After what has happened over the last week, you and those like you will be my enemy now and forever. I would rather die than surrender to this madness.”On Sunday night, hours before the shooting death of David McAtee, King again took to social media saying, “Yo, are we fighting tonight?” Another LMPD officer allegedly responded saying, “to the death.”",0.0

Andy Beshear said Tuesday that he will reduce the Kentucky National Guard's presence in Louisville, where its military members have been assisting police officers during protests against police brutality and racism that started last week. The governor's announcement came the day after David McAtee, a black restaurant owner, was killed early Monday morning in a shooting that involved members of the National Guard and Louisville Metro Police. After McAtee died, many people in the city publicly grieved and protested his death. ""What we saw yesterday — we saw some amazing moments. A rendition of 'Amazing Grace' through the pain,"" Beshear said Tuesday afternoon during a press conference. ""And what we saw were demonstrations even after painful events that were peaceful, and I want to ensure the people of Kentucky know I'm listening."" He said the decision to decrease the guard's presence in Louisville is based on a recommendation from its adjutant general. He indicated a ""sufficient amount"" of guard members will remain in the city for now but did not provide specifics.

""I believe that the guard has been necessary ... and I called them in solely to try to ensure that people were safe."" Beshear and J. Michael Brown, the state's Executive Cabinet secretary, also provided new details Tuesday about the investigation of the shooting being conducted by a team from the Kentucky State Police. Based on KSP's investigation so far, Brown said the first results of an autopsy indicate McAtee, who died at the scene at 26th Street and West Broadway, was killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest. However, Brown said tests on bullet fragments must be conducted to determine what type of bullet struck McAtee. ""At this time, we do not know that,"" he said. Brown said about 13 people who were with McAtee were interviewed, and many of them had gunshot residue samples taken, the results of which aren't back yet. He also said it appears guard members and LMPD officers collectively fired about 18 shots. The weapons involved have been inventoried and are being tested. ""Our goal is to get all of the facts, get them quickly and be able to present a — as much as possible — clear determination of what happened,"" he said. State police obtained search warrants that yielded camera footage that LMPD released Tuesday, Brown said, and those videos are being examined. ""That review will continue in great detail, frame by frame,"" he said. Louisville police officials said Tuesday afternoon that the camera footage, which the police department publicly released, appears to show McAtee fired a gun before officers and guard members fired their weapons. Beshear stressed more evidence still has to be gathered. ""The Kentucky State Police isn't going to make a claim about what the video shows until they've been able to collect all of the evidence and put it all together,"" he said.

We will not support a platform that incites violence, racism and lives hashtag black lives matter. Frank told CNBC the companies were in final negotiations on a six figure content partnership is at his company would have netted hundreds of thousands of dollars in the deal, which would have provided free therapy to some users. But Frank said he'd be willing to reopen discussions if Facebook improved its methods for moderating content. In the wake of the protests surrounding George Floyd's death, Trump shared a post saying. When the looting starts, the shooting starts. Twitter added labels saying it violated Twitter's rules about glorifying violence and move. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg openly disagreed with telling Fox News. I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbitrator of truth of everything that people say online. On Monday, there was a virtual walk out among Facebook employees who felt Trump's post violated their platform standards Advertisement Tensions rise among Facebook staff as Mark Zuckerberg gives explanation for inaction on President Trump posts Share Shares Copy Link Copy Video above: Facebook loses deal over its reaction to trump ‘looting’ post, employees stage virtual walkoutFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought Tuesday to ease employee outrage over his inaction on incendiary remarks recently posted by President Donald Trump.During a company-wide town hall, Zuckerberg struggled to explain his decision-making process as many of his employees, using a real-time feedback tool, reminded him of promises to remove content that calls for violence or that could lead to imminent physical harm.""It's crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us,"" Brandon Dail, an engineer at Facebook, tweeted as the town hall was taking place.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN Business that open and honest discussion ""has always been a part of Facebook's culture.""""Mark had an open discussion with employees today, as he has regularly over the years,"" Stone said. ""He's grateful for their feedback.""The meeting has threatened to ratchet up tensions at Facebook, which has been hit with allegations of right-wing bias from conservatives and criticized by others for tacitly condoning the spread of hate and racism.Another Facebook employee told CNN Business they found Zuckerberg's answers to staff questions at the town hall lacking, and said the CEO risked alienating more of his staff rather than addressing their concerns.During the event, Facebook staff shared links to a video of an exchange between Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zuckerberg last October when he said: ""If anyone, including a politician, is saying things that can cause, that is calling for violence or could risk imminent physical harm ... we will take that content down.""At one point, roughly 22,000 people had tuned into the live video feed, according to another Facebook worker who was watching the stream. The figure reflects nearly half of the company's 48,000 employees.The top question for Zuckerberg, which called for changes to the company's stance on political speech, received more than 5,400 votes from workers, the employee said.Not all employees disagree with Zuckerberg's position, however. One told CNN Business, ""Supporting free speech - especially when you vehemently disagree with what the person is saying - is a hard but important stance needed to make sure everyone can have a voice.""The employee said it is hard to be sure what portion of Facebook's staff supports Zuckerberg's decision. At least a few people with whom they have spoken do support it but are nervous to say so more publicly because they have seen the pushback within the company, the employee said.Tuesday's event follows days of employee activism over Facebook's handling of Trump's content.Some staffers staged a virtual walkout on Monday to protest decisions made by the company's leaders concerning posts by Trump. And at least one worker, software engineer Timothy Aveni, has quit his job, saying it is no longer feasible to ""keep excusing Facebook's behavior.""Facebook's workforce is known for keeping its disputes with executives largely private. But that changed on Friday, when Zuckerberg announced he would not act against content by Trump that Twitter had flagged earlier as having violated its own rules. The decision has prompted widespread criticism within Facebook that has spilled into public, with numerous employees expressing their disagreement on Twitter.One of Trump's posts had claimed, in reference to the demonstrations in Minneapolis, that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — a phrase with racist origins. Trump later professed not to know the history of the phrase, but he allowed the original remark to stand on Facebook and Twitter.Zuckerberg said the content provoked in him a ""visceral negative reaction."" But he justified his decision not to act against the posts, citing his responsibility as the ""leader of an institution committed to free expression.""In the eyes of his harshest internal critics, Zuckerberg had simply caved on prior principled commitments.""Mark can patch this one section of Facebook's policies, but if he derives his principle from the particular actions he wants to take, instead of taking action based on principle, it'll be fruitless in the long run,"" Aveni said in response to a CNN reporter's question on his post.",0.0

On Tuesday, he spoke and answered questions from the crowd. Louisville Courier Journal LOUISVILLE, Ky. — After criticism from peaceful protesters who took to downtown streets to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, only to be dispersed and tear-gassed ahead of curfew, Louisville Metro Police explained its reasoning Tuesday for breaking up gatherings. Maj. David Allen, who oversees LMPD's administrative division, said Tuesday that police have seen items that concern officers — including bricks, fireworks, leaf blowers, Molotov cocktails, shields and mason jars protesters have brought to demonstrations. Allen said mason jars have been thrown ""with gasoline in them, urine, a mixture with vomit in it."" ""We've also had individuals throwing frozen water bottles,"" he said. ""We've had gallon jugs of different liquids thrown at us as well."" Copies of the images and video footage were not immediately provided to The Courier Journal and police did not immediately respond to a Courier Journal question about whether anyone had been charged in connection with the incidents. More: Mayor Fischer says Louisville welcomes peaceful protest. Why was one cleared with tear gas? None of the items alone would lead police to disperse the crowd or use tear gas, Allen said, but leadership monitors ""the entire landscape and the behavior in the crowd and watch for signs that violence or disturbance will erupt soon."" ""For example, we've seen the crowd start warning participants with kids to head out,"" he said. Allen added that each night, officers have given ""multiple verbal warnings to disperse over the loudspeakers"" and ""clearly shown our intent"" by slowly and intentionally putting on gas masks. ""Thankfully, many protesters have simply walked away. And that's exactly what we've asked,"" Allen said. Demonstrations, often with hundreds of people, have swept downtown streets in recent days and, since Monday, have spread to include the intersection of 26th and Broadway, near where David McAtee was fatally shot in early morning hours. Protesters have called for justice for Taylor, demanding the officers involved in her fatal police shooting be fired. They've also voiced concerns about law enforcement's disparate treatment of black Americans. Some told The Courier Journal they were terrified of becoming ""another statistic"" or ""another funeral."" The fatal shooting of McAtee, who was described as a ""community pillar"" by his mother, has only added to the pain protesters say they are feeling. I cannot believe what I just witnessed. They pulled up onto the square with a police siren on and did this. #Louisvillepic.twitter.com/65o2lgZCJh — Natalie Neysa Alund (@nataliealund) May 30, 2020 On Saturday, police destroyed milk jugs and cases of water that protesters had stockpiled in Jefferson Square Park in anticipation of tear gas. Mayor Greg Fischer said in a press briefing that night that mason jars with flammable materials were among the supplies that had been assembled, along with other materials he could not identify that he claimed could have harmed protesters and police. From Sunday: Breonna Taylor protesters question police tactics used prior to Louisville's curfew time City officials have also said protests have been broken up because of the presence of leaf blowers. Assistant Chief of Police LaVita Chavous has said they can be used to ""block back chemicals into police's faces or blow back the gas, chemicals that we may use in an effort so that they can continue to be out there protesting and causing problems."" ""We assume that they weren't going to blow leaves, and so we assume that those leaf blowers were for something to hurt us,"" she said Sunday. On Tuesday, Allen added that leaf blowers can direct tear gas back toward officers. He said they can also blow ""different chemical agents"" or ""powdered bleach"" at officers — dangerous not only for officers but also anyone nearby. This story may be updated.

Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenTwitter CEO responds to Trump: 'Not true' that removing campaign video was illegal Biden formally clinches Democratic presidential nomination Warren, Pressley introduce bill to make it a crime for police officers to deny medical care to people in custody MORE (D-Mass.) has called on the Pentagon’s internal watchdog to investigate any role the military has played in supporting law enforcement efforts responding to protests in Washington, D.C., and across the country. In a letter to Sean O’Donnell, the Defense Department’s acting inspector general, Warren specifically cited efforts to disperse protesters on Monday outside the White House that preceded a photo op by President Trump Donald John TrumpProsecutors allege Avenatti may have violated terms of prison release Bolton plans to publish White House memoir in late June: report The sad spectacle of Trump's enablers MORE in front of a church that was targeted by arsonists the night before. Warren said she was requesting “an investigation of the involvement of civilian and military Department of Defense (DoD) personnel in suppressing peaceful domestic protests.” ADVERTISEMENT “This ‘ambush’ of American citizens who were protesting the killing of [George] Floyd was created to allow the President to partake in a blatantly political photo opportunity that included DoD Secretary Mark T. Esper and General Mark A. Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,” Warren, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, wrote.

Military helicopters have also been spotted flying low above protesters in D.C. in an attempt to disperse demonstrators. ADVERTISEMENT The protest Monday near the White House was just one of several demonstrations to take place condemning the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis last week. “These attacks on peaceful American protesters steps away from the White House were sickening and appalling. And the potential role of DoD civilian and military leadership in ordering these attacks and then participating in [a] political propaganda event with the President raises profound and troubling questions,” Warren said. The Massachusetts lawmaker asked that O’Donnell probe to what extent any Pentagon personnel were involved in suppressing the protest in D.C. and other areas, what training the personnel have to respond to protests and the specific roles Esper and Milley played in the response outside the White House. Esper told NBC News in an interview that he was given no advance notice when Trump led him and other administration officials to St. John’s. Trump has offered bellicose rhetoric toward the demonstrations, many of which have started peacefully during the day and devolved into violence at night. Trump has repeatedly declared himself the president of “law and order” and lambasted Democratic governors and local officials for what he says has been an insufficient response. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” Trump tweeted Tuesday, referring to riots in New York City. NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast! Don’t make the same horrible and deadly mistake you made with the Nursing Homes!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2020 Trump’s recent remarks and the events outside the White House on Monday sparked an avalanche of criticism from Democrats who said he was overstepping his bounds. “The President of the United States tear-gassed peaceful protestors in order to clear the way for a useless photo-op outside the White House—just after vowing to activate the military against our own people.

No matter where Dave Doran worked, people loved him. Retired ST Louis City Police Officer David Ellison says Dorn helped him out of poverty and into a life as a police officer. Dave Doran was a great man. He was fair there, sharpest, cleanest. We came out of the car. His presence was well known and observed, and he meant business when it was time to take care of business. The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in ST Louis, says Dorn was the type of brother that would have given his life to save them if he had.

It came on a violent night in St. Louis, where four officers were shot, officers were pelted with rocks and fireworks and 55 businesses were burglarized or damaged, including a convenience store that burned. Police also shot and gravely injured a burglary suspect who they say shot at officers.Cities across the U.S. have seen protests and violence since George Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleaded for air.Dorn, who was black, was a friend of the pawn shop’s owner and frequently checked on the business when alarms went off, his wife, St. Louis police Sgt.

He then became chief of Moline Acres, a small town in St. Louis County.Former St. Louis County police Chief Tim Fitch knew Dorn for 30 years and said they became close friends when Dorn and his wife were leading the St. Louis police department's Explorers program for young people interested in law enforcement careers, while Fitch was leading the county's program.“He was very dedicated to youth, especially disadvantaged youth,"" said Fitch, who led the St. Louis County Police Department from 2009 to 2014. “He wanted to see them succeed. He wanted to be a role model for those young men and women to go into law enforcement.”Dorn' s personality was “bigger than life,” Fitch said. ""He was a fun guy, a happy guy. You never had to wonder what he was thinking when somebody did something incredibly stupid like a crime because he would just say it as he saw it.”When he took over as chief in Moline Acres, Dorn made it clear that his officers would be held to the strictest of standards, Fitch said.“He wanted them to do the right thing all the time,"" Fitch said.The Ethical Society of Police, which represents black officers in St. Louis, said in a news release that Dorn was “the type of brother that would’ve given his life to save them if he had to.”St. Louis police Chief John Hayden called Dorn a ""fine captain.”“Many of us, the other officers, looked up to him,” Hayden said.

The two men are certain to face each other on the presidential ballot in November, yet party rules require them first to accumulate a majority of delegates in the months long state-by-state primary season.Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination in March.Pennsylvania, which offered Tuesday's largest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground.Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations.“Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said.Biden was in Philadelphia earlier Tuesday to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation after the police killing of George Floyd. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.”Related video: Joe Biden addresses civil unrest over police brutality of black men and womenVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party.The comments served as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment.Party unity was an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominated the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day.At the same time, several major cities, particularly Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia among those voting Tuesday, struggled to contain protests and related looting that led to thousands of arrests.Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday.“Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.”Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail, despite Trump's repeated warning against it. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states on Tuesday expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that led to long lines.Those voting Tuesday included the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections on Tuesday, Idaho and Iowa, chose their presidential nominee early in the year.“We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others would be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.”",0.0

Since June of 2019, I have visited twelve countries, three continents, and lived in two separate countries other than my own. Almost every country that I have visited, I was faced with people who look down on Americans. They point the finger and say gross generalizations about my countrymen. I have defended my country countless times in the past year because I know of America’s true values and people. I have always been able to tell myself ‘at least we aren’t as bad as this country’. There has always been a worse people, worse governments, and more unjust treatment. But with the current news of police brutality, protests, and killings, I am at a loss of words. Instead of the willingness and need to defend my country I, too, feel angry. I have a pit in my stomach that will not go away. Change isn’t happening soon enough. Innocent people are dying, the people are being ignored, and I no longer can justify action happening in my country. It is not a political issue to believe in the Bill of Rights. As Americans, we have certain unalienable rights that should never be questioned. We have the right to protest. We have a right to free speech. We have a protection against unreasonable search and seizure. I am so thankful to have been born in a country that believes in such strong human rights, but I feel these are being pulled away from people in our country. We deserve to feel safe in our own homes. We deserve to be able to stand up for what we believe is right. This is why the people of Kentucky should be upset about the mistreatment of people at the hands of the police. We must remember what it means to be an American and what makes us different from other countries. Why do we have to wait until it’s our brother or sister or friends? The unjust actions are not just happening in big cities and states across the country from us, they are right here in Louisville, Kentucky. Breonna Taylor was 26-years-old and a graduate of the University of Kentucky. She was a dedicated EMT and served to protect the people of Kentucky. She was stripped of her right to a safe home and the protection against unreasonable search and seizure. Breonna was killed in her bed by police officers who invaded her home via a no-knock warrant in search of a man who was already in their custody. I believe it is a time for change and a time to join together for those who have died by people who should be protecting them. I have always felt safe when around police officers, and I do believe most officers are there to serve and protect our citizens. But why do we defend those officers that break this oath? Why do we accept death after death and justify the reasoning? We as a country are better than that. We have a right to feel safe and create a country in which future generations feel safe. There is no longer justification for the wrongful deaths of American citizens. I am not an expert or even a writer, I am just a 21-year-old college senior who feels like enough is enough. I miss the feeling of being a proud American. I hope that these unjust killings incite enough anger in us to get involved, let’s support peaceful protests, donate to charities that help the families of victims like Breonna Taylor, and most importantly hold our government and police force accountable. Kentuckians should want to be on the right side of history and now is the time to stand together. I hope for the day when we no longer have to justify.

But he believes the violence could have been avoided entirely if the National Guard hadn’t been there in the first place. “You send down the National Guard down here, which are trained killers,” said Martin, a lifelong Louisville resident who frequented McAtee’s restaurant. “And when they heard gunshots — if there were gunshots, nobody’s been able to substantiate that — they fired in that direction.” Gov. Andy Beshear activated the National Guard on Saturday, after seven people were wounded by gunfire the first night of protests and significant property damage was done to downtown Louisville on Friday. More than 17,000 National Guard troops have been activated in 23 states as similar protests have spread. By Tuesday afternoon, on the sixth day of protests, Gov. Andy Beshear announced the National Guard will reduce its presence in Louisville, based on the recommendation of Brigadier General Hal Lamberton, Adjutant General of the Kentucky National Guard. He declined to say how many guard members would still be in town because of strategic reasons. Reporters in the West End, downtown and the Highlands on Tuesday evening saw almost no National Guard members in the field as of 10 p.m. “I believe that the Guard has been necessary… I called them in solely to try to ensure that people are safe,” Beshear said. But civil liberties advocates and Louisvillians said the National Guard’s presence likely escalated tensions and, ultimately, violence. Martin figures most of the National Guard members stationed in Louisville this weekend had never even been to the West End before, and they don’t understand it. Walt and Shae Smith He said he knew McAtee to be a peaceful man, and he knows some Louisville police officers personally. In fact, he called to check up on one on Monday after the death of McAtee. “The ones that I know personally, they are crying and feeling the grief and pain just like we are,” Martin said. “Those National Guardsmen that were down here, they are not in this community. They don’t know nothing. “If they were a true person in this community, they’d know this guy sits on this corner, they know the audience sits on this corner, and nobody bothers nobody.” Aaron Tucek, a legal fellow at the ACLU of Kentucky, was the co-author of a report by the International Network of Civil Liberties Organizations entitled Defending Dissent: Toward State Practices That Protect and Promote the Rights to Protest. The report examined how governments can protect the right to protest and free speech. Tucek said that, in the course of that research, they heard a consistent refrain: “uniformed soldiers are almost never beneficial to protest responses.” “The National Guard was sent in with a mission to maintain peace,” Tucek said. “And as several days passed since they’ve come here, that does not seem to be what has happened. After they’ve arrived there’s been more violence, and in fact were present when a man was killed.” Tucek said the situations from this past weekend that have gone well were situations where authorities showed restraint. “If you look at what the National Guard does, they are an auxiliary to the United States Armed Forces,” he said. “They travel around the world and they’ve seen combat, and that is primarily the role that is imagined for them.” But in protest situations, he said, it’s restraint that’s really helpful. One of the units in town is from the 138th Field Artillery of Lexington, which is currently assigned to the National Guard Reaction Force, known as the NGRF. Every National Guard force assigns a unit to NGRF duty for year-long missions. They’re trained to handle “rapid response capability focused on incidents requiring law enforcement or security support,” according to a fact sheet provided by the Kentucky National Guard. The NGRF receives specialized training in civil disturbance control, securing locations and personnel and setting up roadblocks or checkpoints. Tucek said that training could be unproductive when dealing with protests like the ones in Louisville. “If all that training is looking at how to use violence in response to crowds, that is not going into the kind of de-escalation training or non-escalation training or dialogue and engagement that can actually allow protests to go very smoothly,” Tucek said. “I’ve seen no indication that these Kentucky National Guard troops or really National Guard troops across the country have had that sort of specialized training.” The 138th Field Artillery unit’s NGRF assignment was set to end on Monday, but Maj. Stephen Martin, the director of the Kentucky National Guard’s Public Affairs Office, said they will see the current mission in Louisville through. Submitted On Monday evening, President Donald Trump called for military action to quell the protests. Shortly after those comments and in the wake of the shooting, Louisvillians saw an unfamiliar sight: Black Hawk helicopters flew into Louisville and landed at Bowman Field. In Washington, D.C. that same evening, the helicopters flew low over protesters, prompting the District of Columbia National Guard to investigate. But city and state officials said the helicopters were not connected to the Guard’s enforcement, though they do have UH-60 Blackhawks. Maj. Martin said the helicopters were not the Guard’s; Jessica Wethington, a spokesperson for the mayor’s office, said they were from the Fort Knox Aviation Group and were performing “a routine training landing mission.” She referred further questions to Fort Knox, and a public affairs officer didn’t respond to a request for comment. Maj. Martin said the NGRF is equipped with crowd control equipment similar to pepper balls and teargas used by the Louisville Metro Police Department. Such equipment includes shields, batons, crowd dispersal pellets and cartridges, flashbangs and stingballs. When the National Guard accompanied LMPD to the corner of 26th and Broadway, however, the confrontation ended in a hail of real bullets that left David McAtee dead. LMPD and city officials released silent surveillance footage on Tuesday that they say appears to show McAtee fires first, and the National Guard and police officers returned fire. But officials have acknowledged the video is far from conclusive. The officers who fired their weapons didn’t activate their body cameras, in violation of LMPD policy. Kentucky executive cabinet Secretary J. Michael Brown said on Tuesday that a total of 18 rounds were fired between the National Guard, carrying CAR-15 rifles, and the Louisville police, but it appears McAtee was killed by a single bullet to the chest. Tucek of the ACLU said there are still a lot of unanswered questions regarding why National Guard soldiers were in the West End when protests were in another part of the city. City officials said they were enforcing the curfew by breaking up the large gathering at the intersection. U.S. Senate Candidate and State Rep. Charles Booker also questioned why the National Guard was on the scene in the first place. “The decision to send an armed military force into the West End of Louisville is a clear escalation of an already tense situation,” Booker said in a statement. “I have not heard a reasonable explanation for why the National Guard was deployed to 26th and Broadway, or how their presence was intended to make our city any safer.” Beshear said at Tuesday’s press conference that, after McAtee was killed, the National Guard had been instructed to stay out of the West End. But when a fire broke out on the roof of Dino’s Food Mart, across the street from Yaya’s BBQ shop where he was killed, a group of National Guard members assigned to assist the fire department arrived on the scene. The National Guard left before the fire trucks and other law enforcement, but Beshear said the guard should not have been there. “We made sure we rectified that,” Beshear said.

The crosstown trip was excoriated by several Catholic leaders, including Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory of Washington, who said he found it “baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles” by allowing the visit. The Trumps’ visit to the shrine in Northeast Washington came on the 41st anniversary of the start of St. John Paul II’s pilgrimage to his native Poland, the first trip by the pope during which he repeatedly addressed religious and political freedom. The White House said the president offered no remarks during the visit. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accompanied the Trumps during the brief stay at the shrine. Over 100 people, including children and their parents, had gathered near the shrine and began chanting slogans calling for justice for George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis May 25. Archbishop Gregory said Catholic teaching calls the faithful to “defend the rights of all people, even those with whom we might disagree.” The evening before the shrine visit, Trump walked from the White House to St. John Episcopal Church, which was set afire during protests May 31 that called for the nation to address racism and police violence. Authorities fired flash-bang shells, gas and rubber bullets to disperse a crowd that had gathered in Lafayette Square across from the White House so Trump could walk to the church, where he held up a Bible as photographers captured the scene. The crowd was present in the park to protest the death of Floyd and other African American people at the hands of police. Archbishop Gregory in his June 2 statement questioned the decision to disperse the protesters in such a manner. “St. John Paul II was an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings. His legacy bears vivid witness to that truth. He certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.” The shrine issued a statement about the visit less than two hours after the president and first lady left. It said White House officials originally scheduled the visit “as an event for the president to sign an executive order related to global religious freedom.” “This was fitting given St. John Paul II was a tireless advocate of religious liberty throughout his pontificate,” the statement said. “International religious freedom receives widespread bipartisan support, including unanimous passage of legislation in defense of persecuted Christians and religious minorities around the world. “The shrine welcomes all people to come and pray and learn about the legacy of St. John Paul II,” it added. At least one other bishop was critical of the shrine visit. Bishop John E. Stowe of Lexington, Kentucky, tweeted early June 2 that he hoped during the visit “someone proclaims today’s Gospel (Mark 12:13-17) where Herodians and Pharisees are called out for their hypocrisy.” A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said the bishops would not comment on the event because it “was not ours.” Returning to the White House, Trump signed an executive order during the noon hour that the White House described as prioritizing U.S. support for religious freedom worldwide. The order calls for the U.S. to allocate at least $50 million annually for international religious freedom programs. It also would widen economic incentives to support countries that expand religious practice and address attempts to restrict religious practice. In addition, the order would align foreign assistance “to better reflect country circumstances,” restrict issuing visas and implement sanctions under the 2012 Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, which targets human rights abuses and global corruption. The law is named for Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer, who died in 2009 after being arrested and tortured in custody by officers of the Russian Ministry of the Interior. A final provision of the order would mandate more federal employees who work abroad to undergo international religious freedom training. Several observers questioned the president’s commitment to constitutionally protected freedoms given his efforts to limit the rights of refugees seeking asylum and past policies seeking to separate immigrant children from their parents. Trump said June 1 he supports the rights of nonviolent protesters seeking justice for Floyd but that it is necessary to quell rioters who have looted businesses and set buildings and vehicles afire during clashes with authorities that have resulted in millions of dollars in damage and left dozens of people injured. Patricia McGuire, president of Trinity Washington University, a short distance from the shrine, charged that Trump was misappropriating religious symbols for political gain rather than broadly supporting religious freedom. “He’s torn down the wall between church and state … and instead (is) weaponizing religion for his own political goals,” she told Catholic News Service. McGuire called on the U.S. Catholic bishops to stand “shoulder to shoulder at this shrine and tell him in no uncertain terms that this promotion of religion for political purposes is wrong.” Sister Simone Campbell, a Sister of Social Service, who is executive director of the Catholic social justice lobbying group Network, accused the president of having “no clue about the teaching of Pope John Paul II or of our Catholic faith.” “He refusal to acknowledge the racism and police violence that started this and has been rife in our nation, that he exacerbates show he has no evidence of insight or remorse,” Sister Campbell said. “This is crass politics at its worst,” she added. “It’s ignoring the reality of our nation. This is not about religious liberty. This is about human life, human dignity and police violence.” The Trumps’ stay at the shrine lasted about 20 minutes. At one point the couple exited the shrine and posed for pictures next to a statue of St. John Paul II bedecked with a wreath of red and white flowers and a red, white and blue ribbon. They turned to stand in front of the statue for a minute and faced photographers again before returning indoors.",0.0

FRANKFORT, Ky. — Kentucky's top law enforcement officer promises the truth will be revealed in the Breonna Taylor case. Attorney General, Daniel Cameron, finds himself in a unique position as the first African-American Attorney General in Kentucky history and a key role in the controversial case of the Louisville EMT shot to death by police in her own home.  In an exclusive interview with WHAS 11, General Cameron called for law and order as peaceful protests march through the streets of Louisville. He also encouraged demonstration leaders to continue to separate their activities from bad actors who are looking to silence any meaningful dialogue.  “I’ve already encouraged people to reach out to me to have larger constructive conversations about how we can all move forward together in a unified way and I think that is part of my responsibility as a black man who sits in the Attorney General's Office”, Mr. Cameron said. When asked whether he should march with the protesters, he answered, “I think, in terms of there is a current investigation ongoing as it relates to Miss Breonna Taylor, I don't' want to do anything to compromise that investigation. So how I can be best utilized, at this point, is to give serious consideration and attention to the investigation.”  Cameron is charged with finding the truth, and delivering justice, in an unprecedented time.  “We need leadership from all facets of American life”, he insisted, “and that's why I think it is so important that we all walk together as we move forward.” He talked about the healing process and referenced video I tweeted from Monday’s protest in which LMPD officers were seen marching arm-in-arm with demonstrators. But General Cameron acknowledges that without truth, healing is nearly impossible. He would not comment on specifics of the Talyor case but did say that his office is starting to see details of the LMPD Public Integrity Unit investigation. They’ll begin fully investigating when the PIU investigation finishes which he expects to be soon. Any decision about the officer's employment is in the hands of Mayor Fischer and the interim chief.  “What I have said is that we have a responsibility to make sure that the truth is known and that is my job and responsibility. I take it very seriously"", he told us. When asked wither the truth will be known, Cameron responded, “We will do that. Yes sir!” ►Make it easy to keep up-to-date with more stories like this.

Because if we don't, then law enforcement will be unable to do what they sworn oath to do, which is to protect and serve the public, all the public, not just certain parts of it. We want to be the American city that breaks that cycle, becoming a model for the nation off police community relations. And we need your help to do that. Specifically tonight, we'd like to address questions regarding the decision process in using to get tear gas and other crowd dispersion techniques. So I've asked Major Dave Allen to discuss that in more detail. Also, Major Bobby Cooper. We'll talk about global fires, investigation into the fire It he knows, which was discussed in yesterday's briefing. But before they do that, I wanted to give you an update on the level Metro Department of Corrections. As of 70 clock this morning, we had booked 125 individuals for protest related activity, and we had released 116 of those individuals. There have been no issues inside the jail with the protesters. We have kept them separate from the rest of the population and the vast majority have been released within 24 hours yesterday. Authority have been released within 24 hours yesterday. We know that the courts closed early on Sunday night and through tomorrow are through yesterday due to protest activity and that caused a bit of a backlog. A small handful of the protesters were arrested solely for curfew violation, but again the vast majority were arrested for other things, including criminal mischief, alcohol intoxication and unlawful assembly. Since the disturbance early Sunday morning that was briefed in a press conference with the mayor, we've had no other incidents or disturbances and again that particular activity did not involve any of the individuals who had been arrested in relation to the protests. Since that time, the disturbance on the sixth floor has been cleaned up, the windows have been replaced and we've started to move people back into that part of the jail. Today. We did use in that and calling that disturbance we did use pepper gas to control the situation. Inmates used water and as a result, some property was contaminated, including some items of clothing and personal photographs and other personal effects. For that, we apologize. And we know that that has obviously created some concern on the part of some family members that I'd like to turn it over to Major Bobby Cooper to give us an update on the D Knows Fire. Thank you, Chief. Has is was well documented last night from several news outlets that were on the scene and Deena's before we arrived. Uh, fire did. Was was on the roof of Gino's little fire Department. Crews were dispatched at 10 46. We arrived on scene within two minutes at 2 40 Defined as was was clear of fire on the roof. Crews were quick to letter the roof the hose to the fire and extinguish the fire toe. Have the main body of fire knocked down under control within five minutes. Um, we've been requested our arson investigators to report this scene. Arson is arson. Investigators began their investigation yesterday evening on, and they concluded that today I'm not for that investigation. Today they were able to determine that the calls was from an incendiary device, a Molotov cocktail, which is a again a crude, combustible, incendiary device that was likely thrown onto the roof on ignited a portion. The roof. There was minor damage to the roof. A swell is throughout the structure. Some minor smoke damage and water damage. That was sustained. Um, and the good news is that no firefighters were injured on the scene. No civilians were injured either. So we are changing that calls from under investigation, too incendiary. Thank you. Thank you, Major. Next, I'd like to ask Major Dave Allen to come up and talk about the use of force and particularly the thresholds for deploying dispersion techniques. Thank you, Chief s. Over the past several days, we've heard many questions from the community about what prompts us to use tear gas and other less lethal crowd dispersal tactics. So I'm gonna take a few minutes and go over a few of the things we have actually seen in the event venue and help explain some of the reasoning behind what we do. We're gonna look at some images now. Um, first you see a truck with bricks and blocks in it of our officers have already experienced a truck driving around throwing blocks at us or at our officers We've also found already two piles of bricks that were brought into into the event venue and left. Ah, just sitting there way, See a, uh, explosive firework. We believe we've had several M 80 explosive fireworks thrown at officers. We've even had an officer injured when one of them struck his head. We've had a lot of questions about the leaf blowers that were observed thes particular leaf blowers were here and Louisville. We've also seen pictures of other individuals individuals with leaf blowers across the country. Leaf blowers can easily be used to direct the tear gas back towards our officers. But they also can be used to put different chemical agents in them or, ah, powdered bleach in them to blow toward the officers. This is not only dangerous for officers, but this is also dangerous for anyone that is near these individuals with the blowers. Here we see a Molotov cocktail getting ready to be lit. These Molotov cocktails were using flammable substances that then become on aerial assault on our officers. It's so far we've had an officer's uniform catch fire because of these things. They are also very dangerous for the crowd. Very dangerous. for the person trying to throw them on the next, we'll see some various pictures of weapon weapons that we've seen in the event venue and obviously, ah that there's concern. Anytime we see weapons, um, out just out in the public like this, we also see have seen quite a few shields, whether it's plywood, trash can lids are various items used to block and deflect The less lethal options that we have used in this allows the protesters to get closer to our officers so that they can then throw items that are officers. And then we have a video to show some of what's what's been thrown at us. Here. You'll see ah Mason jars being thrown. We've had mason jars already with gasoline in them. You're in a mixture with vomit in it. We've also had individuals throwing frozen water bottles, taking water bottles out of much of what was used for hydration and in grabbing those water bottles, just normal water bottles and throwing a Mattis. We've had gallon jugs of different liquids thrown at us as well, so I want to be clear that the simple presence of any of these items alone is not going to prompt us to disperse or used tear gas. But we monitor the entire landscape and the behavior in the crowd and watch for signs that violence or the servant disturbance will erupt. Soon. For example, we've seen the crowds start warning participants with kids to head out E. Tonight we've been We have given multiple verbal warnings to disperse over the loudspeakers, and we've also clearly shown are intent by allowing the demonstrators to observe our officers slowly and intentionally putting on their gas masks as this has occurred. Thankfully, many protesters have simply walked away, and that's exactly what we have asked. So hopefully this helps give some idea of what we're dealing with and what will prompt us to shut down a protest, possibly even prior to the time of the curfew. Thank you, Major. And at this point, I'd like to welcome any questions that you might have. All right. First question is, we have relate to thes shooting of David McAtee and I've every resulting investigation, so I'll ask assistant, she shave us to respond. Thank you, Chief Hiss. The first question is, can you confirm or was there report made that the girl was shot. There was no report made that anyone was shot in that particular incident. And then also, it says. On Sunday morning, we learned five officers were referred at on Saturday night near ninth and Broadway. How did those officers been react to being shot at? Did they fire back? I do not have any information on the officers being shot on Saturday night or shut it on Saturday night. However, I can only imagine that if they were shot it and of course, they were concerned about that, and they probably took measures to protect themselves. There's another question. Do arrest reflect prior claims that a large percentage of protesters air from out of town? If not, why not? There are many arrests that we have. A lot of them are local people. Some are out of town. Are there any suspects in the shootings on Thursday night? Saturday night in the shots for last night? No, At this time, we do not have any suspects, I believe on Ah, the shootings on Thursday night. Is it police policy to shoot into a crowd like we saw in the videos from 26 Broadway? They appeared to fire several shots, and it seems like many people could have been hit. It is police policy when we use a When we used pepper balls spray to actually shoot at the ground in front of the crowd in an effort to get them to disperse, please read my context with time codes above for public to here, along with the question. Okay, so we will. I have to throw back up real quick. There's a question from Spectrum News one. I have seen a peach video from the second business camera and laid them down side by side in editing software with slow motion to view and in the context before the questions is with video. Sync up at 5 13 there's a water butter on the table outside, on the right that explodes. Then it five. It actually says 51 45 but I believe it means 5 14 The door glass shatters on ya ya door. Then, at 5 15 you see smoke come from ya yas door after the glass on the door shatters at the same time from video. Inside, you see a girl in white pants and dark shirt jump back, starting at 2 18 in at 2 19 put her right arm up to the front of her left shoulder blade as if she's been shot. After that, you see, David McIntosh will put his right arm up in this outside the door. So then you ask the question. Can you confirm? Or was there a report made that the girl was shot? There was no report that anyone was shot. As's faras. That girl is concerned, and if so, what was she shot with? That goes back to question one. There's no reporter that as long as question two is, what is her condition? Uh, if there was no one shot, then of course, there's no answer to that in Let's grow down, I think. Is it okay? We gotta score down to the next question. Okay, I believe there. If I go back to, um suspects in the shootings on Thursday night, Saturday night and shots right last night, there's one suspect in that, so I'll get the information to that, provided that later on. The next question after that is, can you confirm that equity had a firearm and what is the object on the kitchen floor after the shooting took place, there was a female inside that was pointing towards a gun. So the object on the floor after the shooting took place was a firearm. I can confirmed that Mecca T had a weapon in his hand that he had a gun in his hand. And if you look at the video, the gun was found close to the body is a curfew. A law are suggested. It is the law. The next question is, has to Pia, you investigation into the fatal police shooting of Bianna Taylor being completed. If not, when is it expected to be completed? The majority of the Pou investigation into the shooting of Briana Taylor has been completed and forwarded to the Attorney General's Office. There are other evidence of our items of evidence that will come in. If there's anything additional are followed that may be done. It will be forwarded to the Attorney General's office as well. They have an opportunity to review our at least start the initial review of the majority of the case. A. There's a question of with regard to the foot it you've shown of weapons protesters arm water bottles. Why not arrest those individuals and confiscate the weapons rather than dispersing the entire peaceful protests. And I'm gonna Allen to come back up and answer that question. Thank you, Colonel, In response to the question about arresting the protesters throwing water bottles of that would be ideal if we could do that and allow the, uh, peaceful protest to go on that I believe that would be ideal. But that is simply not possible. Giving what we're observing on the ground. It's not just water bottles being thrown at us. There are many other objects, and we're not just going to send officers up to get somebody who's throwing water bottles once that has begun. We have already seen other tactics being used against us and items being prepared to be used against us to try to bait us to come get those individuals who are just simply throwing water bottles. There's much bigger picture that we're looking at there. Okay, there's another question. Why were, uh, Mr Mecca t the people hanging out on his porch? Why were they confronted by the police in the first place? And I'll answer that. The first question it appears that people were hanging out because Mr Mecca T was running a business where he could barbecue. Ah, I don't know their personal reasons for hanging out, but from the video they were all hanging in in his porch on his front porch. It says the video ill seems to show people hanging out and getting pelted with pepper balls and then going inside of MCA teas. The the police did not actually confront the people directly. They were clearing the lighting as they were going towards that location. They had an issue, it appears with another individual. And then at that time Ah, I believe that's when a shot was fired and then they returned with the Pepper boss Berry. And there's another question. If David McAtee was find a weapon, do you have any thoughts about why people look to be running towards him rather than away? I have no idea why people would look to be running towards him, uh, another. The next question is, how did Mr Mecca Ty's body get to the street? And did he leave his business after being injured by gunfire? Or did Emma's move him? That is part of the investigation that we will be looking into what is the department's policy on the use of lethal force, specifically fern into a crowd like we saw in the videos from 26 Broadway. The department's policy on the use of lethal force is that the officers are able to use lethal force if they feel threatened to their lives or to other people's laughs in from spectrum news. In earlier press conference, it stated that Makati appears to have fired the first shots with my video lay down side by side at 4 57 it shows smoke appears on sidewalk outside. Directly under the two inch in 2020 are the letter to the number two in 2020 for videos Time code. At this point, we know that Makati is inside the kitchen and not near the door at that point. That is when you start to see all of the people. Knew ya. Yas, come inside. Yeah, Yes. Kitchen. Do you know who shot this shot on the sidewalk? That is a part of the investigation. I'm just going to say that we still have a lot of questions in this video. May raise more questions than it answers on, and we have those same questions that some of you all have. And that is where we're conducting an investigation. This video does show that he fired his weapon at the door of his business as police approached. And it also confirms he was shot back either A National Guard member. Arenella, MPD officer. Thank you. Thank you, Assistant Chief, shave us. Uh, now, obviously, I know that you have a lot of questions that we did not answer or cannot answer because of pending investigation and a lot of things we didn't get to today all we were hoping to do really was to help inform a lot of the questions and concerns that we've heard over the past several days and to provide additional information so that we have a better understanding. We understand, however, that that it is not going to satisfy a lot of the questions and concerns that are out there. And that's why we need We want toe work with you to understand what those concerns and questions are and to build that relationship to close that gap. Thank you.

And the mayhem has led many merchants to clear their stock, board their windows and barricade their doors against more trouble. Neither business leaders nor city officials have yet to tabulate estimates of damage after nights of protests related to the death of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor, an unarmed black woman who was shot during a March 13 police raid at her apartment. Business leaders, certainly upset about the millions of dollars in losses, say the violent protests signal a need for a more inclusive and diverse economy throughout Louisville. After looters and vandals hit dozens of downtown businesses late last Friday night and early Saturday morning, another wave hit Monday night into early Tuesday on West Broadway, New Cut Road and Outer Loop after law enforcement officers fatally shot David McAtee, a well-known barbecue stand owner who they say fired first. Vandals smashed plate-glass windows, hammered glass display cabinets inside stores and made off with everything from fine wines at the upscale Eddie Merlot's to potato chips from a corner supermarket at Third and Broadway. They spray-painted ""BLM"" — Black Lives Matter — and anti-police messages on downtown buildings. A coin shop, restaurants, a Subway, a watch repair, CVS pharmacy, Heine Brothers' Coffee, Stewart's Pawn Shop and several hotels were hit. That included the 600-room Omni Louisville Hotel, where several street-level windows were broken, especially around Falls City Market on Liberty Street. Live updates: LMPD says additional video footage shows David McAtee firing gun Inside the hotel complex, looters busted into a liquor store, smashed bottles of bourbon, vodka and wine and carted some off, spokeswoman Kerri Richardson said. Because of the damage, the hotel likely will need to delay its expected July reopening ""even longer"" after closing during the coronavirus pandemic, she said. The epicenter of the destruction through Monday involved the blocks bounded by Market Street and Broadway between Sixth and Second streets. But other areas, such as a Norton Healthcare facility and a tire store along East Broadway, as well as a Dixie Highway sporting goods store, also sustained smashed windows, broken equipment and thefts. Late Monday night and early Tuesday destruction spread to southern Louisville, where looters hit a Walgreens at New Cut Road and Palatka Road, as well as the Walmart Supercenter, Verizon and GameStop on Outer Loop. In a statement, Walmart officials said ""we’re monitoring this situation closely as it develops and will continue closing stores in select markets as a safety precaution for our customers and associates. Several locations have been impacted, and we will work to assess the damage and plan to reopen as soon as possible."" The Kroger at 28th Street and Broadway was closed after looters busted into a side door overnight Monday. Thieves also broke into nearby Chase bank ATM where video from mayhem showed several making off with handfuls of cash. The destruction has left business owners wondering what's next. ""Nobody wants to be in a city with graffiti and boarded-up windows. That's what we've got now,"" said Amar Kahedy, who owns the Weissinger-Gaulbert and the Fincastle, apartment and office buildings with ground level retail shops near Third and Broadway. He also owns The Gramercy, a wedding and events venue nearby. Several property owners and proprietors expressed frustration with Louisville Metro Police's handling of the growing threat as rioters went on a spree, most of it starting late Friday night. LMPD arrested 136 people in a stretch between May 28 and Monday at 8 p.m., which included some for looting. Most were charged with unlawful assembly and curfew violations, spokesman Dwight Mitchell said. Gant Hill, a commercial real estate broker who manages Kahedy's three large buildings, which house more than 100 tenants, said he rushed to the scene in the wee hours of Saturday morning. Related: Kroger to reopen store that was looted near site of David McAtee's death Maintenance crews hammered boards over damaged windows at the Weissinger-Gaulbert apartments in downtown Louisville after vandals in crowds of protesters smashed windows. (Photo: Courtesy of Gant Hill) He said demonstrators elbowed past him as he and maintenance staff swept up glass — to grab a handful of potato chip bags from the bodega. One guy brazenly walked up and smashed more glass in doors and windows with a machete-looking tool, Hill said. He said that he didn't feel safe confronting anyone and that there were few police in the area. ""I think (Louisville police) have been too quiet,"" Hill said. ""They've not been proactive. They've been reactive. More should have been done before Friday."" At The Watch Shop on Broadway, owner Barry Baker said people smashed through windows and destroyed mini blinds. They toppled a cabinet and cracked hammers over other glass display fronts and counters. Most cases were empty except for some of Baker's wife Chevvy's sterling silver items, which intruders left. ""They didn't take anything,"" they just wanted to create a mess, Baker said. Hill said at one point he spotted a group of men emerge from large vehicles dressed in black and carrying backpacks. They headed into the crowds to begin destroying shops and other property, he said. A TV crew aired a video, which Hill shared on his Facebook page, of one of the men using a hammer to smash a line of windows as he marched along a street. Hill wrote on Facebook ""that peaceful protests have been overshadowed by riots and looting, mainly from professional terrorists that are not from here and are not here on behalf of Breonna."" Greater Louisville Inc., the metro's chamber of commerce, released a statement from president and CEO Sarah Davasher-Wisdom pledging more involvement by the group: ""We recognize the anger and frustration that has been building in our region and our nation in response to violent acts against communities of color. ""Greater Louisville must come together to strengthen the ties within our community, embrace diversity and seek meaningful change to build a truly inclusive economy. In the coming days and weeks, GLI will continue our outreach to business and community leaders so we can learn ways to impact change and contribute toward meaningful discussions about race and inequities in our region.” See also: Viral crowdfund raises more than $200,000 for David McAtee's family For his part, Kahdey worries that a $100,000 estimate for new glass and other repairs won't touch the real loss: the trust and confidence of residents and other tenants who may decide they'd rather move from downtown. The unrest may reverse years of work to make the Central Business District a vibrant, attractive place. ""It's the business owners that are have been left to pick up the pieces,"" he said. Baker, who joined the enterprise founded by his uncle more than 30 years ago, predicted the shop could struggle to recover. But he's determined that it will see its 80th anniversary this year even if it means keeping retail customers away and focusing on his wholesale trade. He was humbled recalling the kindness of strangers who stopped in early Saturday morning to lend a hand, sweeping up glass and helping restore order. A guy named Rex worked for more than two hours, Baker said. He said he handed $50 cash to Rex when he took off only to have the man return moments later and hand the bills back. He told Baker: ""I can't in good conscience take the money."" How can businesses get help? Greater Louisville Inc., the metro chamber of commerce, has circulated that “if your business was damaged as a result of the destruction over the recent days, you may qualify for a low-interest SBA loan.

Louisville Courier Journal Gov. Andy Beshear spoke with frustration about the fatal shooting of a black man in the West End on Monday morning, calling it ""unacceptable"" that Louisville police officers involved did not have their body cameras turned on during the interaction. ""After everything that's happened, this can't happen,"" Beshear said Monday afternoon. ""It shouldn't have."" The man who was killed was David McAtee, the popular owner of a barbecue business next to the Dino's Food Mart parking lot, McAtee's nephew told The Courier Journal. The shooting occurred around 12:15 a.m. at the site, which is near 26th and Broadway. Here are five key takeaways from what Beshear said over the course of his two press conferences, which were held on the same day McAtee died. 'My son didn't hurt nobody': David McAtee, business owner, killed by authorities Beshear wants all body camera footage to be reviewed In his first press conference, Beshear called for Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and LMPD to publicly release video of Monday's shooting ""as soon as possible."" But Fischer said in a Monday afternoon press conference that the officers involved did not have their body cameras activated — which led to Fischer firing Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad, who planned to step down by the end of June. Fischer showed video footage from nearby pole cameras as well as police radio transmissions during his briefing. Beshear subsequently said he wants the Kentucky State Police to review the body cameras of all officers on the scene. ""It is unacceptable that the officers that responded last night did not have body cameras on and recording,"" Beshear said late Monday afternoon. ""This is the entire reason that we have those cameras, and every other officer's camera should be reviewed and if they captured any part of the scene, it ought to be released."" Related: Investigation launched into fatal shooting of West End restaurant owner State police team is investigating Beshear indicated he quickly pushed for the Kentucky State Police to investigate Monday's shooting and said a team from that agency is doing so. ""I've been in the office since 4:15 this morning reaching out to different groups involved and calling for the Kentucky State Police to be involved with either an independent investigation or direct oversight of this investigation,"" he said Monday morning. ""The group that is on the ground from the Kentucky State Police is the group that investigates shootings in other police units across the state,"" he continued. ""They are the independent group that does this and they are the only independent group that I have to directly call on to investigate."" Beshear promised a ""swift investigation"" Monday afternoon and said that the KSP team that's handling it will ""let people know the truth"" and ""truly seek justice."" Beshear says Fischer 'needs to look really hard' at Breonna Taylor case On top of expressing anger over the lack of body camera footage in the shooting of McAtee, Beshear also said it is ""unacceptable"" how long it is taking the Louisville Metro Police Department to investigate the officers who shot and killed Breonna Taylor in her own home. An attorney for Taylor's family said Monday he was told that the investigation into the LMPD officers' conduct in her March 13 shooting could take two to three more months. ""It's unacceptable that Breonna Taylor's family has been apparently told it would take months to finish the rest of the investigation,"" Beshear said. When asked about Fischer's handling of the matter, Beshear said the Louisville mayor ""needs to look really hard"" at the case. ""I have not seen that file, or that investigation but I think it requires a very close look,"" Beshear said. Attorney: Breonna Taylor shooting investigation could take 2 to 3 more months CLOSE David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue business in western Louisville, was known as a ""community pillar,"" said his mother, Odessa Riley. Louisville Courier Journal Officers were responding to curfew violation Beshear provided details Monday morning about the information he has received so far about the McAtee case, although he stressed that the facts are still being determined. Beshear said it appears the authorities were responding to a violation of the curfew public officials instituted in Louisville but that it doesn't appear the people at 26th and Broadway were part of the protests. ""At least what I'm told, I don't think it was even a demonstration. I think it was a gathering,"" he said. ""And again, we want to get to all the facts, but my understanding is that the conversations weren't even tense once people arrived. ""But that's when at least a shot, if not multiple shots, were fired on LMPD and the National Guard,"" he continued. ""At least what we believe happened is that the National Guard, the police and the crowd that was still with them, in part, were all fired upon."" After that happened, he said it's his understanding that shots were fired by LMPD and a couple of members of the National Guard. Those Guard members both were ""pulled off of that direct duty while we are determining what happened."" National Guard not recalled Beshear said the plan is to maintain a similar presence of the National Guard in Louisville to ""ensure that we keep order."" He also said new guidelines will be instituted for the Guard but declined to say whether those will include restricting or prohibiting them from deploying to the West End. He acknowledged he's responsible for sending the National Guard to the city to assist the police during the protests. ""And I don't want anybody hurt in all of this, and that's why we've got to look really carefully at what happened last night because someone was hurt,"" he said. ""There was obviously a shooting and we have a death, and we've got to know all the facts about it.""

Floyd, 46, died Monday after being stopped by Minneapolis police investigating a reported forgery. Video from the scene showed former police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on a handcuffed Floyd's neck as Floyd cried out, saying he couldn't breathe. Chauvin, 44, was arrested Friday on charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Burica said he doesn't normally comment on things occurring outside the village. ""However, with the recent incident in Minneapolis, I think it's important to let our community and the public know that what happened in the situation involving George Floyd is vile, inexcusable and sickening,"" Burica said on Facebook. ""No one deserves to be treated so cruelly and with such disregard for human life. Although I do not have all the facts and I do not know what lead up to the incident, I do know that the outcome of what I saw was not a police tactic or a rational response to that incident or any incident."" Protests have started all over the country, including in Chicago. In Chicago, videos and photos showed protesters clashing with police — and one incident in which some demonstrators formed a circle to protect officers who were seen being dragged by other protesters. ""This incident has affected many as it should. A man has senselessly died, which has resulted in many communities to be in a state of bedlam,"" Burica said. ""These officer's contempt for this life, is both disheartening and nauseating.

Mayor Fischer said the curfew will last for two days. LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Governor Andy Beshear announced Saturday morning that he is calling up the National Guard to help keep peace in Louisville. This comes in response to a second night of protests in downtown Louisville which saw the destruction of property throughout downtown and looting of stores. ""The demonstrations in Louisville have all started peacefully but what we have seen last night and what our intelligence says is going to happen tonight are outside groups moving in trying to create violence to harm everybody who is on those streets,"" Beshear said. Additionally a dusk to dawn curfew will be implemented, according to Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. “The tone clearly changed last night, the number of people on our street clearly changed last night as well. And this turned from being a peaceful protest into violence and terrorism and looting in the streets of our city,"" Fischer said in a press briefing Saturday morning. The implementation of a dust to dawn curfew will be in effect for at least two days. A significant amount of protesters are not from Louisville, Louisville Metro Police and Fischer said during a press conference early Saturday morning. “Out-of-towners are here, anarchists intending to destroy our city. Louisvillians have to make it clear to them that they are not us, they do not represent the soul of city, they do not represent our intentions to peacefully protest in our city. They do not represent what Breonna Taylor would want as well,"" Fischer said. LMPD Special Advisor Jessie Halladay said officers were overwhelmed last night and surrounded. “These guys were taking Molotov cocktails and they were trying to not create a situation in which other people were injured,” Halladay said. People came downtown Saturday morning to check out the aftermath of Friday night’s events. But Mayor Fischer says the best way people can help is by staying away. “If you’re a Louisvillian and you want to help us right now, what you can do is stay home and encourage your friends and family to stay home and work for justice in orderly ways,” Fischer said. According to Halladay, police made six arrests last night in connection with the protest. Halladay also confirmed that the six officers were injured with two suffering showing concussion symptoms.

Matt Kaufmann, who teaches in Jefferson County Public Schools, was booked Sunday night on an unspecified misdemeanor charge, according to the Department of Corrections booking log. An arrest citation was not immediately available. ""(Kaufmann) was arrested this evening for protesting and standing up for #BreonnaTaylor and for Black Lives in Louisville,"" local activist Hannah Drake wrote on Facebook.

The demonstrations over the death of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor, an unarmed black woman shot during a police raid in March, were mostly peaceful. But a spree of vandalism and looting damaged businesses downtown and in selected locations around the city. Here is his first-person account, first posted on Facebook, of what happened: I have always been an advocate for the fair treatment and equal rights for all individuals. As a member of a minority group because of my sexual orientation, and having been the chairman for the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights for 10 years, I have an understanding of the need to expose and work for change in regards to inequality and unwarranted oppression. Through several decades, I have been the owner and developer of several downtown businesses. Over 20 years ago, I had a dream of recapturing a bygone vibrant Fourth Street. Successfully contributing to that dream, I developed the old Kentucky Theater on Fourth Street into a multi-business facility with a Bagel & Coffee shop, Marketplace restaurant, Theater Square Wine & Spirits, a yoga studio and also law offices. On Friday evening I experienced what I have never experienced. I watched as an attempt to destroy the dream took place. A protest started out with a tone of peaceful demonstration. It was heartwarming to see the hundreds of people that supported the rightful cause. You may like: Downtown Louisville may be cleaned up, but you can't power wash away 'Justice for Breonna' However, individuals bearing hammers, baseball bats, and who knows what else they had in their backpacks, had absolutely no intention of keeping it a focused and peaceful demonstration. I view those individuals that were in the black Ninja outfits and toting weapons as nothing more than opportunist vandals and thieves. Along with many other businesses and properties in downtown Louisville, our property and business — The Marketplace Restaurant and Theater Square Wine and Spirits — were vandalized and looted. I was notified by the alarm company that the alarm at the Marketplace Wine Shop was going off. I rushed to the Wine Shop to find the large storefront windows busted out, (with) groups of masked individuals crawling in and out of the windows with hands and arms filled with bottles of wine, spirits and other merchandise. The individuals were not just one gender or one race. However, It did seem that the majority were juveniles or young adults. I started grabbing the product from their hands. As I went to grab a basket that one of them had filled with product, I was attacked from the back and knocked to the ground by two others. Two African American men persuaded the men to stop their attack on me. Bleeding, sore and fearing for my life, I retreated to the car and locked the doors as I watched the destruction and thievery by hooded, masked thieves continue. Read this: Mayor Fischer says Louisville welcomes peaceful protest. Why was one cleared with tear gas? There was nothing I could do. I finally left and went home leaving the devastation physically, but mentally it wouldn’t leave my mind. I got very little sleep. George Stinson, who owns Marketplace restaurant and nearby shops on Fourth Street, got a needed assist from two men as he tried unsuccessfully to stop looters last weekend. (Photo: Courtesy of George Stinson) In the morning, I went back to Marketplace and got the full picture of the destruction. It was major damage and major theft. I called to have the building secured and boarded up. I started sweeping up the broken glass. Amid all of this horribleness, I looked up and saw strangers, various races and ages, with dustpans and brooms in their hands, going to businesses asking if they could help in the cleanup. These were the local Louisvillians wanting to help. This hit me right in the heart. This was the Louisville that I have always known and loved. Yes, the experience was horrific, but the care and concern shown by my fellow Louisvillians gave me that hope again that we will continue to get through trying situations together. To those kind individuals, thank you for caring.

After four nights of protests in response to the death of Breonna Taylor — during which stores were looted and seven people were shot — it's a question that's come to the top of many minds. More: After nights of protest, Louisville is hurting. Where does the city go from here? The Courier Journal spent Sunday speaking with more than a dozen community leaders and members about what they think needs to happen next for the city to move forward. Here's what they said. Neeli Bendapudi, president of the University of Louisville ""We have a long way left to go as a country, commonwealth, city and university. Zip codes cannot dictate education, health and well being, inter-generational wealth transfers — and they do, now. It is important that we use this moment to take an honest, uncomfortable look at the systemic drivers of inequity and address them. At the university, we need to do the same. ""Community leaders need to make sure that the fierce urgency of now is not quickly forgotten."" Rev. Frank Smith, Interdenominational Ministerial Coalition Louisville's protests are ""a consequence of people who have ignored the persistent cries from the black community. “This city rushes to complete the projects and developments that suit its wealthy and its affluent, especially those east of Ninth Street."" Meanwhile, infrastructure is halted and delayed in the West End. Windows are boarded up regularly, he said. Smith called for Louisville to create a government aid program that would be ""singularly focused, priority funding for the development of the black communities of Louisville.” “We have not progressed any further over 400 years because there are policies that continue to put the knee on the neck of the black community,” Smith said. Angela Parsons, principal of the J. Graham Brown School Vandals involved in this weekend's protests made it clear it didn't matter what they were destroying when they spray painted and smashed windows at the Brown School. Sunday, as Jefferson County Public School employees worked to erase the vulgarity and destruction from the property, the school’s leader reassured students, parents and alumni of the value of human life over physical objects. “Our school is not this building, our school is made up of a diverse body of beautiful souls,” Parsons wrote in a Facebook post Sunday morning. “Some of our school family is suffering as are members of our greater community. The suffering of people angers me, not this vandalism.” The Brown School, which teaches kindergarten through 12th grade, is home to 743 students, 30% of whom are African American. “It is my great honor to care for these children for 13 years,” Parsons told the Courier Journal. “From the beginning of their time at this school until they graduate, we teach racial equity. And moving forward, we will continue to adhere to those values and the belief that every life matters and deserves to be heard, respected and valued.” More: Investigation launched into LMPD, National Guard fatal shooting of West End restaurant owner Jecorey Arthur, Metro Council District 4 candidate ""It will be impossible as a city or a state or a country to move forward in the future if we don't address and redress and resolve our past. ""It's going to take a holistic, systematic reset. Not only organizing in the streets, but also organizing in the classroom."" Change won't happen overnight, Arthur said, using the example of a hurt thumb. ""It took less than a second for my thumb to get damaged but days for it to heal. ... Imagine how long it will take after 400 years"" of injustice against black people, he said. ""The work we're doing now, I may have to pass off to my 2-year-old. He might be marching in 50 years like we are this week."" Stephen George, president and general manager of Louisville Public Media George was on the hunt for plywood Saturday after windows at the historic Louisville Public Media building were shattered amid Friday's protest. While plywood was important in the short term, George said he’s more focused on the long-term ramifications of the weekend protests and how his media outlet can work to build a stronger community. “From my perspective as a business leader in the city and as a white person, I think it is very important to listen to what our black friends are saying right now, both on the streets during these protests and in our daily lives,” he said. One way Louisville Public Media has already been working to ensure all voices in Louisville are being heard by tracking the diversity of its sources and how they represent those sources. “It’s just one way that we hold ourselves accountable to our mission,” he said, “the mission of being representative of the voices throughout our entire community and to be equitable in how we report on our community."" Also: Mayor says most protesters arrested at demonstrations live in Louisville Sarah Burbank, MacKenna Williams and Jacob Grant, students at South Oldham High School “We talk about this like the rioting is not American,” said Burbank, 17. “But a police system that's not accountable to anything is not American either… The most un-American thing that we could possibly have is a police system where it was ever allowed that they could just go into someone's house, and then that person could end up dead in the middle of the night.” After attending Saturday's protest, the high school students swept glass from Fourth Street on Sunday. The protests were about peace and unity, they said. They came from a place of hurt and “generations of terrorism.” Williams said her brother, who is Guatemalan, is already scared to go out at night for fear of running into police officers. And Grant said he was always told “don’t go west of nine.” Instead, through his work with the Kentucky YMCA program, he volunteered in the West End. He wanted to understand the separation, he said, and to understand what ""100 years of redlining"" does to a city. “It's really hard to see that and look at like, this is where I live. ... I'm benefiting from (this) system,” he said. Bayley Amburgey, recent graduate of the University of Louisville Ahead of Friday's protest, Amburgey made a call for monetary donations on her Instagram. She gathered $1,000 in less than a few hours, which she spent on water and other supplies for the hundreds of protesters who eventually hit the city's streets. The 21-year-old was overwhelmed by the show of support that the donations provided. But she was also overwhelmed by what she saw as the protest turned chaotic. White men intentionally provoked the police, she said, and refused to stop after she and her friends begged them to. A woman fell to the ground after being hit with a tear gas canister. Amburgey attempted to help by bringing the woman a mix of water and baking soda. But her throat began to close up, and she struggled to breathe. She had to leave. Amburgey's advice now to other young people and everyone who's angry is to educate themselves before marching into the streets. ""Go to things that Black Lives Matter sponsors,"" she said. ""They are adhering to the nonviolent principles. They've been trained by the people before us. ... If we're going to keep protesting, we have to be strategized and be organized. We have to be deliberate and intentional with every action that we do. ""It makes no sense to put black bodies in front of the police with no plan."" Amburgey said she's participated in activist training through Black Lives Matter Louisville, and she encourages others to do the same. Because even after the protests are over, the work won't be done. ""This is also a system that we're trying to take down,"" she said. ""We have to remember, this is a greater scheme."" David Jones Jr., former JCPS board member The turmoil of the late 1960s and the efforts of the Kerner Commission to investigate the causes of the 1967 race riots came to mind for businessman David Jones Jr. “I hear the unheeded warnings of the Kerner Commission that ‘our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white — separate and unequal.’ I hear Langston Hughes’ searing italics telling us that a dream too long deferred will explode,” Jones said. “The only today wisdom I can quote comes from Killer Mike’s plea to Atlanta: ‘It is not time to burn down your own home (but) to plot, plan, strategize, organize and mobilize ... If we burn down Atlanta, what have we got?’ If we burn down Louisville, what have we got?” Louisville councilman: I am 'begging' for officers in Breonna Taylor shooting to resign Christy Brown, philanthropist Brown, who owns the Republic Building on Fifth Street downtown, said she went to the property Saturday morning to meet a crew that was boarding it up. Nearby, the crew built a box around a statue of Mother Catherine Spalding to keep it safe from any damage. “We are a resilient enough community to figure out how to translate what’s happened into methods of learning and transformation,"" Brown said. “We must make sure our whole city understands this pain. We can’t be a city where people don’t feel safe because they are black — or any other reason. It’s important that we all see it and say it out loud. We can’t skip this step and our police must understand deeply that they are an essential part of the solutions.” Reach reporter Bailey Loosemore at bloosemore@courier-journal.com, 502-582-4646 or on Twitter @bloosemore.

Appearing on Kentucky Educational Television about three weeks before the primary, McGrath, Charles Booker and Mike Broihier answered questions on issues including racial and income inequality, gun rights and the unrest embroiling the state’s largest city. Booker and Broihier stressed their progressive credentials, with both supporting a universal basic income. McGrath, widely seen as the favorite among a pack of Democrats vying to challenge McConnell in November, played up her differences with the Republican. She accused the veteran senator of having a “long history of undermining unions” and said he has resisted efforts to lower prescription drug prices. “I’m not a polished politician,” McGrath said. “I’m somebody who looks at things through the lens of being a wife and being a mother and being a United States Marine.” Responding to the criticism, McConnell campaign manager Kevin Golden said in a statement that McGrath was “obviously told by her Washington, D.C., Democratic handlers that insincere and inauthentic political pablum is the best way to hide her extremist views.” Monday live updates: Fischer praises peaceful protesters at Dino's Food Mart The latest: LMPD officer in fatal shooting of David McAtee had mocked protester on Facebook The three contenders are among a number of Democrats running for their party’s nomination in the June 23 primary to challenge McConnell, who is seeking a seventh term. Early questions during the hourlong Democratic forum focused on the waves of protests that hit Louisville since last week. Booker and Broihier said National Guard soldiers should be pulled back after a fatal shooting while authorities were enforcing a curfew in Louisville. The decision to call in the Guard was made by a fellow Democrat, Gov. Andy Beshear, in an effort to quell violence amid a series of protests in Kentucky’s largest city. Booker, a state lawmaker from Louisville, said the Guard was sent in “like a military force as if they are at war with taxpaying citizens.” He said there are many good people in law enforcement but said the Guard’s presence escalated tensions in Louisville. “They took an adversarial posture, a confrontational posture to people that are hurting and demanding to be accounted for,” he said. Broihier also said he thinks the Guard should be called off, saying they were placed in a “very sensitive and difficult operation.” Broihier — whose broad resume includes a career as a Marine officer, farmer and small-town newspaperman — called for a demilitarization of police forces.

It sets the wrong mindset. And the police, they think they’re at war. In war you need an enemy. And the enemy, sadly, too many times, are African-Americans.” McGrath, a former Marine combat pilot, accused McConnell of not being focused on his constituents. “He is somebody who is constantly pushing for dysfunction when somebody of the other party is in power,” McGrath said. “That’s why he’s so bad for Kentucky and our country.” McGrath said she would be willing to work with President Donald Trump, if he is re-elected, on legislation to improve infrastructure. But she also said Trump’s trade war was hurting Kentucky. Broihier said the severe economic downturn amid the coronavirus pandemic has shown the need for a single-payer health care system. “We have a health care system that’s tied to employment,” he said. “And we’ve just put 40 million Americans on unemployment.” McGrath said she would favor a public option that allows patients to buy into a federal plan or keep their employer insurance if they favor it. In touting a universal basic income, Booker said: “If we want to break the cycle of poverty, we need to make sure people have the financial freedom to make decisions in their lives. We know that we can afford to do it because, honestly, we can’t afford not to do it.” Read or Share this story: https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2020/06/02/kentucky-senate-race-democrats-discuss-louisville-protests-mcconnell/5315176002/",0.0

Police seemed to pull back, allowing a crowd of hundreds to peacefully walk through the streets of the city unbothered. This apparent change of tactic follows the police killing of David McAtee, a west Louisville business owner shot around 12:15 a.m. Monday when Louisville Metro Police Department and the Kentucky National Guard arrived to break up a gathering after curfew. Officers from both LMPD and the National Guard fired at McAtee. Authorities released a video on Tuesday they allege shows McAtee fired first. Following McAtee’s shooting death, Gov. Andy Beshear announced Tuesday that he would reduce the National Guard presence in Louisville. Though LMPD made no similar statements, Tuesday evening’s response to a demonstration represented a clear departure from the previous days’ tactics of dispersing protesters with tear gas, pepper balls and flash-bangs. Mayor Greg Fischer came out to talk with protesters where they had gathered at Jefferson Square around 6 p.m. Afterwards, a handful of officers moved through the crowd, sans riot gear. They stopped and spoke with protesters, including Charnette Batty. She’d been at the protests every day but this was the first time she’d felt safe talking with an officer. “It was just nice to have a conversation with someone in uniform after these last couple of days feeling like no one was on my side,” she said. “I think it’s really healing to be able to talk to officers. They’re all just normal human beings. It’s all about the training and conditioning.” Batty asked the officers if she could sing to them. As she sang a hymn — “Let there be peace on Earth, and let it begin with me” — the whole park gathered to listen. Police officers were surrounded by hundreds of protesters, but if they were worried, you couldn’t tell. One of them swayed to the music. Another cheered when Batty hit a high note. After the gathering in Jefferson Square Park the demonstrators embarked on what would become an epic walk around the city of Louisville, while law enforcement made themselves scarce. Police and the Kentucky National Guard gathered in potential protest hotspots, but stayed out of the way of the protesters. The demonstrators remained peaceful as they marched around downtown, through Butchertown, Phoenix Hill, the Highlands. They blocked streets — but let cars through as needed. They honked, chanted and played music from the cars that soon joined the walking tour. LMPD spokesperson Jessie Halladay said in an email that the police had not fired any tear gas or other munitions as of midnight Tuesday, because they had not seen any destructive or violent behavior. For many protesters, this was a start towards rebuilding trust between law enforcement and the community. Others said it was too little, too late — and several speculated that David McAtee would still be alive if police had taken this more conciliatory approach from the start. But either way, everyone seemed happy to have a night off from the tear gas and the pepper balls. Without law enforcement to worry about, the crowd walked for hours around the city, eventually ending up at 26th and Broadway, where McAtee was killed. At one point, right around midnight, police and protesters did intersect, just as the crowd made its way back downtown. It was briefly tense, but then the officers stepped out of the way, allowing the crowd to continue their march in peace.",0.0

When the police would show up for a meal, the men would retreat inside the shop to avoid the officers. McAtee, though, would laugh and cut up with the officers, sneaking glances at the men taking cover inside. Afterwards, McAtee would step into the shop, beaming with a big smile on his face, asking the men why they didn’t like good friends. “I’d tell him, ‘What you mean, why I don’t like your friends?’” said one of the young men, who goes by Snow. “I don’t like the police.” But McAtee did. On Monday, McAtee was killed in a barrage of bullets fired by the Louisville Metro Police and the National Guard. Law enforcement came to the intersection of 26th Street and Broadway to disperse a crowd that was gathered there after curfew. Police officials say McAtee stepped out of his small barbecue shop and fired a gun; the officers and Guard members returned fire and killed McAtee. “He thought they were his friends, and they killed him,” said Snow. He was one of thousands who went to the 26th and Broadway intersection over the past two nights to pay respects to McAtee, the man everyone knew as Yaya and the purveyor of Yaya’s BBQ. His death was initially discussed as an unfortunate tragedy by police and Mayor Greg Fischer. But on Tuesday, the officials released surveillance footage from inside Yaya’s shop that they say shows that McAtee was the person who fired a gun, leading officers to shoot back. The video shows a crowd of people running into the shop as the police and National Guard were moving through the area. McAtee heads to the door and appears at one point to grip a pistol he keeps on his hip. He briefly steps outside the door and then returns to the shop and collapses on the floor. The video does not clearly show McAtee firing rounds at police. A gun is on the floor near the doorway, and a woman standing nearby points at it as he lay on the ground. The video, however, and the implication that McAtee contributed to his own death, didn’t change their opinions or affect their grief. “Oh my god, I’m going to miss him, I’m going to really miss him,” said Frances McAtee, his cousin, as she worked the grill outside the shop Tuesday evening. Frances said she and her cousin were the cooks of the family. They always gravitated to the kitchen or the grill and they bonded while preparing feasts for the annual family reunion. This year, though, Frances said she’ll be on her own, and it won’t be the same. “You’ll see me with a sad face,” she said. Though McAtee is gone from the corner barbecue shop, his nephew Marvin McAtee intends to keep the shop operating. He’s worked the shop with McAtee, running the books and keeping the music playing. And said that’s how he will keep his uncle’s legacy alive. On Tuesday he was running around the shop, shaking hands and embracing loved ones, prepping for a celebration of McAtee’s life. Marvin was in the shop with McAtee the night he died. Marvin dismisses police’s claim that uncle was the aggressor. He said a crowd of people were flooding into the shop after the National Guard and police pulled up to the intersection around midnight Monday morning. McAtee was trying to get people out of the shop, keep them away, and protect his business. Marvin believes his uncle was unaware that police and Guard members were on the street with guns at the ready, and when he stepped back out the door, he took a bullet in the chest. “His thing was, nobody can run up in here,” Marvin said. “He has to protect his shit. If they can’t understand that, that’s on them.” Marvin, like many who came to remember McAtee, still wonders why the police came with such aggression, and why the National Guard was there, at all. It’s unclear which agency fired the bullet that killed McAtee. J. Michael Brown, the secretary of the governor’s Executive Cabinet, said the shooting is under investigation. Preliminary finds show at least 18 shots were fired by four law enforcement officers. Marvin said the 26th and Broadway intersection is one of the city’s most dangerous, and he’s seen some crazy incidents over the years. But rarely does he see more than half a dozen or so police respond. “You’re going to bring the National Guard, for a curfew?” he said, shaking his head. “What was the point of making a demonstration for a curfew?” Like Snow, Marvin said McAtee was close to the local police. He respected the police, and cared for the officers that patrolled the streets around his shop. And now, Marvin intends to carry that theme at the shop, and if the police show up looking for a meal, he will shake their hand and give them a burger, just like his uncle would.

But when the Canadian prime minister was asked what he thought of President Trump's actions to quash a wave of protests across the U.S., Trudeau paused before responding – for 21 seconds as the cameras recorded his awkward silence. During a Tuesday news conference in front of his Ottawa residence, the prime minister fielded this question from a reporter: ""You've been reluctant to comment about the words and actions of the U.S. president. But we do have now Donald Trump calling for military action against protesters. We saw protesters tear-gassed yesterday to make way for a presidential photo-op. I'd like to ask you what you think about that. And, if you don't want to comment, what message do you think you're sending?"" Before answering, the prime minister, sporting a beard and shaggy hair since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, glanced down at his lectern, opened his mouth as if to speak — then paused, shifted his weight and uttered a barely audible ""um"" as birds chirped in the background. ""We all watch in horror and consternation what's going on in the United States,"" he finally said. ""It is a time to pull people together, but it is a time to listen. ""It is a time to learn what injustices continue despite progress over years and decades. But it is a time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges,"" he said. ""That black Canadians and racialized Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day,"" Trudeau continued. ""There is systemic discrimination in Canada, which means our systems treat Canadians of color, Canadians who are racialized, as differently than they do others."" Trudeau typically displays reticence on Trump's actions, keeping in mind the centrality of the U.S.-Canada relationship and its huge cross-border economic interdependence. Canada in recent days has seen relatively small, peaceful protests in solidarity with U.S. demonstrations that first erupted last week in the wake of the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. By contrast, the protests in U.S. cities have typically been much larger and have frequently devolved into clashes between police and activists. The Canadian protests supporting Black Lives Matter have sprung up in Montreal, Halifax, Toronto and Regina, the provincial capital of Saskatchewan. At the protest in Regina on Tuesday, when a few hundred people gathered, one of the organizers, Faith Olanipekun, told the CBC that, ""A lot of people here think that Canada isn't racist."" ""So it's important for us to come out, voice our concerns and let people know that we are suffering in Canada just as much as people in the U.S. are suffering,"" Olanipekun said. ",0.0

This marked the third day of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police. (Photo: Albert Cesare / The Enquirer) We have been working constructively on police reform in Cincinnati since before the unrest of 2001. The Cincinnati Black United Front (CBUF) recently conducted a community perception survey as part of the collaborative refresh, and the distrust of police within the local black community is deep, spanning all ages. Protests on our own streets these past few days verify that fact. We offer these concrete observations to help channel the protests triggered by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis into actions that will be transformative for our community. These suggestions only address police accountability. CBUF seeks reforms that address affordable housing, income disparities, health disparities and other forms of injustice. But we cannot get that work done unless vulnerable people are treated fairly by those in power. The challenge of police accountability Cincinnati police arrest a man during wide-spread protests in Cincinnati. People have been outraged by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police. Sunday was the the third day of protests in downtown Cincinnati. (Photo: Liz Dufour/The Enquirer) On July 19, 2015, UC police officer Ray Tensing shot Sam DuBose in the head after ordering him to exit his car. Tensing was tried twice for murder. Twice the jury deadlocked without a conviction. The DuBose family asked the U.S. Department of Justice to review the case. The federal investigation remains open. Criminal charges are the most dramatic means to hold an officer accountable. Nationally, from 2013-2019, officers have only been criminally charged in 1% of the instances where they killed suspects. Very few of those result end in convictions. The officer can also be sued for damages under federal civil rights law and state law. Federal and state claims must overcome the very high bar of immunity. Civil rights lawyers have several cases pending the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to eliminate qualified immunity since it in effect gives every officer one free pass at oppression. Under Ohio state law, the officer will not be liable unless he acted recklessly, wantonly, in bad faith or with malice. Civil verdicts against police for use of force are very rare. An officer can also be disciplined and even fired for using excessive force. This requires a finding that the officer violated the agency use of force policy and/or his use of force training. Most police departments have an internal affairs department that conducts these investigations. Some, like Cincinnati, also have a Civilian Complaint Authority which does an investigation independent of the police department. Many officers like those in Cincinnati and in Minneapolis belong to a union. They can grieve and ultimately seek arbitration of any discipline regarding use of force. Arbitrators generally have labor law backgrounds and are not accountable to the public. Officers fare very well in arbitration. In fact, the University of Cincinnati was so reluctant to go to arbitration against Tensing that they settled his labor grievance and paid him over $340,000. The DuBose family and many in the community were outraged and discouraged. In Cincinnati, we must act now to improve police accountability against these odds. Cincinnati SWAT arrives on the scene as protesters gather at Washington Park in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati on Saturday, May 30, 2020. Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of Over-the-Rhine and downtown in solidarity with protesters in other US cities, speaking out against police brutality. (Photo: Sam Greene/The Enquirer) The response we need in Cincinnati Here are a few ways to make that happen: Fully staff the Citizens Complaint Authority and stop blocking investigations. In Cincinnati, unless the officer interview has not yet been concluded, the police chief generally releases video footage of use of force and holds a press conference within 24 hours of the event. That is very important to reducing rumors and sharing basic facts of each event. By ordinance and under the Collaborative Agreement, the CCA has 90 days to complete its independent professional review of each use of force. In recent months, the CCA has been understaffed and it has failed to meet this deadline. This is disturbing because discipline is supposed to be delayed until the CCA recommendation is completed. It is also troubling because CCA is supposed to study trends and propose changes in policies and training where systems have broken down. That work is not getting done. In recent months, Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters has not cooperated with the CCA and blocked officer interviews in many cases. The city and the Cincinnati Black United Front challenged that tactic and prevailed in the Ohio Supreme Court, so now the officers should be interviewed in a timely fashion again. Citizens should demand full funding and full staffing for CCA and make sure that it gets all its work done in a timely fashion.

Under the Collaborative, problem solving is the primary strategy for promoting public safety. This means that problems like open-air drug dealing will be first addressed through stakeholder teams that draw from neighbors, social service agencies and various city departments to develop solutions that address the root of the problem. This strategy has reduced arrests and, therefore, reduced use of force. But problem-solving needs advocates from the community and in recent years it has not been promoted widely. That is a major goal of the refresh, but the collaborative refresh is stalled. We need to recommit to problem solving.

That is a major goal of the refresh, but the collaborative refresh is stalled. We need to recommit to problem solving. Eliminate racial bias. Training is the third key to reducing excessive force. Cincinnati recently amended the use of force policy to require deescalation as part of the toolbox when suspects are approached. Cincinnati has also deployed body cams to make interactions subject to review. Scenario training that engages members of vulnerable populations, such as the mentally ill, help ground that training in the reality on the street. These arrests will not have community support, however, if they are imposed on blacks in a disparate manner. This has been the case for years and the Collaborative required tracking by race and by officer. These efforts were disbanded by the city over the objection from the Black United Front and others. Vigorous training must proceed and robust and accurate tracking of arrests by race must resume now to build any community trust in police. City funding and our community focus must be directed immediately to transparency, full CCA funding, problem solving, proper training and racial bias tracking. That will provide a solid basis for police accountability and allow us to address the other forms of injustice in our community. The heart-breaking events in Minneapolis should help us see the wisdom of this course in Cincinnati. Al Gerhardstein is a civil rights attorneys at Gerhardstein & Branch Co. LPA.

Many of the protests broke out in places where the virus is still circulating widely in the population. In fact, an Associated Press review found that demonstrations have taken place in every one of the 25 U.S. communities with the highest concentrations of new cases. Some have seen major protests over multiple days, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The protests have come just as communities across the nation loosen restrictions on businesses and public life that have helped slow the spread of the virus, deepening concern that the two factors taken together could create a national resurgence in cases. “As a nation, we have to be concerned about a rebound,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser warned Sunday after days of protests rocked the nation’s capital. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo bemoaned the crowds, saying that hundreds could potentially have been infected, undoing months of social distancing. A fresh outbreak in the places where protesters gathered could lead to reinstituting shutdowns. The AP’s review focused on large metro counties — the central counties within metro areas with more than 1 million people — that showed the highest rates of new cases per capita over the past 14 days. While case numbers and deaths have been trending down in several of the cities where the largest protests have occurred, the number of people in those places infected with the virus — and with the ability to spread it — remains high. And in some of the communities, such as Minneapolis, the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has been rising. Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes, even as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Minneapolis has been ground zero for the sprawling protests, which have crossed the Mississippi River into neighboring St. Paul. The unrest has coincided with “the very worst days of the pandemic so far” in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “Our ICU bed care is at its all-time high and is really on the edge,” he said. Ramsey and Hennepin counties, home to the Twin Cities, ranked seventh and eighth for the highest per capita new cases in the AP analysis. Each has seen more than 250 cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks, together reporting nearly 2,000 new cases in the last week alone. Experts point out that other factors associated with protests could accelerate the spread of the virus. For instance, tear gas can cause people to cough and sneeze, as can the smoke from fires set by people bent on destruction. And both also prompt protesters to remove their masks. Crowding protesters who have been arrested into jail cells can also increase the risk of contagion. An AP tally found that, thus far, more than 5,600 people have been taken into custody. Protesters and police shouting at one another nose-to-nose also is raising alarms. Osterholm and other public health experts note, however, that the protests aren’t necessarily as alarming as other events that could fuel new cases because they take place outside and many people are wearing masks. In some cases, hand sanitizer also is being informally distributed. And Dr. David Eisenman, director of the Center for Public Health and Disasters at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said he feared partisan forces might accuse cities of bringing fresh cases on themselves. “I’m actually more worried about how, if those spikes occur, how that information will be weaponized against the notion of protests,” he said. Eisenman called protesting an “essential activity,” possible to practice with reduced risk. He said his grown children protested in Los Angeles and are taking safety precautions now, including isolating themselves at home. They plan to get tested for COVID-19 in about a week. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the hospitalizations for coronavirus in the Washington metro area have been on the decline but that she knows that could change. “There are a lot of unknowns about what happens next,” she said. Wen was the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore during the 2015 uprising after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody and said many health clinics were closed and pharmacies burned down, making it difficult for members of disadvantaged communities to access health care. It’s a concern for her now, too. “You will have compounded health issues that go beyond COVID-19,” she said. Public health experts said it will take two to three weeks to know whether the protests cause a surge in coronavirus cases. And even then, they can’t definitively tie it to the demonstrations. The unrest is happening in tandem with the reopening of gyms, hair salons, restaurants, parks and beaches. It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. In Los Angeles, barbershops and in-person dining were allowed to resume last weekend, just as protests descended into destruction and more than 1,000 people were arrested. Nearly 10,000 new cases have been reported in Los Angeles County in the past week. Hundreds of people also were arrested in Chicago, where Cook County has had among the highest per capita rates of new cases of any large county in the nation, with 283 new cases per 100,000 population in the past two weeks. “The absolute number of cases is still high. We feel good about the fact that we’ve established a decreasing incidence, but we have a ways to go,” said Dr. Ronald Hershow the director of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Hershow and others noted that the racial disparities laid bare by coronavirus — with communities of color bearing a disproportionate burden of infections and deaths — overlap with the issues being protested on streets across America and around the globe. “Racism kills,” Hershow said. “Sometimes that’s direct, as in the case of George Floyd. And sometimes it’s through a virus like COVID-19.” ___",0.0

Jones defeated fellow council member Heather Robinett. Jones will succeed James Knowles III, who defeated Jones in the 2017 mayoral election and held the office since April 2011. Knowles could not run for re-election due to term limits. Jones will become the first female mayor and the first black mayor in the city's history when she is sworn in. According to her biography on the Ferguson City website, Jones has been a Ferguson resident for more than 40 years. She has a bachelor's degree in chemistry from the University of Missouri — St. Louis and completed training in municipal leadership from the Sue Shear Institute for Women in Public Life at UMSL. Jones is also a pastor in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and is on the boards of the Emerson Family YMCA and of the St. Louis MetroMarket. As a council member, she served on the human rights, traffic, landmarks, senior citizens, parks and West Florissant Business Association boards. After the race was declared Tuesday night, Jones and Robinett shared a moment and said they would continue to work together to improve the city. Heather Robinett has come to congratulate Ella Jones. Jones defeated Robinett to become mayor of Ferguson: pic.twitter.com/NESvYHxZe5 — Jason Rosenbaum (@jrosenbaum) June 3, 2020 Knowles served as the city's mayor for nine years and oversaw a fraught time in the city's history. He rode out weeks of unrest after Michael Brown Jr., an unarmed teenager, was shot and killed by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson. A grand jury and the U.S. Department of Justice declined to prosecute the officer, Darren Wilson, who later resigned. Ferguson is one of the smallest cities in the country to have negotiated a consent decree with the federal government. The document means the City of Ferguson agreed to 133 pages of new policies in hopes of reforming the Ferguson Police Department. More recently, Knowles tamped down rumors about the possible dissolution of the city. Knowles instead said the city is in the best financial shape it's been in since the unrest following Brown's death. Ferguson's mayor has less power than the city manager, but the mayor has the power to shape public perceptions as the ""face"" of the city. The city currently has an interim city manager, Jeffrey Blume, who took the position after De'Carlon Seewood resigned in February 2019. Seewood left the position to take a city manager job in Georgia and is now the deputy city manager in Columbia, Missouri.",0.0

The scene at 26th Street and Broadway, where local barbecue business owner David McAtee was shot and killed by law enforcement personnel early Monday morning in an incident that led to the firing of Louisville's police chief, was almost celebratory, Courier Journal reporter Phillip M. Bailey said, as those in attendance came to remember a West End ""community pillar."" And rallies elsewhere avoided the dramatic clashes with police that had produced some of the defining images of the past week. The protests, sparked off last Thursday in response to the March killing of Breonna Taylor, lasted well past midnight, with one group marching (and driving, with a caravan of cars blaring into the night) from the Highlands down Broadway, past 26th Street and into the heart of the West End. Here's a quick look at some highlights from another busy night in Louisville. Underneath an overpass It was just one moment under an overpass on Broadway, but it felt like a little more. A group of protesters that took to the streets of Louisville late Tuesday night was making its way from the Highlands back downtown when it ran into a large crowd of law enforcement officers in military police gear on the side of the road. It was tense for a moment — Courier Journal reporters Mandy McLaren and Johnathan Bullington said the crowd stopped and chanted toward the police, then knelt in the street. As the two sides got closer, though, they embraced. Police and protesters engaged in high fives and fist bumps, and the crowd kept moving. They worked their way into the West End after midnight, marching into the early morning. After the loss of #BreonnaTaylor and #DavidMcAtee, on this sixth consecutive night of protests, Louisville is trying to heal. #LouisvilleProtestspic.twitter.com/Ae44VE64kz — Mandy McLaren (@mandy_mclaren) June 3, 2020 Mostly peaceful evening Still, the relatively peaceful night had its disruptions. Louisville Metro Police officers shot a man in an area just off Shelbyville Road, away from protests that were occurring downtown. The 25-year-old man did not suffer serious injuries, police said. And the Walgreens at 35th Street and Broadway was hit by looters, police said, around midnight. Celebrating David McAtee's life A crowd spent much of the evening at Dino's Food Mart, the business on the corner of the site of McAtee's death, celebrating his life. More late-breaking news: LMPD officer non-fatally shoots 'distressed' armed man on Ash Glen Road Music blared. Cars drove past and honked at the crowd. And Marvin McAtee, David McAtee's nephew, cooked for those in attendance. Marvin McAtee said he intends to keep David's business, Yaya's BBQ, up and running. Those in the crowd held a candlelight vigil for McAtee around 9:30 p.m. before many packed up and left. Louisville mayor makes an appearance Earlier in the day, amid a crowd of protesters at downtown Louisville's Jefferson Square Park, Mayor Greg Fischer took the mic at his first appearance at one of this week's protests. Fischer on Saturday had said he hadn't attended a protest because he didn't want to be a distraction. But on Tuesday, a day after he'd fired longtime LMPD Chief Steve Conrad, he addressed the crowd, saying systematic changes are needed across the U.S. to combat poverty. There's only so much he can do as mayor, though, he said. He's unable to fire the officers involved in Taylor's shooting — they would not go to jail, he said, they would appeal and be ""back on the job within one week."" Many protesters weren't happy with the answer. Fischer called the national protests of the past week a ""wake-up call"" and added that President Donald Trump's declaration that he would deploy military to cities that are unable to quell protests was ""not appropriate"" and that he should be voted out in November. ""Some of y'all might think I lie all the time,"" Fischer said at one point. ""I think I tell the truth all the time.""

Floyd died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) PHOTO:AP Photo/Evan Vucci Nation's Protests Tuesday Largely Peaceful By The Associated Press WASHINGTON - Protests were largely peaceful and the nation's streets were calmer than they have been in days since the killing of George Floyd set off demonstrations that at times brought violence and destruction along with pleas to stop police brutality and injustice against African Americans. There were scattered reports of looting in New York City overnight, and as of Wednesday morning there had been over 9,000 arrests nationwide since the unrest began following Floyd's death May 25 in Minneapolis. But there was a marked quiet compared with the unrest of the past few nights, which included fires and shootings in some cities. The calmer night came as many cities intensified their curfews, with authorities in New York and Washington ordering people off streets while it was still daylight. A block away from the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed following a crackdown a day earlier when officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove peaceful protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. Tuesday's protesters faced law enforcement personnel who stood behind a black chain-link fence that was put up overnight to block access to the park. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” Pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the crowd Tuesday was peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” Pope Francis on Wednesday called for national reconciliation and peace. Francis said that he has ‘’witnessed with great concern the disturbing social unrest’’ in the United States in recent days. ""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,’’ the pope said during his weekly Wednesday audience, held in the presence of bishops due to coronavirus restrictions on gatherings. Trump, meanwhile, amplified his hard-line calls from Monday, when he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” Thousands of people remained in the streets of New York City Tuesday night, undeterred by an 8 p.m. curfew, though most streets were clear by early Wednesday other than police who were patrolling some areas. Midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Protests also passed across the U.S., including in Los Angeles, Miami, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina and Houston, where the police chief talked to peaceful demonstrators, vowing reforms. “God as my witness, change is coming,” Art Acevedo said. “And we’re going to do it the right way.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd's neck while the handcuffed black man called out that he couldn't breathe. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with murder. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump's threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that tested the nation’s ability to run elections while balancing a pandemic and sweeping social unrest. Joe Biden won hundreds more delegates and was on the cusp of formally securing the Democratic presidential nomination. Also Tuesday, Minnesota opened an investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department has a pattern of discrimination against minorities.",0.0

We want you to continue making your voice heard.”Thousands of protesters remained in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood well after the abolished 9 p.m. curfew Wednesday. Demonstrators carried “Black Lives Matter” signs, called for cutting the police department’s budget and shifting the money to social programs, and chanted for officers to remove their riot gear.Washington Lt. Gov. Cyrus Habib tweeted that he was pleased Seattle had listened and reversed course.“Preemptive curfews were only making things worse. Other cities should do likewise,” he posted.WASHINGTON — Demonstrators marched to the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday night, protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota and demanding that laws be changed to prevent more like it.Along their route from near the White House, there were troops in fatigues and officers from federal agencies keeping watch on the crowd.

Some did, but others said they were returning to the White House. Minneapolis — A full autopsy of George Floyd, the handcuffed black man who died after being restrained by Minneapolis police, was released Wednesday and provides several clinical details, including that Floyd had tested positive for COVID-19.The 20-page report released by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office came with the family’s permission and after the coroner’s office released summary findings Monday that Floyd had a heart attack while being restrained by officers, and classified his May 25 death as a homicide.The report by Chief Medical Examiner Andrew Baker spelled out clinical details, including that Floyd tested positive for COVID-19 on April 3 but appeared asymptomatic. The report also noted Floyd’s lungs appeared healthy but he had some narrowing of arteries in the heart.The county’s earlier summary report listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use under “other significant conditions” but not under “cause of death.” The full report’s footnotes noted that signs of fentanyl toxicity can include “severe respiratory depression” and seizures.--------------------All of the former Minneapolis Police officers charged in connection with the death of George Floyd are now in custody.

Marchers could be heard chanting “black lives matter” and “no justice, no peace.” The march began at the city park, went through downtown and ended back at the Fleming County Justice Center. Every so often, the march would stop and those walking would kneel for a moment of silence. Mondre Saunders, one of the organizers of the march, led the crowd through the streets. He carried a sign that said, “#Black Lives Matter, Bring Peace, #IMatter.” When the crowd kneeled the first time, Saunders led the group in a chant of “I can’t breathe” and “no justice, no peace.” At the end of the march, Mondre Saunders told the crowd that the march was about the kids. “This was for the kids to understand that there are ways to do things,” he said. “We make bad choices and sometimes we make good choices. This is the way things should go — instead of tearing up stuff and burning stuff down. People work hard for stuff and to take it from them; that’s just not it. We’re trying to show you something different than what you see on television. All the cities burning, rioting and looting; it can be done like we did it, peaceful. This is unity in our community. This is a part of us; this is what we do. Everybody you see; we’re all against racism and injustice. Our voices are being heard.” Garry Saunders, Mondre Saunders’ brother, who helped organize the event, said the march was about peace. “We want the kids to realize that we are just once race; we are the human race,” he said. “No matter what color you are, you can come together, work it out and you can work together to make where you live a better place. Bad behavior is a generational thing. It’s passed down more than it’s inherited. Kids are going to do what they see you do, not what you talk about doing. I want to be a leader to my kids and not just talk the talk, but walk the walk. All we want is unity in our community. I want my kids to grow up and have different than what I went through. As adults, we’ve got to be the leader and show our community that we can blossom.” One lady in the crowd stood in front of everyone at the Justice Center to apologize for what she believed to be the failures of her generation. “I’m just an old white lady, but 50 years ago, when I was in high school, I was in a civil rights march,” she said. “I want to know why in the living you-know-what are we still doing this? It breaks my heart. We have failed. My generation has failed you all and I am sorry.” Mondre Saunders responded by telling her that everyone had a hand in it. “To ease your mind a bit, it’s all of us,” he said. “We’ve all contributed in some form and some fashion. Whether we see it or don’t, whether we want to see it or not — look at all these beautiful babies. It’s their time. We need to show them what to do and how to be. We don’t have much left, it’s their time. Let’s be a good example for them.” Jazmine Saunders, 15, who, along with her father and uncle, worked to organize the march, could be heard yelling “what’s his name?” with the crowd responding “George Floyd.” When she would ask “what’s her name?” the crowd yelled “Breonna Taylor.” She carried a sign that said “fight for unity.” “It’s not about trying to be better than anyone; we’re not trying to say we’re better than white people, we just want to be equal and treated like humans. That’s what this march was about today. It’s not about tearing up, looting or destroying, it’s about having unity in our community. We don’t have to feel threatened by police officers. I’m happy they joined us in this march, because that shows everyone in this community cares about us.” Molly Spencer, 16, was among those marching. She carried a sign that said, “Christ and racism don’t mix. You can’t say you love him and hate his creation.” “I carried this because in a lot of communities, the love for God runs thick, but the love for diversity does not. What we’re fighting for today is just that you’ll love everyone the same way. God created us all equal and we should all be treated equally.” Among those marching were several city, county and school officials. Fleming County Sheriff Gary Kinder said he was proud of the way the community supported the march. “It’s about unity in our community,” he said. “I took an oath to defend everyone and that’s what we’re doing. We’re here for people’s constitutional rights. It’s not about color. Everyone is one race. Everybody is created equal. As long as you’re doing things right, everything is fine. I’m proud of the community the way they’ve supported them and I’m proud of the way they got this together. I’m glad they got this done. The community showed up and supported them.” Flemingsburg Police Chief Brian Bowling praised the way the march was handled and the way the community responded. “We were approached by Mr. Saunders and he said he was interested in having a peaceful demonstration that talked about racism and issues we needed to address on the local and national level,” he said. “He wanted to focus on talking to the kids and he wanted positive role models around when he did that. He conducted himself the way we should be conducting ourselves as a nation. He did it in the perfect way. It was a peaceful march and he educated the kids about the way they need to treat each other. I have nothing but praise for him for the way it was handled and I have nothing but praise for our community and the way they supported it.”",0.0

Kentucky Catholic",http://www.rcdok.org/ministries/communications/WKC_online.php,"I join with civic and religious leaders across the United States to pray for peace and healing as our nation faces yet another crisis of racism, violence, and distrust. Yet again we are appalled at the violent death of an unarmed Black man at the hands of police. This has happened all too often in our land; a land that we declare is grounded in justice for all. I extend my prayers and concern for the family and community of Mr. George Floyd and for the repose of his soul. The violence that led to his death was filmed for all to see and sadly looks all too familiar. As noted by Archbishop José H. Gomez, the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Mr. Floyd’s death was “senseless and brutal.” I implore all to heed the calls for an end to the violence that has followed this tragedy. Peaceful demonstrators and protestors have a proper and positive place in our society. It is urgent that our communities’ leaders listen and commit themselves to concrete actions to right the injustices that racism breeds; the most noteworthy among these being violence toward people of color. The violence in American cities in recent days is self-destructive and self-defeating. No good can come from violence and destruction. I add my voice to the voices of law enforcement professionals calling for justice. They are rightly ashamed and saddened by recent events. I believe that the vast majority of police men and women desire to serve and protect, and are to be commended for their generous service. Let us as communities and as a nation now listen to the cries of those burdened every day by the sinful effects of racism. Together we can still build a more just society that will assure life, liberty, and equality for all. Most Reverend William F. Medley Bishop of the Diocese of Owensboro Comunicado sobre el racismo y los disturbios civiles 2 de junio del 2020 Me uno a líderes cívicos y religiosos a través de los Estados Unidos para orar por la paz y por la sanación al momento en que nuestra nación enfrenta de nuevo otra crisis de racismo, violencia y desconfianza. Una vez más estamos horrorizados por la violenta muerte de un afroamericano desarmado a manos de la policía. Esto ha sucedió ya con mucha frecuencia en nuestra tierra, una nación que hemos declarado enraizada en la justicia para todos. Extiendo mis oraciones y preocupación por la comunidad y la familia del señor George Floyd y por el descanso de su alma. La violencia que llevó a su muerte fue grabada para todos observar y tristemente parece una escena muy familiar. Como ha dicho el Arzobispo José H. Gómez, presidente de la Conferencia de Obispos Católicos de los Estados Unidos, la muerte del señor Floyd fue “sin sentido y brutal”. Imploro a todos escuchar los ruegos por un fin a la violencia que ha seguido a esta tragedia. Manifestantes y quienes protestan pacíficamente, tiene un lugar apropiado y positivo en nuestra sociedad. Es urgente que los líderes de nuestras comunidades escuchen y se comprometan ellos mismos en acciones concretas para corregir las injusticias que dan pie al racismo; de más notoriedad entre estos, el ser violentos contra personas de color. La violencia en ciudades estadunidenses en días recientes es auto-destructiva. Nada bueno puede salir de la violencia y la destrucción. Uno mi voz a las voces de los profesionales del cuidado del orden, haciendo un llamado a la justicia. Con derecho sienten vergüenza y tristeza por los eventos recientes. Yo creo que la gran mayoría de la policía, hombres y mujeres, desean servir y proteger, y deben ser elogiados por este generoso servicio. Que como comunidades y como nación, ahora escuchemos los llantos de aquellos cargados con el pecaminoso efecto del racismo a diario. Juntos aún podemos construir una sociedad más justa que puede garantizar la vida, libertad, y equidad para todos. Mons. William F. Medley Obispo de la Diócesis de Owensboro",0.0

Handy was found to have coerced a confession from Chandler, who spent nine years behind bars for the 1993 murder of Brenda Whitfield before he was cleared in 2009 with the help of then-new fingerprint technology. The city paid Chandler an $8.5 million settlement after his lawyers showed Handy fed Chandler facts to use in his confession and taped over surveillance video that might have pointed to the real killer. Handy is to be sentenced July 28 by Jefferson Circuit Judge Olu Stevens, who took his plea remotely by video. The first-degree perjury charge, a felony, carried a sentence of one to five years in prison, but special prosecutor Shane Young is recommending a five-year sentence that would be suspended for five years. If Stevens imposes it, Handy would avoid prison time. Young said in an email that it was a ""fair and just disposition."" ""What the victim got to hear today was the defendant take responsibility for what he had done, which was nearly 25 years too late,"" Young said. ""I truly hope this has brought some peace and closure to the victim in this case."" Also: Was prosecutors' investigation into ex-detective Mark Handy a 'farce'? Buy Photo Edwin Chandler broke down in tears in 2009 when he was exonerated on a charge of murder (Photo: Courier Journal) One of Chandler’s lawyers, Nick Brustin, said Chandler and his other attorney, Larry Simon, are ""relieved to see detective Handy finally face some small measure of accountability for his crimes against innocent people.” But in a statement, Brustin said the killings of Breonna Taylor and David McAtee, the “false arrest and assault of Kenneth Walker, and the continuing pattern of lying to avoid responsibility make clear that little has changed since Handy's flagrant lies in the 1990's. The traditions of racism, dishonesty and violence remain alive and well in the Louisville Metro Police Department.” A grand jury indicted Handy in 2018 for lying in Chandler’s case and tampering with physical evidence in a murder case against Keith West. The tampering charge was dismissed, said Handy's lawyer, Brian Butler, who declined to comment on why his client pleaded guilty. West, now 44, spent nearly seven years behind bars for the shooting deaths of two men he said he killed in self-defense when they allegedly tried to kidnap and rape him. Read more: Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad fired after David McAtee shooting, city unrest In a motion he filed in 2018 to set aside a guilty plea in that case, West accused Handy of taping over a witness statement in his case and also failing to report exculpatory evidence found in the car in which West said he was kidnapped. In the case involving Handy’s testimony against Chandler, Commonwealth's Attorney Tom Wine said he put six prosecutors on the case who spent two years reviewing possible perjury charges against Handy but ultimately concluded there wasn't enough evidence. But the Metro Council in 2018 voted to ask then-Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear to appoint a special prosecutor, and he assigned Young, the Hardin County commonwealth's attorney, to the case. Two months later, the grand jury indicted Handy. Handy also was the lead detective in the case against Garr Keith Hardin and Jeffrey Dewayne Clark, who were convicted in the 1992 slaying of teenager Rhonda Warford. Handy testified that Hardin admitted sacrificing animals as part of a satanic ritual and later decided that he wanted to ""do a human."" But a judge ruled in 2016 that Handy wasn’t credible, citing his misconduct in the Chandler case and other evidence. The judge granted a new trial for Hardin and Clark, who had served 22 years in prison. Citing its duty to do justice, the attorney general's office dropped the case. The three men — Clark, Hardin and Chandler — spent a combined 55 years in prison before they were exonerated. Called as a witness last year in a hearing on West’s motion, Handy invoked his right against self-incrimination hundreds of times when he was grilled about framing defendants for murders by concealing and fabricating evidence. Handy, who left the Louisville Metro Police Department to join the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, retired from that position in February 2019. Asked during an interview at his home last year if he was a corrupt detective or a good one, he said, ""I'll let others be the judge of that.""

WASHINGTON — Protests were largely peaceful and the nation's streets were calmer than they have been in days since the killing of George Floyd set off demonstrations that at times brought violence and destruction along with pleas to stop police brutality and injustice against African Americans. There were scattered reports of looting in New York City overnight, and as of Wednesday morning, there had been over 9,000 arrests nationwide since the unrest began following Floyd's death on May 25 in Minneapolis. But there was a marked quiet compared with the unrest of the past few nights, which included fires and shootings in some cities. The calmer night came as many cities intensified their curfews, with authorities in New York and Washington ordering people off streets while it was still daylight. A block away from the White House, thousands of demonstrators massed following a crackdown a day earlier when officers on foot and horseback aggressively drove peaceful protesters away from Lafayette Park, clearing the way for President Donald Trump to do a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church. Tuesday's protesters faced law enforcement personnel who stood behind a black chain-link fence that was put up overnight to block access to the park. “Last night pushed me way over the edge,” said Jessica DeMaio, 40, of Washington, who attended a Floyd protest Tuesday for the first time. “Being here is better than being at home feeling helpless.” Pastors at the church prayed with demonstrators and handed out water bottles. The crowd remained in place after the city’s 7 p.m. curfew passed, defying warnings that the response from law enforcement could be even more forceful. But the crowd Tuesday was peaceful, even polite. At one point, the crowd booed when a protester climbed a light post and took down a street sign. A chant went up: “Peaceful protest!” Trump, meanwhile, amplified his hard-line calls from Monday, when he threatened to send in the military to restore order if governors didn’t do it. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,” he tweeted. “The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” Thousands of people remained in the streets of New York City Tuesday night, undeterred by an 8 p.m. curfew, though most streets were clear by early Wednesday other than police who were patrolling some areas. Midtown Manhattan was pocked with battered storefronts after Monday’s protests. Protests also passed across the U.S., including in Los Angeles, Miami, St. Paul, Minnesota, Columbia, South Carolina and Houston, where the police chief talked to peaceful demonstrators, vowing reforms. “God as my witness, change is coming,” Art Acevedo said. “And we’re going to do it the right way.” More than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up in 29 states to deal with the violence. New York is not among them, and Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he does not want the Guard. On Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo called what happened in the city “a disgrace.” “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. He said the mayor underestimated the problem, and the nation’s largest police force was not deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence. Tuesday marked the eighth straight night of the protests, which began after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd's neck while the handcuffed black man called out that he couldn't breathe. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been fired and charged with murder. The mother of George Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, said she wanted the world to know that her little girl lost a good father. “I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took,” Roxie Washington said during a Minneapolis news conference with her young daughter at her side. “I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.” Some protesters framed the burgeoning movement as a necessity after a string of killings by police. “It feels like it’s just been an endless cascade of hashtags of black people dying, and it feels like nothing’s really being done by our political leaders to actually enact real change,” said Christine Ohenzuwa, 19, who attended a peaceful protest at the Minnesota state Capitol in St. Paul. “There’s always going to be a breaking point. I think right now, we’re seeing the breaking point around the country.” “I live in this state. It’s really painful to see what’s going on, but it’s also really important to understand that it’s connected to a system of racial violence,” she said. Meanwhile, governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, rejected Trump's threat to send in the military, with some saying troops would be unnecessary and others questioning whether the government has such authority and warning that such a step would be dangerous. A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the president is not rushing to send in the military and that his goal was to pressure governors to deploy more National Guard members. Such use of the military would mark a stunning federal intervention rarely seen in modern American history. Amid the protests, nine states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries that tested the nation’s ability to run elections while balancing a pandemic and sweeping social unrest. Joe Biden won hundreds more delegates and was on the cusp of formally securing the Democratic presidential nomination.",0.0
